[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [10] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

          [21] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [25] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."

          [5] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
          [6] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
          [4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
          [5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
          [6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
          [7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
          [8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."

          [11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
          [12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
          [13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
          [14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."

          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [48] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [49] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [50] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [51] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [52] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [53] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [54] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [55] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [10] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
          [11] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [12] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [13] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [14] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [15] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [16] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [17] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."

          [21] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [25] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
          [26] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
          [2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
          [3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
          [4] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications."
          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] .

          [2] "Pt-based catalyst has been developed as a well-known type of catalysts that shows considerable activity for PDH reaction. It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
          [3] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications [7] ,[8] ."
          [4] "In this context, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9] , Pt-Ga [6] ,[10] , Pt-Cu [1] , Pt-Sn [11] ,[12] ,[13] , and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6] ."
          [5] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
          [6] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."
          [7] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] ."
          [8] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
          [4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
          [5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
          [6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
          [7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
          [8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
          [9] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
          [10] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
          [12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
          [13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
          [14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
          [22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
          [23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."

          [26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
          [27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
          [28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

          [31] "First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail."
          [33] "Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed."
          [34] "For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed."
          [35] "Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance."
          [36] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [37] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [38] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [39] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [40] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [41] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [42] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
          [43] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [48] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

          [50] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [51] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [52] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [10] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."
          [11] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [12] "In this report, we provide an overview on CH activation and reaction routes to alkane dehydrogenation."
          [13] "We seek to gain insights about components of the active sites of CH activation to provide a platform for rational design of new efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
          [14] "We focus on propane dehydrogenation because of the need for alternative and/or complementary technology for propene production to supplement existing technologies."
          [15] "We survey non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation approaches, and examine reaction routes that are intermediate between these two main approaches."
          [16] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [21] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."
          [25] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."
          [11] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
          [2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
          [3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
          [4] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications."
          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance [4] ,[5] ,[6] . More importantly, the availability of abundant shale gas containing light alkanes makes PDH more attracting in terms of the economy and environment."
          [2] "Pt-based catalyst has been developed as a well-known type of catalysts that shows considerable activity for PDH reaction. It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."
          [3] "On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications [7] ,[8] ."
          [4] "In this context, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9] , Pt-Ga [6] ,[10] , Pt-Cu [1] , Pt-Sn [11] ,[12] ,[13] , and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6] ."
          [5] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
          [6] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."
          [7] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] ."
          [8] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
          [4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
          [5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
          [6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
          [7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
          [8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
          [9] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
          [10] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
          [12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
          [13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
          [14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
          [22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
          [23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
          [25] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
          [26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
          [27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
          [28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [11] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [12] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

          [18] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [19] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

          [27] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [28] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [29] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [21] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based propylene and eligible catalysts with good overall performance are still being explored."
          [2] "However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes."
          [3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost."

          [5] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9] ."
          [6] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15] ,[16] , it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."
          [7] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17] ."
          [8] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[18] or SiO2 [19] ,[20] ,[21] are most widely used."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
          [4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
          [5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
          [6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
          [7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
          [8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."

          [11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
          [12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
          [13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
          [14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
          [22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
          [23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."

          [26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
          [27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
          [28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."

          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."

          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."

          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [11] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [12] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."

          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [10] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

          [21] "Despite more than two decades of investigations on ODH of light alkanes, there is not yet an ODH catalyst that gives a propene yield sufficient to be attractive to industry."
          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."
          [10] "Smaller barrier difference on Pt(111) indicates a stronger preference for propylene desorption on Pt(111) compared with Pt(100)."

[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."

          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
          [22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
          [23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
          [25] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
          [26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
          [27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
          [28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[1] "However, conversion of lower alkanes to valuable chemicals often involves indirect or multi-step reaction routes. Developing direct routes to obtain key organic chemicals from lower alkanes would benefit industry."
          [2] "Lower alkanes are relatively inert, and they exhibit little or no reactivity at conditions typical for activating functional group reactions in organic compounds because they lack low-lying vacant orbitals or lone pair electrons."
          [3] "Thus, the main challenge of using lower alkanes to produce value-added chemicals is the development of economic and environment friendly processes for partial oxidation or selective functionalization of lower alkanes to the desired target compounds."
          [4] "Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes because they have Ï€-electrons. Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."
          [5] "Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes."
          [6] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [7] "Direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is an energy intensive reaction; however, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has the potential to lower the energy requirement for achieving dehydrogenation."
          [8] "Although ODH is attractive because of the energy intensification advantage, commercial ODH technologies hinge on innovative catalyst and process design, i.e. proper synergy of the endothermic dehydrogenation step with the exothermic hydrogen combustion and design of selective CH and hydrogen combustion catalysts."
          [9] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

          [22] "The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] ."
          [23] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."
          [24] "Thus, ODH of alkanes takes place at lower temperature compared to the corresponding non-ODH. This lower temperature requirement of ODH compared to non-ODH and cracking is encouraging and provides motivation for continued efforts to develop ODH into an industrial technology."

[1] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."
          [2] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."
          [3] "Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."
          [4] "The hydroxyl anchoring method could be an effective approach to anchor active sites."
          [5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."
          [6] "For the traditional microporous zeolites and metal oxide supports, utilizing different morphologies of supports with large outer surfaces can efficiently decrease the diffusion restriction in heterogeneous catalytic systems."
          [7] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."
          [8] "Thus, deeply figuring out the specific effect along with the functional mechanism of the promoters and exploring cheap promoters are still urgent."
          [9] "At the present stage, the controllable introduction of heteroatoms can be achieved through SOMC."
          [10] "However, excess ligands are usually required to form coordinative metal compounds, and the difficulty comes with the selection of proper ligands that are based on different supports and metals, making this technique uneconomical and complex."
          [11] "Preparing this type of supports usually needs rare templates, which hinders the application in industrial production."
          [12] "Constructing hierarchical zeolites as PDH supports provides an effective solution to alleviate the diffusion limitation due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional microporous zeolites and mesoporous zeolites."

[1] "Currently commercial PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Cr- and Pt-based catalysts. The main problems of Pt-based catalyst are its low selectivity to propylene and fast deactivation caused by coke formation."
          [2] "Yang et al.9193 reported detailed studies of propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111), Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, including 17 dehydrogenation steps (Fig. 8) and 11 CC bond breaking steps. The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."
          [3] "Although desorption barriers are higher than the dehydrogenation barrier from propylene on both surfaces, the experimentally observed selectivities of propylene are still higher than 85% in both cases. The reason is that DFT results discussed here did not include thermodynamic correction, which would significantly reduce the free energy barrier for desorption steps due to the large entropy of gas phase propylene compared with the adsorbed ones."
          [4] "A stronger activity of the stepped surface for the dehydrogenation mechanism has also been reported by a work of Chiu et al. originally addressing the hydrogenation of propylene on the stepped Pt(221) surface."
          [5] "The dehydrogenation and re-hydrogenation barriers, which are prior and after CC bond breaking, respectively, are very similar to each other in all three ring-opening pathways (Fig. 9). However, transition states and barriers of the CC bond breaking vary notably."
          [6] "The calculated CHC dissociation barrier is 138 kJ mol1, higher than the dehydrogenation barrier to form CHC, indicating possible accumulation of CHC during this conversion, which is in good agreement with experimental observations."
          [7] "The lowest CC bond breaking barrier on Pd(111) is 122 kJ mol1 and the corresponding precursor is the C2 dimer."
          [8] "Although turnover frequencies (TOFs) showed that the cubic particles are more active than octahedral ones, higher propylene selectivity was observed on octahedral Pt with large surface area of Pt(111)."
          [9] "On Pt(100), the binding energy of propylene is 118 kJ mol1, which is 66 kJ mol1 higher than its dehydrogenation barrier. The binding of propylene on Pt(111) decreases to 94 kJ mol1, and the following dehydrogenation barrier increases to 73 kJ mol1."

Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency. Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx."
          [2] "Additionally, the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate."
          [3] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."
          [4] "In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a moderate dehydrogenation technology."
          [5] "In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, ammonia synthesis, olefin refinment and hydrogen storage with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH can promote the transformation of propane."
          [6] "Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermochemical dehydrogenation process."
          [7] "However, the performances of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their insufficient CH activation ability."
          [8] "More importantly, the reaction mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments."
          [9] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."
          [10] "Metal oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely developed with the expectation that they could be superior alternatives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts."
          [11] "However, their dehydrogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with the industrial catalysts."
          [12] "In addition, the types of supports, promoters and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst structures."
          [13] "Therefore, developing novel efficient methods to further improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired."
          [14] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging."
          [15] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
          [16] "For industrial PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of different Sn species as well as the coking behaviors are still undiscovered."
          [17] "For metal oxide-based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces."
          [18] "For example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, which makes it difficult to identify the actual active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions."
          [19] "Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist in explaining experimental results."
          [20] "However, the matching degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes."
          [21] "It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between structure and activity."
          [22] "For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction conditions."
          [23] "In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydrogenation catalysts."
          [24] "Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is still full of grand challenges."
          [25] "The preparation of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those shaped and single atom catalysts."
          [26] "Recent studies on single-site catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or single site Pt for PDH."
          [27] "However, the single atom Pt still suffers from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH conditions."
          [28] "Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane dehydrogenation."
          [29] "Novel methods such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the scale-up of production of single atom catalysts."
          [30] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the development of dehydrogenation technologies, the efficient adsorption/activation of propane and subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically challenging."
          [31] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
          [32] "The challenges and perspectives of PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development."
          [33] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."
          [34] "Therefore, the reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and productivity."
          [35] "These restrictions lead to great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst design."
          [36] "Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired."
          [37] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."
          [38] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [11] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [12] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
          [14] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

          [31] "First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail."
          [33] "Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed."
          [34] "For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed."
          [35] "Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance."

          [43] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

          [51] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
          [52] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
