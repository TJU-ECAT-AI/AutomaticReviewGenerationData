          [1] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
          [3] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
          [5] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
          [6] "Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction."
          [7] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
          [8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
          [9] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
          [10] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [11] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
          [12] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
          [14] "Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues."

          [31] "First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction."
          [32] "Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail."
          [33] "Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed."
          [34] "For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed."
          [35] "Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance."

          [43] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [44] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
          [45] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
          [46] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
          [47] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
          [48] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

          [51] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions, while considering thermodynamic limitations. Researchers are addressing these needs by developing alternative catalysts, such as metal oxides, which have received significant attention but have not yet provided a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems. These alternative formulations often deactivate too fast due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration. Further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and improve energy efficiency. Additionally, strategies are being explored to overcome the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The market conditions are very favorable for PDH due to the price difference between propane and propylene. Dehydrogenation technologies have the advantage of being on-purpose techniques, yielding exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. Industrial dehydrogenation processes are optimized to produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. Dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many are already under construction. There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes due to increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, and a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, resulting in sharp increases in butadiene prices and sparking investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan.

          在工业丙烯生产中，丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抵抗副反应的催化剂，同时考虑到热力学限制。研究人员正在通过开发替代催化剂，如金属氧化物，来解决这些需求，这些催化剂已经受到了广泛关注，但尚未提供PtSn和CrOx系统的可行替代方案。这些替代配方往往由于焦炭沉积和无法通过再生完全恢复其活性而过快失活。需要进一步的进展来降低贵金属负载，提高催化剂稳定性，并提高脱氢过程的能源效率。此外，正在探索策略以克服在高温下有限的平衡转化率和副反应的普遍性。由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，PDH的市场条件非常有利。脱氢技术的优势在于它们是有目的的技术，仅产生特定的烯烃，而不是混合产品。工业脱氢过程被优化以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。全球已宣布了数十个新的PDH装置，其中许多正在建设中。由于来自汽车行业的特别需求增加，以及由于石脑油裂解的高成本导致供应减少，导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨，丁烷脱氢(BDH)的情况也类似有利。这反过来又刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢(BDH)装置的投资。
