[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe. This has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method to meet the forecast market demand for olefins. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include improved energy efficiency, as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal. However, higher olefin yields are needed for propane ODH to be cost-effective compared to current technologies. Additionally, more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses and higher fixed costs, especially considering the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了演变，由于其需求增长速度超过了乙烯，尤其是在西欧，这推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，以满足对烯烃的预测市场需求。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括提高能源效率，因为氧化脱氢（ODH）是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的。然而，丙烷ODH需要更高的烯烃产率，才能与当前技术具有成本效益。此外，更放热的反应意味着更高的能量损失和更高的固定成本，特别是考虑到丙烷ODH中二氧化碳作为主要副产品的生产。
