[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe. This has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method to meet the forecast market demand for olefins. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include improved energy efficiency, as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal. However, higher olefin yields are needed for propane ODH to be cost-effective compared to current technologies. Additionally, more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses and higher fixed costs, especially considering the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了演变，由于其需求增长速度超过了乙烯，尤其是在西欧，这推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，以满足对烯烃的预测市场需求。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括提高能源效率，因为氧化脱氢（ODH）是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的。然而，丙烷ODH需要更高的烯烃产率，才能与当前技术具有成本效益。此外，更放热的反应意味着更高的能量损失和更高的固定成本，特别是考虑到丙烷ODH中二氧化碳作为主要副产品的生产。

1.The demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, is projected to rise significantly in the near future. Propylene demand is growing faster than ethylene demand, especially in Western Europe. Current olefin production does not align with forecasted market demand. Oxidative processes for producing chemicals from alkanes have been widely studied in recent decades. Successful commercial technologies will combine catalyst performance with innovative process designs. Improved energy efficiency and process simplicity are incentives for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). To match the cost of current propylene production methods, propane ODH must achieve higher yields. Exothermic reactions like ODH result in higher energy losses and fixed costs, particularly when considering CO2 production as a by-product.

1.对烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求预计在不久的将来会显著增加。丙烯的需求增长速度比乙烯快，特别是在西欧。当前的烯烃生产与预测的市场需求不一致。在过去几十年中，从烷烃出发通过氧化过程生产化学品一直是研究的热点话题。成功的商业化技术将是那些将催化剂性能特征与创新工艺设计相结合的技术。相反，在这种情况下，改进的能量效率（ODH是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的）和工艺的简单性是有效的激励。这意味着，例如，在从丙烷生产丙烯腈的情况下，60%的产率足以与当前从丙烯出发的技术获得成本等效性（由于丙烷和丙烯之间的成本差异），而在丙烷ODH合成丙烯的情况下，需要比当前技术获得的更好的烯烃产率。此外，兰格[3]强调，更放热的反应意味着更高的能量损失（即，原料和产品的燃烧热之间的差异），因此，更高的固定成本，特别是如果考虑到CO2的生产，这是烷烃ODH的主要副产品。
