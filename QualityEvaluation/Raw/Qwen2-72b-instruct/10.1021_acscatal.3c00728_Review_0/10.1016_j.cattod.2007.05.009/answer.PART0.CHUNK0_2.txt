[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is growing faster than that for ethylene, particularly in Western Europe. This demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because current olefin production technologies do not align with forecasted market demands. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include improved energy efficiency, as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is exothermic, unlike dehydrogenation and cracking, which are endothermic. This process simplicity and energy efficiency are incentives for its adoption. However, to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications, better olefin yields are required from propane ODH than those obtained with current technologies. Additionally, the higher exothermicity of reactions implies higher energy losses and fixed costs, especially considering the production of CO2 as a by-product in alkane ODH.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了演变，因为其需求增长速度超过了乙烯，特别是在西欧。这种需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为当前的烯烃生产技术与预测的市场需求不一致。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括改进的能源效率，因为氧化脱氢（ODH）是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的。这种过程的简单性和能源效率是其采用的激励。但是，为了满足丙烯在各种应用中的增长需求，从丙烷ODH获得的烯烃产量必须比当前技术获得的产量更高。此外，反应的更高放热性意味着更高的能量损失和固定成本，特别是考虑到在烷烃ODH中二氧化碳作为副产品的生产。
