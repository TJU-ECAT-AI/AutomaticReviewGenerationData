[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, particularly in Western Europe, where the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene. This drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method to meet the forecast market demand for olefins. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal) and process simplicity. However, for propylene synthesis by propane ODH to be commercially viable, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies.

1.丙烯在化工行业的意义发生了演变，特别是在西欧，丙烯的需求增长速度超过了乙烯，这推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，以满足对烯烃的预测市场需求。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括提高能源效率（ODH是放热的，而脱氢和裂解是吸热的）和工艺的简化。然而，对于丙烯通过丙烷ODH合成来说，要实现商业可行性，需要比现有技术获得更好的烯烃产量。
