[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
[5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe. This drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because the current production of olefins does not align with the forecast market demand. The successful commercial technologies will be those that combine catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs. In the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, improved energy efficiency and process simplicity are effective incentives. However, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies to meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了演变，由于其需求增长速度超过了乙烯，尤其是在西欧，这推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。因为当前的烯烃生产与预测的市场需求不一致。成功的商业技术将是那些将催化剂性能特征与创新工艺设计相结合的技术。在丙烯通过丙烷ODH合成的情况下，提高能源效率和工艺简单性是有效的激励措施。但是，为了满足这种多功能烯烃在各种应用中的增长需求，需要比当前技术获得的更好的烯烃产量。
