[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved, with its increasing demand driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Traditionally, light olefins like ethylene and propylene were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. However, in recent years, natural gas has become an abundant resource, making it economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. The cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, with only small amounts of heavier olefins formed. This has created a gap between the production of C3 and C4 olefins and their market demand. As a result, on-purpose processes, primarily nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach lie in its ability to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications while utilizing abundant natural gas resources.

1.丙烯在化工行业的意义已经演变，其需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。传统上，像乙烯和丙烯这样的轻质烯烃是通过裂解石油衍生的石脑油生产的。然而，近年来，天然气已成为一种丰富的资源，使其在经济上可行，可以改造石脑油裂解装置，使用乙烷作为原料。与裂解石脑油相比，乙烷的裂解主要产生乙烯，只有少量的重烯烃形成。这在C3和C4烯烃的生产与市场需求之间造成了差距。因此，出于目的的工艺，主要是非氧化性烷烃脱氢(DH)，已被工业实施以弥补这一差距。这种方法的经济和环境优势在于，它能够利用丰富的天然气资源，满足丙烯在各种应用中的日益增长的需求。
