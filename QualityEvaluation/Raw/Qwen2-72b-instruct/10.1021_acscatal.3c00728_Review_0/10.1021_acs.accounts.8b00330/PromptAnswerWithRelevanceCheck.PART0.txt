[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved, becoming a crucial organic feedstock with a global production capacity of 110 million tons. Traditionally, propene and other light olefins were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. However, in recent years, natural gas has become an abundant and economically viable resource, leading to the retrofitting of naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. Unlike naphtha cracking, which produces a wide range of light olefins, ethane cracking mainly yields ethylene with only small amounts of heavier olefins. This has resulted in a gap between the production of C3 and C4 olefins and their market demand. To address this, on-purpose processes, primarily nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been adopted industrially to meet the growing demand for propene in various applications. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the ability to efficiently produce propene from abundant natural gas resources, potentially reducing reliance on oil and offering a more sustainable production method to meet the increasing needs for this versatile olefin.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经演变，成为一种关键的有机原料，全球生产能力达到1.1亿吨。传统上，丙烯和其他轻质烯烃是通过裂解石油衍生的石脑油来生产的。然而，近年来，天然气已成为一种丰富且经济上可行的资源，导致石脑油裂解装置被改造为使用乙烷作为原料。与石脑油裂解不同，乙烷裂解主要产生乙烯，只有少量的重质烯烃。这导致了C3和C4烯烃的生产与市场需求之间的差距。为了解决这一问题，工业上采用了目的性工艺，主要是非氧化性烷烃脱氢(DH)，以满足丙烯在各种应用中日益增长的需求。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括能够从丰富的天然气资源中高效生产丙烯，可能减少对石油的依赖，并提供一种更可持续的生产方法，以满足对这种多功能烯烃日益增长的需求。

[2] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity. (4) These factors increase capital and operational costs for DH plants."

[3] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."
