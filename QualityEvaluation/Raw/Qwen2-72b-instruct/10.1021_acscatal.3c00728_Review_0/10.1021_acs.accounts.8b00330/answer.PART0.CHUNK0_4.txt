[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap."

[2] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity. (4) These factors increase capital and operational costs for DH plants."

[3] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as its demand has increased, leading to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Traditionally, light olefins like ethylene and propylene were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. However, with the emergence of natural gas as an abundant resource, it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. This shift has created a gap in the production of C3 and C4 olefins, which has driven the implementation of on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), to meet market demand. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the potential for lower capital and operational costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes, as well as the exothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation process, which is not equilibrium limited and does not suffer from coke deposition.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性随着其需求的增加而演变，这导致了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。传统上，像乙烯和丙烯这样的轻质烯烃是通过裂解石油衍生的石脑油来生产的。然而，随着天然气作为一种丰富资源的出现，经济上可行的是改造石脑油裂解装置以使用乙烷作为原料。这种转变在C3和C4烯烃的生产上造成了缺口，这推动了旨在满足市场需求的定向工艺的实施，主要是非氧化性烷烃脱氢（DH）。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括由于较低的操作温度和避免催化剂再生方案而可能降低的资本和运营成本，以及氧化脱氢过程的放热性质，它不是平衡受限的，不会遭受焦炭沉积。
