[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved, becoming one of the most important organic feedstocks with a global production capacity of 110 million tons. Traditionally, propene and other light olefins were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. However, in recent years, natural gas has become an abundant resource, making it economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. Unlike naphtha cracking, which produces a wide range of light olefins, ethane cracking mainly produces ethylene, with only small amounts of heavier olefins. This has led to a gap between the production of C3 and C4 olefins and their market demand. To address this, on-purpose processes, primarily non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been implemented industrially to meet the growing demand for propene. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the ability to produce propene more efficiently and with lower emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking methods, making it a preferred production method for meeting the increasing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

1.丙烯在化工行业的意义已经演变，成为最重要的有机原料之一，全球产能达到1.1亿吨。传统上，丙烯和其他轻质烯烃是通过裂解石油衍生的石脑油生产的。然而，近年来，天然气已成为一种丰富的资源，使得改造石脑油裂解装置使用乙烷作为原料在经济上变得可行。与石脑油裂解不同，后者产生广泛的轻质烯烃，乙烷裂解主要产生乙烯，只有少量的重烯烃。这导致了C3和C4烯烃的生产与市场需求之间的差距。为了解决这一问题，工业上实施了目的性工艺，主要是非氧化性烷烃脱氢(DH)，以满足丙烯日益增长的需求。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括与传统石脑油裂解方法相比，能够更高效地生产丙烯，并且排放更低，使其成为满足各种应用中对这种多功能烯烃日益增长的需求的首选生产方法。
