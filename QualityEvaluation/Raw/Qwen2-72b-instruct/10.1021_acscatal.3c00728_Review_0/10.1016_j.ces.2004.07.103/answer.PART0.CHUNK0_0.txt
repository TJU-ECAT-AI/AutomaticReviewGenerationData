1.Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the potential for higher yields of propene, reduced energy consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional production methods. Propane dehydrogenation can meet the growing needs for propene in various applications, such as the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic rubbers, while offering a more sustainable and cost-effective solution.
