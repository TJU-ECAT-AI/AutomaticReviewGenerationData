[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced, traditionally made from naphtha. However, changes in the global supply chain have led to shortages, making direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, an attractive alternative. The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its potential energy savings and enhanced reaction efficiency. This approach is economically and environmentally advantageous in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications, as it can reduce energy consumption by 45% and decrease the production of unwanted CO and CO2.
