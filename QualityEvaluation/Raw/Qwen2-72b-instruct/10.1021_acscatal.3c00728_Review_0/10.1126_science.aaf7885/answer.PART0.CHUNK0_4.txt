[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain, creating shortages of propene which has mainly been produced from naphtha. The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it is an attractive alternative to direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas. However, existing approaches to propane dehydrogenation produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include potential energy savings of 45% of energy consumption, which, when coupled with the high demand for propene and the energy consumed in its production, illustrates the potential impact of propane dehydrogenation if it could be implemented on a large scale.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了变化，由于全球供应链的变化，导致了丙烯的短缺，丙烯主要从石脑油中生产。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它是从天然气成分丙烷直接转化的有吸引力的替代方案。然而，现有的丙烷脱氢方法会产生大量不希望的CO和CO2。丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势包括潜在的能源节省，即能源消耗的45%，这与丙烯的高需求和生产中消耗的能源相结合，说明了如果丙烷脱氢能在大规模上实施，其潜在的影响。
