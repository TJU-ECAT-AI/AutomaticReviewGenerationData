[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation."
[4] "The potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption."
[5] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain, creating shortages of propene which has mainly been produced from naphtha. The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, is an attractive alternative. However, existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2. The prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 is the key scientific challenge that must be overcome. The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include potential energy savings of 45% of the energy consumption, and the potential impact of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) if it could be implemented on a large scale, considering the demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，由于全球供应链的变化，导致了丙烯的短缺，丙烯主要从石脑油中生产。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为直接从丙烷（天然气的成分）转化是一个有吸引力的替代方案。然而，现有的方法会产生大量不希望的CO和CO2。防止丙烯产品容易氧化成更热力学稳定的CO和CO2（COx）仍然是必须克服的关键科学挑战。缺乏动力学控制确定了发现具有控制这种部分氧化能力的替代材料的必要性。丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势包括潜在的能源节省，可以达到能源消耗的45%，如果氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）能够大规模实施，考虑到丙烯的需求约为100,000 kt，其生产消耗的能量约为1 quad。

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced, traditionally made from naphtha. However, changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The direct conversion of propane, a component of natural gas, to propene via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include potential energy savings of 45% of energy consumption, which is significant considering the demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy. This method also avoids the production of unwanted CO and CO2, which are byproducts of existing approaches.
