[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain, creating shortages of propene, which has traditionally been produced from naphtha. The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it is an attractive alternative to the existing approaches that produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include potential energy savings of 45% of the energy consumption, which is significant considering the high demand for propene and the energy-intensive nature of its production. Implementing propane dehydrogenation on a large scale could have a substantial impact on meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了变化，由于全球供应链的变化，导致丙烯短缺，而丙烯传统上是从石脑油中生产的。丙烯需求的增加正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为与现有的产生大量不希望的CO和CO2的方法相比，这是一种有吸引力的替代方案。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括潜在的能源节省，可以节省45%的能源消耗，考虑到丙烯的高需求和生产能源密集型的性质，这一点非常重要。如果大规模实施丙烷脱氢，将对满足各种应用中丙烯日益增长的需求产生重大影响。
