[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[2] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced, traditionally made from naphtha. However, changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The direct conversion of propane, a component of natural gas, to propene via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include potential energy savings of 45% of energy consumption, which is significant considering the demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy. This method also avoids the production of unwanted CO and CO2, which are byproducts of existing approaches.

1.丙烯在化工行业中的重要性已经演变，它是产量最高的有机化学品之一，传统上主要从石脑油中生产。然而，全球供应链的变化正在造成短缺，这推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。直接将丙烷，天然气的成分，通过与氧气反应转化为丙烯是一个有吸引力的替代方案。这种方法的经济和环境优势包括潜在的能源节省，估计为能源消耗的45%，考虑到丙烯的需求约为1亿吨，其生产消耗约1夸德的能源，这一点意义重大。这种方法还避免了现有方法中产生的不希望的CO和CO2的副产品。
