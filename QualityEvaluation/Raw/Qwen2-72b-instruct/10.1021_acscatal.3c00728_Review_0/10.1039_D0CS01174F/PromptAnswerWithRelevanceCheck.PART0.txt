[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."
[2] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."
[3] "In addition, under such tough operation conditions, sintering and coking become serious and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, which thus requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts under high temperature oxidative conditions.15,1822"
[4] "Coke formation may result in serious consequences, e.g. pressure drop, flow blockage, and decrease of production capacity, leading to low production efficiency.2325"

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, with its demand driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Propene, a versatile olefin, is increasingly demanded across various applications, leading to its worldwide consumption soaring to approximately 115 million tons in 2019. This demand is met primarily through technologies such as petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO), and Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), which are characterized by high energy consumption and significant carbon emissions, contradicting sustainable development criteria. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is expected to be more widely applied in the future, with forecasts suggesting it could supply around 30% of global propylene production by 2025, thanks to advancements in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages by potentially reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions compared to traditional methods, making it a preferred choice for meeting the growing needs for propene in a sustainable manner.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了显著变化，其需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。作为一种多功能烯烃，丙烯在各种应用中需求量日益增加，导致2019年全球消费量飙升至约1.15亿吨。这种需求主要通过诸如石油衍生蒸汽裂解、流体催化裂解（FCC）、甲醇制烯烃（MTO）和费托合成制烯烃（FTO）等技术来满足，这些技术的特点是高能耗和大量碳排放，与可持续发展标准相悖。预计丙烷脱氢（PDH）将在未来得到更广泛的应用，据预测，到2025年，它可能供应全球约30%的丙烯生产，这得益于在大规模开采天然气和页岩气方面的进展。与传统方法相比，这种方法在潜在降低能耗和碳排放方面提供了经济和环境优势，使其成为以可持续方式满足丙烯日益增长需求的首选选择。

[2] "In 2018, the proved reserves of natural gas reached 197 trillion cubic meters. These gas resources are composed of considerable amounts of light alkanes, e.g. methane, ethane, and propane, which can be separated from the natural gas,4 and have been mainly used as fuel rather than chemical feedstocks in the past few decades owing to their relatively inert chemical properties compared to olefins. Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
[3] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Propene, as a versatile olefin, is widely used in various applications. The growing demand for propene is pushing the chemical industry to shift from energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly processes to more sustainable catalytic methods that produce olefins with high atom economy, low energy consumption, and low carbon emissions. The large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas, which contain significant amounts of light alkanes like propane, is expected to lead to a wider application of propane dehydrogenation in the coming years. This approach is economically and environmentally advantageous as it meets the growing needs for propene while reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The increasing demand for propene is due to its use as a feedstock for the production of polymers, such as polypropylene, which is a key component of the chemical industry. The demand for propene has soared to approximately 115 million tons in 2019. The traditional technologies for producing propene, such as steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, methanol to olefins, and Fischer-Tropsch to olefins, are energy-intensive and produce a large amount of carbon emissions, which contradicts sustainable development criteria. Propane dehydrogenation is expected to be applied more widely in the future, as it is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. It is forecasted that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane will supply approximately 30% of the global propene production by 2025. The rich availability and low cost of natural gas and shale gas have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins.
