[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption. This raises challenges both scientifically and technologically, and drives a shift of chemical engineering from energy-demanding chemical processes to more environmentally friendly protocols of catalysis to produce olefins with high atom economy, low energy consumption and low emission."
[2] "In 2018, the proved reserves of natural gas reached 197 trillion cubic meters. These gas resources are composed of considerable amounts of light alkanes, e.g. methane, ethane, and propane, which can be separated from the natural gas,4 and have been mainly used as fuel rather than chemical feedstocks in the past few decades owing to their relatively inert chemical properties compared to olefins. Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
[3] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand, which is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Propene, as a versatile olefin, is widely used in various applications. The growing demand for propene is pushing the chemical industry to shift from energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly processes to more sustainable catalytic methods that produce olefins with high atom economy, low energy consumption, and low carbon emissions. The large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas, which contain significant amounts of light alkanes like propane, is expected to lead to a wider application of propane dehydrogenation in the coming years. This approach is economically and environmentally advantageous as it meets the growing needs for propene while reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.
