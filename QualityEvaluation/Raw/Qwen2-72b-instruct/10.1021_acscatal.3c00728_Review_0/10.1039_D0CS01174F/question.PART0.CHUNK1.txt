2.4.1 Nature of the active sites Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization. Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin. The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates.
In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer. Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the B/N ratio at the edge (1.28, point 2 in Fig. 10b) was higher than that of the in-plane (0.95, point 4 in Fig. 10b). This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d). Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction, which was supported by the FTIR spectra that showed that the OH groups interacted with the reactant and incorporated into the reaction network.39 Fig. 10 Structural characterization of the BNOH catalyst:39 (a) Aberration-corrected TEM images; (b) HAADF-STEM image; (c) B1s, N1s and O1s X-ray photoelectron spectra; (d) 2D 11B MQ MAS NMR and 1H MAS NMR (inset) spectra. Reproduced from ref. 39 with permission from Wiley-VCH, copyright 2017.The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction. This was different from the abovementioned hypothesis39 that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites. In a later work, Hermans and coworkers characterized80 the structure of h-BN and BNNTs materials in the ODHP reaction by using 11B solid-state NMR, SEM and soft-XAS, and identified the existence of B(OH)xO3x (where x = 03) phase under reaction conditions (Fig. 11a and b). This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects.39 Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations.Fig. 11 Characterization of spent h-BN: (a) 2D 11B MQMAS spectrum of spent h-BN;80 (b) 2D 11B  1H D-RINEPT spectrum;80 Reproduced from ref. 80 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2019.

This study stressed the important role of the zig-zag edge of h-BN in the ODH of propane, which was consistent with the opinion in earlier work,39 but remained to be improved for a fair comparison of the various potential reactive sites by using an equivalent reference point.The governing role of oxygenated boron species in the ODH of light alkanes has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, e.g. B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron,40 and silicon boride203 In these catalytic systems, resembling surface species and kinetic behaviors to h-BN in the ODH reaction were observed. These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces.This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species. To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique,44 two of which on the upfield side (B(3a) and B(3B) in Fig. 7a) were considered as the responsible species for the activity by analyzing their variations before and after the ODHP test. With the aid of DFT calculations, these species were characterized as the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species, respectively.The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.46,171 These studies also showed that clustered distribution of tricoordinated boron species is necessary. In the study using a layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) with defective trigonal boron species as the catalyst,171 abundant presence of defective trigonal boron species (OBOH and B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2) species) was reported based on the data of FT-IR and 11B MAS NMR, and proposed to be responsible for the activity of propane ODH. These types of species (Fig. 7c) were also proposed to present in the amorphous silica supported oxidized boron catalytic system during the ODH of propane captured by IR, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 11c, d and e).138 When boron was incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 species (equivalent as B(3c) in ref. 44 or isolated BO3 in ref. 138), its activity to catalyze the ODHP reaction was lost.46 This result gives a new perspective to the active sites and implicated that their accumulation at the surface was a prerequisite to promote the ODH reaction. Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work.44
2.4.2 Reaction mechanisms Characterization of the kinetics of the ODH reactions via advanced experimental techniques provided abundant information to understand the underlying mechanism. The combination of in situ FTIR and online MS showed39 that the signals of OH groups of the BNOH catalyst remained unchanged in the absence of O2 in the feed gas, but diminished in the presence of O2, implicating that the co-presence of alkane and O2 is a prerequisite in the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts. The diminished signals of an OH group could be recovered under a steam atmosphere (Fig. 12a), which, together with the isotope labelling experiment, showed the direct involvement of water in the replenish of the BOH groups. These spectroscopic data and kinetic experiments indicated that the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of OH(D) groups were involved in the reaction process (Fig. 12b and c), which also lent support to a later computational study of the mechanism that considered the breakage of the BO(H) bond during the reaction.204 The kinetic analysis suggested that the reaction order of O2 was 0.5, implicating the dissociation of O2 in the ODH reaction. The reaction order of C3H8 was calculated to be 2, and the kinetic isotope effects of CH cleavage were measured to be 1.4 for primary hydrogen abstraction and 1.5 for secondary hydrogen abstraction. The results suggested that activation of propane determined the total reaction rate, based on which a reaction mechanism was proposed78,81 (Fig. 12d) initiated by the reaction of BOH groups with O2 to generate active species that may further dehydrogenate propane to produce propylene and water, and recover BOH groups.

Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a), which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry. The BNO radical tended to react with ethane leading to the production of alkane radicals (C3H7 and C2H5), which were then dehydrogenated by O2 or H2O2, and produced C2H4. This radical-mediated mechanism was supported by later studies of the ODH of propane on supported boron oxide catalysts44 and on h-BN.91 In the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalyst,91 the inactive diluent (SiC) was found to be able to affect the gas-phase chemistry (Fig. 13b), and the BOx sites of the h-BN were proposed to act as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which can decompose to products in the gas phase and, if reacting with O2, generate HO2 and HO radicals. This radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanism was previously proposed for the Li/MgO and Li/Dy/MgO catalyst systems,205 which catalyzed selective oxidative cracking of n-butane under O2-lean conditions. This pattern of selectivity appeared nearly identical as in the h-BN catalytic system, implicating potential similarities in the mechanisms between these catalytic systems. Further support came from a recent direct detection206 of the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3) in the ODH of propane by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUP-MS) in which the C3H6 was revealed to mainly form on the h-BN surface while C2 and C1 products were generated from catalyst surfaces and gas-phase pathways.

(b) Propane conversion as a function of total catalyst bed residence time using diluted h-BN catalysts.91 Reproduced from ref. 91 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2018.Other studies also enriched the understanding of the reaction mechanism. A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study of the ODH of ethane41 proposed that the C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption at a low temperature (XC2H6 < 10%), and at high temperature (XC2H6 > 10%), the ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites, and completed the reaction cycle over BO sites.In the studies of the ODH of propane, the selectivity of C2-products was noticed to be much higher than that of C1-products over an h-BN catalyst in ODH of propane, implicating complicated channels leading to these cracking products. This puzzle was solved in a later study207 and the C2-products were reported to be formed via oxidative coupling of methyl radicals in addition to the channels of CC breaking of propane, which explained the higher selectivity of C2-products than the C1-products. This hypothesis offered further support to the radical-mediated mechanism. 3 Progress in carbon-based catalysts for ODH
3.1 Carbon-based catalysts used in ODH
Carbonaceous materials as catalysts in ODH reactions were first reported in the 1960s. In earlier studies the pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile,208 polynaphthoquinone,209 and surface modified activated carbons210,211 were used as catalysts, and the oxygenated functional groups, e.g. carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface were generally considered key to their activity.Although the production technology of activated carbon is mature in industry, this amorphous carbon with poor crystallinity and abundant micropores usually has the risk of combusting at high temperature and in an oxidative atmosphere. Nanocarbon materials with high crystallinity would be more antioxidative to act as stable catalysts in ODH reactions. Schlgl's group first reported nanocarbons (carbon nanofilaments (CNFs), and onion-like carbons (OLCs)) as efficient metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) compared to soot, graphite and industrial KFe catalysts.212,213 CNFs also exhibited considerable catalytic performance in the ODH of propane to propylene,214 but suffered from severe gasification under harsh oxidative reaction conditions, which may be alleviated by loading phosphoric oxides in CNFs to deliver a stable catalytic performance of 17% propylene yield and an inhibition of the over-oxidation of propane.The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide.215 The passivation of defects of oxidized carbon nanotubes with phosphorus (P-oCNTs) may also enhance the C4 olefin selectivity by suppressing combustion for at least 100 h in the ODH of n-butane compared to CNTs and oCNTs.50 Considerable efforts have been made in ODH of light alkane reaction systems over nanostructured carbonaceous catalysts (Scheme 2), such as nanodiamond (ND),216219 graphitic carbons (GC)220224 and other carbons,225227 which enriched the family of metal-free carbon catalyst and expanded the insight of traditional catalysis.Scheme 2 Schematic illustration of the nanostructured carbons:227 (a) multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs); (b) onion-like carbons (OLCs); (c) activated carbon (AC); (d) hexagonally ordered mesoporous carbon with an amorphous framework (CMK-3); (e) hexagonally ordered mesoporous carbon with a Coin-Stacking graphitic framework (CMK-3G); (f) zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC).

3.2 Identification of active sites
Carbon materials have complex surface compositions and structures, and are rich in functional groups, defects and edge sites, making it difficult to establish a clear structureactivity relationship regarding their catalytic performance in ODH of alkanes. In earlier studies, oxygen containing carbonaceous species were proposed to be responsible for their activity in ethylbenzene (EB) ODH.209,228,229 This was verified by characterization of the surface oxygenated groups using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques230 and thermal and chemical treatments of carbonaceous materials,231 from which a linear relationship between the EB conversion rates and the surface concentration of carbonyl/quinone groups based on TPD results (Fig. 14a) was established.231 Fig. 14 Characterization of active sites in the carbon-based ODH catalytic systems: (a) the relation between the activity in the ODH of ethylbenzene and the amounts of carbonyl/quinone groups;231 Reproduced from ref. 231 with permission from the Elsevier Ltd, copyright 1999.

Since the edge sites, defect sites and other oxygenated groups (hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and anhydride groups) of carbon may convert to carbonyl groups in the aerobic environment at increased temperature, it is not straightforward to identify their specific roles and contributions.52,232 To avoid this ambiguity, Qi et al. proposed a chemical titration method (ex situ and in situ) using an analogous organic molecule, i.e. phenylhydrazine, to selectively passivate the specific oxygenated functional groups (ketonic or quinone carbonyl groups) (Fig. 14b). This method provided an intrinsic catalytic activity value (turnover frequency, TOF, based on ketonic carbonyl groups) among various nanocarbon catalysts (GO materials, CNTs and OLCs), revealing that ketonic or quinone carbonyl groups were identical active sites of nanocarbons for an EB ODH reaction.233,234 Moreover, certain polymers were also synthesized to serve as model catalysts, only containing the quinone carbonyl groups, to provide indirect evidence for identifying active sites.235,236 The important role of quinone groups or ketonic groups was also demonstrated in view of their presence on the spent CNFs and OLCs after the EB ODH212,213 and the sharp increase of the ratio of XPS signal strength I(COH)/I(CO) (from 0.72 to 1.87) was observed after switching off the oxygen in the ODH of n-butane (Fig. 14c).50 Besides the studies that supported the significant role of carbonyl/quinone groups in ODH of hydrocarbon,225,235239 there were also opinions52,220,221 that proposed the edge sites and defects of the carbon catalysts as the active sites rather than the quinone-type groups. DFT study on the role of the surface oxygen content, edge sites and defects of a few-layer graphene model suggested that the exposed edges of carbon materials were essential and the dicarbonyls at the zigzag edges and quinones at armchair edges might be responsible for high activity (Fig. 14d).223,224 By means of first-principles calculations, epoxy groups,240 ketone, diketone and quinone groups241 have been evaluated as potential active sites in the ODH of propane. These studies proposed the CH bond breaking of propane as the rate-determining step, and showed the site-dependence of the activity which emphasized the importance of surface modification.240 The progress of the computational studies on the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by nanocarbons has been reviewed and close cooperation between experimental and theoretical studies is expected to further promote the development of ODH reaction systems.242 As mentioned above, the carbonyl/quinone groups could be considered as active sites and a plausible mechanism was proposed that carbonyl/quinone groups could abstract hydrogen atoms from the CH bonds of alkane to form olefin, then gas phase oxygen molecules or dissociated oxygen species react with abstracted hydrogen atoms to form water, involving the regeneration of active sites. A recent review of oxidative dehydrogenation on nanocarbon catalysts from an in situ experimental account stressed that the behavior of O2 or dissociated oxygenated species was still not clear enough to establish a detailed catalytic mechanism of the ODH process from the molecular or atomic level, and more in situ characterizations were required to capture the intermediate species during the activation process of oxygen molecules.53
3.3 Selectivity control of olefins
Generally, the selectivity of styrene is close to 90% in EB ODH reaction over carbonaceous catalysts probably due to the stable π-conjugated structure of styrene which enables it to survive from being further oxidized. Such a conjugated structure is absent in olefins produced in the ODH of light alkanes, and their oxidation produces unwanted COx product under the severe reaction conditions. The ODH of alkanes may be considered to include competitive reactions (Scheme 3) from alkanes to olefins (rate constant of k1) and to COx (k3), and the over-oxidation of alkenes to COx (k2),221,243 in which k1 was usually less than k2 and a maximum olefin yield (35%) could be reached when k1 was equal to k2.243 Scheme 3 The competitive pathways in the ODH of light alkanes.
Typically, the surface oxygen species of nanocarbons are classified into electrophilic (superoxide O2, peroxide O22) and nucleophilic (O2) types.50 Electrophilic oxygen species are electron-deficient and they prefer to attack the electron-rich CC bonds in olefins, which could increase the k2 value, causing the rupture of the carbon skeleton and lowering the selectivity of olefins. In contrast, electron-rich nucleophilic oxygen species, like carbonyl/quinone groups, are selective to convert alkanes to olefins and inactive to catalyze the combustion of olefins during an ODH system. Therefore, limiting the generation of electrophilic oxygen species and maintaining the amount of nucleophilic oxygen species can achieve the target for higher selectivity to olefins.
Heteroatomic (boron, nitrogen and phosphorus elements) doping and modification are often used to modulate the electron density, acidity or basicity and oxygen groups on the surface of nanocarbons. Doping boron atoms into CNTs resulted in an increase of propylene at the cost of decreased reaction rate in the ODH of propane,244 showing that the presence of boron weakened the reactivity of the CNTs. The authors observed active oxygen exchange in dynamic isotope oxygen tracer experiments when using oCNT, which was significantly suppressed when using boron doped oCNT catalysts (Fig. 15a), and concluded that the incorporation of boron could inhibit the generation of peroxide and superoxide species that were responsible for both higher rate of propane conversion and its over-oxidation in the undoped oCNT catalytic system, by which the selectivity of propylene was improved dissociation of molecule oxygen and/or cover the combustion sites to increase the propylene selectivity. Similar phenomena were observed in the borate-modified nanodiamond catalytic system when used for the ODH of propane.219 Fig. 15 Kinetics of propane ODH on carbonaceous catalysts: (a) oxygen exchange on oCNTs (i) and 5B-oCNTs (ii) after switching the gas atmosphere from 2% 16O2/Ne to 2% 18O2/2% Ar/96% Ne;244 Reproduced from ref. 244 with permission from the Wiley-VCH, copyright 2009.

The doping of electron-rich nitrogen element may generate multiple nitrogen species, among which the graphitic nitrogen was shown to play determining roles in the ODH of propane to promote the catalytic activity by reducing the apparent activation energy from 117 kJ mol1 (N-free CNT) to 111 (0.47% surface N) or 106 (0.57%) or 98 (1.44%) kJ mol1 when doped with N, and speeding up the activation of oxygen (Fig. 15b).245 This was confirmed in density functional theory (DFT) calculations which showed that the graphitic nitrogen could lower the barrier to the cleavage of the first CH bond.246 Upon the modification by phosphate,218 nanodiamond behaved similarly as in the B- and N-doped nanodiamond catalytic systems discussed above in their ability to suppress the formation of COx and improve propylene selectivity in the ODH of propane owing to the same reason, i.e. phosphate could react with the phenol groups on the nanodiamond surface and selectively block the defect sites to inhibit the production of electrophilic oxygen species (Fig. 15c).
These above-mentioned nanodiamond catalysts have their surfaces covered by sp2 carbon species. For fresh diamond which was composed of sp3 carbon atoms, fragmented products rather than a dehydrogenated one were formed in the initial stage according to an earlier comparative study of the catalytic transformation of ethylbenzene by sp3-hybridized ultra-dispersed diamond (UDD) and onion-like carbon (OLC), respectively, with benzene formed in the initial stage on the former and styrene formed on the latter.247 The analogous phase-transformation process of carbon from the sp3 to the sp2 hybridization state was also identified in the ODH of n-butane, and the authors proposed that the curved and graphitic surface might be beneficial to generate quinone groups rather than electrophilic oxygenated species, e.g. carboxylic or their anhydrides, resulting in enhanced olefin selectivity.216 The relationship between the quantity of electrophilic oxygen and side reaction rate was revealed using the iodometric titration method in ODH of n-butane, and the selectivity of C4 olefins may be improved by elimination of electrophilic oxygenated species through chemical reduction (LiAlH4 or Grignard reagents) or annealing in nitrogen.248,249 5 Comparison of the ODH catalysts
5.1 Catalytic performance
Table 2 shows the catalytic performance of typical metal-free and metal-based catalysts in ODH reactions. Metal-free carbon-based catalysts usually have lower catalytic activity than metal oxide catalysts, as demonstrated by the lower alkane conversion over the former than over the latter at similar reaction temperature (Table 2), which was attributed to the electronic properties of the center metal ion in the latter. In the ODH of propane, at low reaction temperature (400 C) highly crystalline CNTs and CNFs exhibited relatively high selectivity to propylene (4060%) at low propane conversion level (<5%). CNTs modified with boron or phosphorus oxide could enhance the oxidation resistance at a higher temperature (500 C) with the propylene selectivity maintained (40%) at the 20% conversion level. However, one deficiency that impedes the application of carbon-based catalytic systems is the low productivity of olefins which is always below 1 golefin gcat1 h1, making it hardly profitable for industrialization.Table 2 Catalytic performance of reported catalysts in ODH systems Alkanes Catalysts Temp.

In ODH of propane, boron nitride and silicon boride exhibited approximately 80% selectivity to propylene (90% total selectivity to propylene and ethylene) at 20% propane conversion level with propylene productivity far larger than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 over most boron-based catalysts, showing high potential for industrial implementation. This is in contrast to the relatively low propylene selectivity of less than 50% and low propylene productivity of less than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 in the ODH of propane using metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level.
Over-oxidation of olefin products in ODH is a common problem in the metal oxide and carbonaceous catalytic systems. On metal oxide catalysts, the facile oxidation of olefin products generates a large amount of COx owing to the favorable interaction between metal sites and olefin products, resulting in a sharp decrease in olefin selectivity. As shown in Table 2, the COx could amount to 20%, and even more than 60% at the 20% propane conversion level. In carbon-based catalytic systems, the electron-withdrawing oxygenated groups on the surface of the catalysts may oxidize the electron-rich olefins, causing the rupture of the carbon skeleton to a considerable amount of COx. Surface modification to optimize these surface oxygenated groups via, e.g. surface chemical modifications (B, P) and reduction treatments (annealing, reducing reagents) have been adopted to suppress the production of COx by blocking these surface electrophilic oxygen sites.
In contrast, boron-based catalysts by their nature disfavor the oxidation of olefins as demonstrated in a control experiment39 that no measurable conversion of propylene was detected when the catalysts were fed with C3H6/O2/He under the ODH conditions, and exhibited low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission in the ODH of light alkanes. The total COx selectivity is less than 10% with that of CO2 lower than 1% at ca. 20% propane conversion (Table 2).
The catalytic performance of boron-based catalysts displayed dependence on their composition. In a comparative study,40 several boron-based substances (boron carbide, nickel boride, titanium boride, cobalt boride, elemental boron) showed similar product selectivity in the ODH of propane but differed in the rates of propane consumption, which may be attributed to the difference in their active site density and electronic interactions between the active site and the subsurface bulk structure.
On boron-based catalysts, the selectivity of the target olefin showed dependence on the partial pressure of reactant,203 which is in contrast to that on metal oxide catalysts37 in which the propylene selectivity correlated with the propane conversion but appeared independent on the support materials and the partial pressures of reactants in the ODH of propane. In the ODH of propane on boron-based catalysts, the selectivity of propylene increased with the partial pressure of oxygen and decreased with the propane concentration, e.g. on silicon boride catalysts.203 Similar phenomena were also observed in the ODH of isobutane and n-butane where the product selectivity changed significantly when varying the partial pressure of oxygen over the h-BN catalyst.84 This may be the consequence of the involvement of gas-phase radical reactions in the ODH reaction over boron-based catalysts which can be affected strongly by the composition of the reactants in the gas phase.
5.2 Kinetic behaviors and reaction mechanism
In the metal oxide catalytic systems, the ODH reactions follow the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, encompassing the CH bond activation of alkanes and the oxidation of the reduced center metal by lattice oxygen.36,243,250 It is accepted that the nucleophilic species, including metal bound oxo (MO) sites and bridging oxygen atom between metal centers (MOM), play crucial roles in abstracting the initial hydrogen atom of alkanes to olefins, while the electrophilic species such as metal bound peroxo (M-η2-O2 or MOOM) or superoxo (MO2) are responsible for the deep oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides.82,250,251 The over-oxidation product CO2 amounts to a quite high proportion of the final products, typically more than 20% and in some cases even 60% at the level of 20% propane conversion in ODH reaction.79,252257 Currently the development of precise synthesis methodology258,259 and the understanding of the reaction mechanism205,260,261 are not sufficient to offer a strategy towards acceptable olefin selectivity. There is thus an urgent need to develop applicable catalyst systems to produce olefins with high selectivity and yield under harsh oxidative conditions.
In the boron-based catalytic systems, the reaction orders of propane and dioxygen were measured to be 2 and 0.5, respectively, suggesting the activation and decomposition of dioxygen on the surface.38,39,44,45,48,171 The reported apparent activation energy of propane ranged from 150250 kJ mol1 over boron-based catalysts. On carbon-based catalysts, the reaction order with respect to propane and oxygen were measured to be 0.50.6 and 0.30.4, respectively, and the apparent activation energy of propane was 110 kJ mol1 (Fig. 15b). These intrinsically different kinetic behaviors suggest the different reaction mechanisms on boron-based and carbon-based catalysts.
Similar to that in the metal oxide catalytic system, the activation of the CH bond was considered to be the rate-determining step in both boron- and carbon-based catalytic systems.39,53 On boron-based catalysts, the dehydrogenation did not occur in the pure light alkane atmosphere, implicating that the activation of oxygen or its assistance prior to the cleavage of CH bonds of alkane is required.39,41,45,81 This is not the case on the carbon-based catalysts, and the direct dehydrogenation reaction could proceed in the absence of oxygen, suggesting that the CH bond could be activated by the oxygenated groups on the surface of the catalysts.
The boron- and carbon-based catalytic systems also differ from each other in their major by-products in the ODH of propane, which is the cracking product ethylene in the former while carbon oxides in the latter (Table 2). These results suggest that there is more significant combustion of alkanes or the over-oxidation of olefins on carbon-based catalysts. There are studies207 showing that on boron-based catalysts, the ethylene was produced from the cleavage of CC bonds of propane and the CC coupling of methyl in the gas reaction, and carbon oxides came from the electrophilic oxygenated groups on the surface of carbon-based catalysts.50,218 It is established that in the boron-based catalytic systems, the co-presence of the oxygenated boron sites, gaseous oxygen, and alkane molecule was a prerequisite to fulfill the catalytic reactions. A radical-mediated mechanism was proposed with the reaction initialized at the surface BOH sites by molecular oxygen, leading to the active surface BOOB groups (oxidation step), which then dehydrogenated alkane to produce olefin and water (reduction step). The C1 and C2 products were formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This hypothesis compromised most experimental observations in the h-BN catalytic system reported by various research groups. 6 Summary and perspective The design of catalyst and the engineering of the reactor are two key components to implement the ODH protocol in industry, and the optimal synergy between them governs the success of an implementation. In recent years, the emerging metal-free boron-based catalysts represent promising alternatives for the industrialization of the ODH of light alkanes with superior selectivity toward light olefins and atom economy for valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, and knowledge on both fundamental and application issues is growing. In these studies, the boron-based catalysts displayed remarkable catalyst stability, superior anti-oxidation ability, and excellent thermal conductivity, and offered high productivity to light olefins (>1 golefin gcat1 h1) with established knowledge indicating that the oxygenated boron species at the edge sites or defects are responsible for the triggering of the ODH reaction of light alkanes.
The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN. By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes.
The carbonaceous materials have also shown comparative catalytic performance compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts. In these catalytic systems, it has been accepted that the carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials play important roles in activating alkane molecules. However, owing to their reductivity, the oxidative environment required in the ODH of light alkanes seems to be an obstacle hard to pass through for them, although it may be alleviated via doping of heteroatoms. In addition, the COx emission remained a significant problem due to the low stability and weak resistance against oxidation of carbonaceous materials under aerobic and high-temperature conditions. Their application is further limited by the too low olefin productivity which is below 1 golefin gcat1 h1.
There are remaining issues to address. First, detailed spectroscopic evidence of key intermediates under realistic reaction conditions is rare, which is necessary for a deep understanding of the ODH reaction at the molecular level. And extensive studies are expected to combine theoretical simulations and advanced experimental techniques, e.g. microscopic and spectroscopic methods under operando conditions, to capture the key intermediates. These studies will disclose the key issues regarding the reaction mechanism, e.g. the knowledge on the geometric and electronic characters of boron sites, the transformations of the BO and BOH groups, and the roles of the adjacent structure of oxygen-containing boron sites in the alkane ODH reactions, based on which the structureactivity relationship of the boron-based catalysts in the ODH of light alkanes may be established. Second, extensive efforts are needed to develop advanced structure-tuning strategies for more precise synthesis and functionalization of boron-based materials, and thus to enhance the activity and stability of the ODH catalysts. Previous studies have revealed that hydroxylated boron sites on boron nitride edges are decisive for the specific catalytic activity in the ODH reaction. It is beneficial for making use of this finding to improve the activity of catalysts by means of maximization of the presence of OH-containing boron sites. The third issue concerns the synergy of catalyst design and reactor engineering. The ODH is a strongly exothermic reaction which may release approximately 118 kJ mol1 energy in the ODH of propane. This suggests the potential threat from the presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed, and it is necessary to take strategies to transport timely mass and heat away from the catalyst bed. The choice of a suitable strategy requires knowledge on the behavior of the catalytic system in the reactor and the influencing factors. This calls for the close co-operation of experimental evaluation and theoretical simulation of various recipes of relevant parameters covering the composition and the morphology of the catalysts and the engineering of the reactors. The fluid dynamics simulations have been used to understand the heat flow in the reactor. In order to achieve optimal synergy of the catalyst and the reactor, advanced simulation techniques are expected to be applied to achieve more accurate understanding.In conclusion, the boron-based ODH catalytic systems represent promising choices in industrialization owing to their high catalytic activity and intrinsic properties in suppressing over-oxidation of olefins. The carbon-based ODH catalysts provide a good test bed to extensively understand the mechanistic issues in metal-free ODH catalytic systems. The remaining issues of concern are mainly in three aspects: (1) to develop the in situ characterization and theoretical simulations under realistic reaction conditions to disclose in-depth the reaction mechanism in the boron- and carbon-based ODH catalytic systems; (2) to exploit precise synthesis strategies for promising metal-free catalysts in order to facilitate their application in industrialized ODH processes; and (3) to identify the recipe with an optimal synergy of boron-based catalyst and reactor.
