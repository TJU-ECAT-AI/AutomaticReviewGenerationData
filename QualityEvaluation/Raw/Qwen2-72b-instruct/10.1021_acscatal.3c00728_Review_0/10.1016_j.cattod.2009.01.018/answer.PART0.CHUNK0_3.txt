[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation."
[3] "This alternative process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime thanks to prevention of the coke deposition."
[4] "Furthermore, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic."
[5] "Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
[6] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include lower reaction temperatures, enhanced catalyst lifetime due to the prevention of coke deposition, and the fact that the process is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic. These advantages make it more favorable compared to established processes in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications.
