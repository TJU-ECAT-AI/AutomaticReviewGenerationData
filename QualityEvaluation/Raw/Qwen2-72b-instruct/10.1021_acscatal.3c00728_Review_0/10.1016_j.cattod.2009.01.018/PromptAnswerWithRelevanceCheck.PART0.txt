<quotes>

[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation."
[3] "This alternative process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime thanks to prevention of the coke deposition."
[4] "Furthermore, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic."
[5] "Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
[6] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its increasing demand across various applications. This demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Economically, this approach is advantageous due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime, which prevents coke deposition. Environmentally, the process is not equilibrium-limited or endothermic, giving it important advantages over established processes. The growing world demand for propene has made oxidative dehydrogenation a major challenge for catalysis research and development, attracting significant attention in recent years.
