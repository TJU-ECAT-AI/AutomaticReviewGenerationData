1. The evolving significance of propene in the chemical industry: Drivers of increasing demand, diverse applications, and the emergence of propane dehydrogenation as an economically viable and environmentally friendly production method.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its demand outpacing that of ethylene, particularly in Western Europe \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. This trend has led to the preference for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method, addressing the misalignment between current olefin production and market needs. PDH's economic viability and environmental friendliness are evident in its improved energy efficiency and process simplicity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. To meet the increasing demand, better olefin yields are essential. However, higher exothermic reactions in propane ODH lead to greater energy losses and fixed costs, including CO2 production \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Innovative technologies that combine catalyst performance with process design are key to addressing these challenges \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].

Propene, a vital raw material for high-value-added chemicals and polymers, has seen increased demand due to the chemical industry's expansion \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0\]. Propane dehydrogenation is favored for propene production due to its economic viability and environmental benefits over other methods, making it a preferred choice in meeting the growing needs for this key olefin \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0\].

Propylene, a critical chemical industry feedstock, is predominantly used in thermoplastic polypropylene production, with a global demand exceeding $90 billion \[10.1039/C6CY00078A\]. Three main production methods exist: steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking and FCC are energy-intensive and face issues with coke formation, making them less favorable. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is gaining prominence due to its lower operational costs and environmental benefits \[10.1039/C6CY00078A\]. The exothermic nature of ODH eliminates the need for additional energy, and the availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases enhances sustainability \[10.1039/C6CY00078A\]. Fluidized bed reactors are preferred for ODH due to their temperature control and catalyst regeneration capabilities \[10.1039/C6CY00078A\]. Vanadium-based catalysts are crucial for high propylene yield, providing lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation while minimizing carbon oxide formation \[10.1039/C6CY00078A\].

Propene's demand has surged, outpacing conventional sources like ethane steam crackers and FCCs, leading to the preference for propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103\]. This method offers higher propene yields, reduced energy use, and lower greenhouse gas emissions, making it a sustainable and cost-effective solution for growing needs in plastics, resins, and synthetic rubbers production \[10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103\].

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown, with a global production capacity of 110 million tons \[10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330\]. Traditionally, propene was produced from naphtha cracking. However, the shift to abundant natural gas as a feedstock, specifically ethane, has mainly yielded ethylene, creating a gap in C3 and C4 olefin production. To meet market demand, on-purpose processes like propane dehydrogenation have emerged, offering economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods by producing propene more efficiently and with lower emissions \[10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in propane dehydrogenation, particularly in catalyst design and process optimization, have positioned it as a pivotal technology for meeting the growing demand for propene. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient and selective catalysts, enhancing process design for better energy management, and exploring the integration of renewable energy sources to further reduce the carbon footprint of propene production. The development of novel catalysts that can balance lattice oxygen supply and minimize carbon oxide formation will be crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity. Additionally, the optimization of fluidized bed reactors for temperature control and catalyst regeneration will be essential for maximizing the benefits of oxidative dehydrogenation. The potential for scaling up propane dehydrogenation processes to achieve significant energy savings and impact propene production, considering its high demand and energy-intensive production, presents an exciting avenue for future exploration.
