Propene, a vital petrochemical, has witnessed a surge in significance within the chemical industry, driven by escalating demand and a broadening spectrum of applications. The primary driver of this demand is the expanding global plastics industry, where propene is a key precursor for polypropylene production. Additionally, its use in the manufacturing of a variety of chemicals, including propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and cumene, has further bolstered its importance. The emergence of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method has revolutionized the industry by offering an economically viable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. PDH not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also increases the efficiency of propene production, making it a preferred choice for many chemical manufacturers. This shift towards PDH is expected to continue, as it aligns with global sustainability goals and the industry's push towards cleaner production processes.
