The exothermic nature of ODH eliminates the need for additional energy input, and the abundant availability of propane makes this process more sustainable. Fluidized bed reactors are advantageous for ODH, offering controlled operating conditions and catalyst regeneration, crucial for commercial-scale production. Vanadium-based catalysts enhance efficiency, providing lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation. Designing a catalyst that optimally balances lattice oxygen supply and minimizes carbon oxide formation is key to achieving high propene selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1039/C6CY00078A"},
