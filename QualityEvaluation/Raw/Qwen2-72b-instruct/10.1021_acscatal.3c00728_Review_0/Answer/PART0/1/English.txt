Propylene is a critical feedstock in the chemical industry, with two-thirds of global production used in the manufacture of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The current global demand for propylene exceeds $90 billion. Steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation are the three primary commercial methods for producing propylene. Steam cracking is energy-intensive, accounting for 70% of production costs, and catalytic cracking has issues with coke formation and fouling, requiring frequent plant shutdowns for cleaning. FCC processes generate coke deliberately, which is combusted to provide energy for the endothermic cracking reactions, but this makes the process capital-intensive and expensive for propylene production alone. Catalytic dehydrogenation also faces challenges with coke formation and high energy consumption. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its lower operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The exothermic nature of the ODH reaction eliminates the need for additional energy input, and the availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes this process more sustainable. The key to maximizing the benefits of ODH technology lies in selecting the right reactor, with fluidized bed reactors offering advantages over fixed bed reactors in terms of temperature control, mass transfer, and catalyst regeneration. Vanadium-based catalysts are known for their high efficiency in ODH reactions, providing lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Designing a catalyst that optimally balances lattice oxygen supply and minimizes carbon oxide formation is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity.

Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the potential for higher yields of propene, reduced energy consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional production methods. Propane dehydrogenation can meet the growing needs for propene in various applications, such as the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic rubbers, while offering a more sustainable and cost-effective solution.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved, becoming one of the most important organic feedstocks with a global production capacity of 110 million tons. Traditionally, propene and other light olefins were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. However, in recent years, natural gas has become an abundant resource, making it economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. Unlike naphtha cracking, which produces a wide range of light olefins, ethane cracking mainly produces ethylene, with only small amounts of heavier olefins. This has led to a gap between the production of C3 and C4 olefins and their market demand. To address this, on-purpose processes, primarily non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been implemented industrially to meet the growing demand for propene. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the ability to produce propene more efficiently and with lower emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking methods, making it a preferred production method for meeting the increasing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is recognized as a key platform building block for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for these olefins, particularly propene, has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods such as steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil, which are energy-intensive, produce high CO2 emissions, and have low selectivity towards light olefins. Propane dehydrogenation, using cheap light alkanes from abundant shale gas or natural gas as feedstock, is more environmentally friendly and can achieve high olefin selectivity, making it a suitable method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications.

The prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 is the key scientific challenge that must be overcome. The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include potential energy savings of 45% of the energy consumption, and the potential impact of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) if it could be implemented on a large scale, considering the demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy.

Propylene is a critical feedstock in the chemical industry, with two-thirds of global production used in the manufacture of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The current global demand for propylene exceeds $90 billion. Steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation are the three primary commercial methods for producing propylene. Steam cracking is energy-intensive, accounting for 70% of production costs, and catalytic cracking has issues with coke formation and fouling, requiring frequent plant shutdowns for cleaning. FCC processes generate coke deliberately, which is combusted to provide energy for the endothermic cracking reactions, but this makes the process capital-intensive and expensive for propylene production alone. Catalytic dehydrogenation also faces challenges with coke formation and high energy consumption. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its lower operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The exothermic nature of the ODH reaction eliminates the need for additional energy input, and the availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes this process more sustainable. The key to maximizing the benefits of ODH technology lies in selecting the right reactor, with fluidized bed reactors offering advantages over fixed bed reactors in terms of temperature control, mass transfer, and catalyst regeneration. Vanadium-based catalysts are known for their high efficiency in ODH reactions, providing lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Designing a catalyst that optimally balances lattice oxygen supply and minimizes carbon oxide formation is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity.

Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers). Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive. The economic and environmental advantages of this approach include the potential for higher yields of propene, reduced energy consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional production methods. Propane dehydrogenation can meet the growing needs for propene in various applications, such as the production of plastics, resins, and synthetic rubbers, while offering a more sustainable and cost-effective solution.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved, becoming one of the most important organic feedstocks with a global production capacity of 110 million tons. Traditionally, propene and other light olefins were produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha.
