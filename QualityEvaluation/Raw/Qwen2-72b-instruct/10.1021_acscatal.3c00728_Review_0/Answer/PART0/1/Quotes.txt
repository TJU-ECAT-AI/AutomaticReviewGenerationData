[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
          [2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
          [3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
          [4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
          [7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol.
          With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing.
          Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars.1 There are three major commercial processes available for propylene production, including steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC) and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 The steam cracking process consumes a large amount of energy, which accounts for 70% of the overall production cost. The coke formation during the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules is another drawback of the catalytic cracking process. This causes severe process operational problems, especially fouling, which requires frequent plant shut-downs for cleaning. In the FCC process, the coke generation is deliberate. The formed coke is combusted in a catalyst regenerator producing heat and is supplied back to the catalytic cracking unit using the catalyst as an energy carrier. This energy is essential for the FCC reactor to carry out the endothermic cracking reactions. In the FCC process the propylene is obtained as a by-product, in addition to the lighter gasoline and other fuels. The yield of propylene can be increased by manipulating the FCC operating conditions and using catalyst additives. Recent research shows that the FCC catalysts can also improve the propylene yield about 4.5% to 10%. However, the propylene production cost in the FCC process is still high due to the energy requirement by the endothermic cracking reactions. This high energy demand and the continuous catalyst regeneration make the FCC process capital intensive. Consequently, the building of a FCC system for the sole aim of producing propylene is not economical. The third available technology, catalytic dehydrogenation, also suffers from the problem of coke formation and high energy requirement as a result of the endothermic nature of the reaction.3 Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes.2 Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes.4 However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology.5 Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions. Catalyst deactivation is another problem associated with fixed bed systems. The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems. These include controlled operating conditions at constant temperature, which assist in circumventing the issues with hot spots in fixed bed reactors. The absence of limitations of mass transfer and uniform residence time distributions (RTD) is also a merit of fluidized bed reactors. Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation. This enables a twin reactor set up, one for oxidative dehydrogenation and the other for regeneration of catalyst, which makes this route attractive for commercial scale production.68 In addition to the appropriate reactor selection, the development of suitable catalysts is another key aspect for the commercial implementation of ODH processes. High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst.4 It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons.924 The wisdom behind this is the provision of lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes by vanadium catalysts.2526 The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides. High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene. Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions.27



Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap.

Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates.18 The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins. In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained.



Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2.
          The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx).
          The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation.
          The potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption.
          This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale.

[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."
          [2] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."

[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable."
          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation."
          [3] "This alternative process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime thanks to prevention of the coke deposition."
          [4] "Furthermore, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic."
          [5] "Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
          [6] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

          [5] "Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
          [6] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
          [2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
          [3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
          [4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
          [7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol.
          With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing.
          Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars.1 There are three major commercial processes available for propylene production, including steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC) and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 The steam cracking process consumes a large amount of energy, which accounts for 70% of the overall production cost. The coke formation during the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules is another drawback of the catalytic cracking process. This causes severe process operational problems, especially fouling, which requires frequent plant shut-downs for cleaning. In the FCC process, the coke generation is deliberate. The formed coke is combusted in a catalyst regenerator producing heat and is supplied back to the catalytic cracking unit using the catalyst as an energy carrier. This energy is essential for the FCC reactor to carry out the endothermic cracking reactions. In the FCC process the propylene is obtained as a by-product, in addition to the lighter gasoline and other fuels. The yield of propylene can be increased by manipulating the FCC operating conditions and using catalyst additives. Recent research shows that the FCC catalysts can also improve the propylene yield about 4.5% to 10%. However, the propylene production cost in the FCC process is still high due to the energy requirement by the endothermic cracking reactions. This high energy demand and the continuous catalyst regeneration make the FCC process capital intensive. Consequently, the building of a FCC system for the sole aim of producing propylene is not economical. The third available technology, catalytic dehydrogenation, also suffers from the problem of coke formation and high energy requirement as a result of the endothermic nature of the reaction.3 Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes.2 Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes.4 However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology.5 Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions. Catalyst deactivation is another problem associated with fixed bed systems. The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems. These include controlled operating conditions at constant temperature, which assist in circumventing the issues with hot spots in fixed bed reactors. The absence of limitations of mass transfer and uniform residence time distributions (RTD) is also a merit of fluidized bed reactors. Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation. This enables a twin reactor set up, one for oxidative dehydrogenation and the other for regeneration of catalyst, which makes this route attractive for commercial scale production.68 In addition to the appropriate reactor selection, the development of suitable catalysts is another key aspect for the commercial implementation of ODH processes. High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst.4 It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons.924 The wisdom behind this is the provision of lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes by vanadium catalysts.2526 The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides. High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene. Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions.27



Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap.

Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates.18 The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins. In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained.



Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2.
          The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx).
          The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation.
          The potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption.
          This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale.

[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."
          [2] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."

[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable."
          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation."
          [3] "This alternative process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime thanks to prevention of the coke deposition."
          [4] "Furthermore, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic."
          [5] "Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
          [6] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
          [2] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
          [3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
          [4] "The successful commercial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance characteristics with innovative process designs."
          [5] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
          [6] "This implies that  while in the production of, say, acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH, better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
          [7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol.
          With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing.
          Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars.1 There are three major commercial processes available for propylene production, including steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC) and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 The steam cracking process consumes a large amount of energy, which accounts for 70% of the overall production cost. The coke formation during the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules is another drawback of the catalytic cracking process. This causes severe process operational problems, especially fouling, which requires frequent plant shut-downs for cleaning. In the FCC process, the coke generation is deliberate. The formed coke is combusted in a catalyst regenerator producing heat and is supplied back to the catalytic cracking unit using the catalyst as an energy carrier. This energy is essential for the FCC reactor to carry out the endothermic cracking reactions. In the FCC process the propylene is obtained as a by-product, in addition to the lighter gasoline and other fuels. The yield of propylene can be increased by manipulating the FCC operating conditions and using catalyst additives. Recent research shows that the FCC catalysts can also improve the propylene yield about 4.5% to 10%. However, the propylene production cost in the FCC process is still high due to the energy requirement by the endothermic cracking reactions. This high energy demand and the continuous catalyst regeneration make the FCC process capital intensive. Consequently, the building of a FCC system for the sole aim of producing propylene is not economical. The third available technology, catalytic dehydrogenation, also suffers from the problem of coke formation and high energy requirement as a result of the endothermic nature of the reaction.3 Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes.2 Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes.4 However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology.5 Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions. Catalyst deactivation is another problem associated with fixed bed systems. The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems. These include controlled operating conditions at constant temperature, which assist in circumventing the issues with hot spots in fixed bed reactors. The absence of limitations of mass transfer and uniform residence time distributions (RTD) is also a merit of fluidized bed reactors. Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation. This enables a twin reactor set up, one for oxidative dehydrogenation and the other for regeneration of catalyst, which makes this route attractive for commercial scale production.68 In addition to the appropriate reactor selection, the development of suitable catalysts is another key aspect for the commercial implementation of ODH processes. High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst.4 It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons.924 The wisdom behind this is the provision of lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes by vanadium catalysts.2526 The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides. High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene. Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions.27



Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, on-purpose processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap.

Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates.18 The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins. In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained.



Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2.
          The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx).
          The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to better control this partial oxidation.
          The potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption.
          This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale.

[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."
          [2] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas."
