          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved as it has become a key feedstock for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives. The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it is a more direct and efficient process compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking of heavy oils. Economically, propane dehydrogenation offers higher yields and lower operating costs, making it more attractive for meeting the growing needs for propene. Environmentally, this approach is advantageous as it results in lower carbon emissions and energy consumption, contributing to a more sustainable chemical industry.
