1.The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its high selectivity to the target alkenes and increased supply of natural and shale gas. This approach is economically and environmentally advantageous as it offers an alternative, practical, and environmentally friendly route for the production of light olefins. The use of cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas as feedstock makes this process economically viable. Moreover, the high olefin selectivity obtained from this process meets the growing needs for propene across various applications without the high-energy demands and enormous CO2 emissions associated with traditional routes such as steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

1.丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为这种方法对目标烯烃具有高选择性，并且随着天然气和页岩气供应的增加，经济性和环境优势凸显。这种方法提供了一种替代的、实用的、环境友好的轻烯烃生产路线。使用从丰富的页岩气或天然气中分离出的廉价轻烷烃作为原料，使这一过程在经济上可行。此外，该过程获得的高烯烃选择性满足了各种应用中对丙烯日益增长的需求，而无需像传统的原油裂解和重油流化催化裂化路线那样消耗大量能源和产生大量二氧化碳排放。
