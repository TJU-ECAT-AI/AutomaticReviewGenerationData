[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates.18 The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins. In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is recognized as a key platform building block for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for these olefins, particularly propene, has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods such as steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil, which are energy-intensive, produce high CO2 emissions, and have low selectivity towards light olefins. Propane dehydrogenation, using cheap light alkanes from abundant shale gas or natural gas as feedstock, is more environmentally friendly and can achieve high olefin selectivity, making it a suitable method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications.

1.丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经演变，因为它被公认为是生产增值聚合物、含氧化合物和重要化学中间体的关键平台构建块。特别是丙烯，这些烯烃需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。这种方法在经济和环境方面优于传统的蒸汽裂解原油衍生石脑油和流化催化裂解重油的方法，后者能耗高，产生大量二氧化碳排放，并且对轻烯烃的选择性低。使用来自丰富页岩气或天然气的廉价轻烷烃作为原料的丙烷脱氢更加环保，可以实现高烯烃选择性，使其成为满足丙烯在各种应用中日益增长需求的合适方法。
