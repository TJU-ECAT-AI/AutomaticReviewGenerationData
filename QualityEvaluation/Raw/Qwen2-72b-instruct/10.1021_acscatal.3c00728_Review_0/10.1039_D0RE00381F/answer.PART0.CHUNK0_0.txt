1.The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its high selectivity to the target alkenes and increased supply of natural and shale gas. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages by utilizing cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas as the feedstock, resulting in high olefin selectivity at high temperature (400750 C) without the need for oxygen, which makes it difficult to control the selectivity to the target olefins. Metal-based catalysts, particularly Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their excellent activity and high selectivity to olefins.

1.丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为这种方法对目标烯烃具有高选择性，并且随着天然气和页岩气的供应增加。这种方法通过利用从丰富的页岩气或天然气中分离出的廉价轻烷作为原料，提供了经济和环境优势，在高温（400750°C）下实现了高烯烃选择性，而无需氧气，这使得很难控制对目标烯烃的选择性。金属基催化剂，特别是Pt基双金属催化剂，由于其优异的活性和对烯烃的高选择性，已被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。
