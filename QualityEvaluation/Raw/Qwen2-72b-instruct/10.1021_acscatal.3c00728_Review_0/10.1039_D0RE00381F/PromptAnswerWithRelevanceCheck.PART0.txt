1.The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its high selectivity to the target alkenes and increased supply of natural and shale gas. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages by utilizing cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas as the feedstock, resulting in high olefin selectivity at high temperature (400750 C) without the need for oxygen, which makes it difficult to control the selectivity to the target olefins. Metal-based catalysts, particularly Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their excellent activity and high selectivity to olefins.

[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates.18 The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins. In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

1.The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as it is recognized as a key platform building block for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for these olefins, particularly propene, has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods such as steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil, which are energy-intensive, produce high CO2 emissions, and have low selectivity towards light olefins. Propane dehydrogenation, using cheap light alkanes from abundant shale gas or natural gas as feedstock, is more environmentally friendly and can achieve high olefin selectivity, making it a suitable method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications.
