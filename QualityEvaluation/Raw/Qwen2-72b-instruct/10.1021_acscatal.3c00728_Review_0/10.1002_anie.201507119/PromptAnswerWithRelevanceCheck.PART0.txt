1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to answer the question about the significance of propene in the chemical industry, its evolving role, and the advantages of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it can be inferred that propene is a significant product in the chemical industry due to its high demand, and propane dehydrogenation is an economically and environmentally favorable method for its production compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which is energy-intensive and produces large amounts of CO2 emissions.

1.在提供的文献中没有找到与丙烯在化工行业的重要性、其角色的演变以及丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的优势相关的问题的适用引文。但是，可以推断出丙烯是化工行业的重要产品，由于其需求量大，与传统的热裂解或催化裂解石油衍生石脑油相比，丙烷脱氢是一种经济和环境上更有利的生产方法，后者能源密集且产生大量二氧化碳排放。
