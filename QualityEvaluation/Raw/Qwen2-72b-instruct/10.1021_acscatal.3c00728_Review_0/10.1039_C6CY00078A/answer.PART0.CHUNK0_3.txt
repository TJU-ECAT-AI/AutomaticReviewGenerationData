[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars.1 There are three major commercial processes available for propylene production, including steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC) and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 The steam cracking process consumes a large amount of energy, which accounts for 70% of the overall production cost. The coke formation during the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules is another drawback of the catalytic cracking process. This causes severe process operational problems, especially fouling, which requires frequent plant shut-downs for cleaning. In the FCC process, the coke generation is deliberate. The formed coke is combusted in a catalyst regenerator producing heat and is supplied back to the catalytic cracking unit using the catalyst as an energy carrier. This energy is essential for the FCC reactor to carry out the endothermic cracking reactions. In the FCC process the propylene is obtained as a by-product, in addition to the lighter gasoline and other fuels. The yield of propylene can be increased by manipulating the FCC operating conditions and using catalyst additives. Recent research shows that the FCC catalysts can also improve the propylene yield about 4.5% to 10%. However, the propylene production cost in the FCC process is still high due to the energy requirement by the endothermic cracking reactions. This high energy demand and the continuous catalyst regeneration make the FCC process capital intensive. Consequently, the building of a FCC system for the sole aim of producing propylene is not economical. The third available technology, catalytic dehydrogenation, also suffers from the problem of coke formation and high energy requirement as a result of the endothermic nature of the reaction.3 Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes.2 Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes.4 However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology.5 Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions. Catalyst deactivation is another problem associated with fixed bed systems. The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems. These include controlled operating conditions at constant temperature, which assist in circumventing the issues with hot spots in fixed bed reactors. The absence of limitations of mass transfer and uniform residence time distributions (RTD) is also a merit of fluidized bed reactors. Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation. This enables a twin reactor set up, one for oxidative dehydrogenation and the other for regeneration of catalyst, which makes this route attractive for commercial scale production.68 In addition to the appropriate reactor selection, the development of suitable catalysts is another key aspect for the commercial implementation of ODH processes. High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst.4 It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons.924 The wisdom behind this is the provision of lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes by vanadium catalysts.2526 The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides. High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene. Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions.27"

1.Propylene is a critical feedstock in the chemical industry, with two-thirds of global production used in the manufacture of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The current global demand for propylene exceeds $90 billion. Steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation are the three primary commercial methods for producing propylene. Steam cracking is energy-intensive, accounting for 70% of production costs, and catalytic cracking has issues with coke formation and fouling, requiring frequent plant shutdowns for cleaning. FCC processes generate coke deliberately, which is combusted to provide energy for the endothermic cracking reactions, but this makes the process capital-intensive and expensive for propylene production alone. Catalytic dehydrogenation also faces challenges with coke formation and high energy consumption. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its lower operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The exothermic nature of the ODH reaction eliminates the need for additional energy input, and the availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes this process more sustainable. The key to maximizing the benefits of ODH technology lies in selecting the right reactor, with fluidized bed reactors offering advantages over fixed bed reactors in terms of temperature control, mass transfer, and catalyst regeneration. Vanadium-based catalysts are known for their high efficiency in ODH reactions, providing lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Designing a catalyst that optimally balances lattice oxygen supply and minimizes carbon oxide formation is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity.

1.丙烯是化工行业的重要原料，全球生产的三分之二用于生产热塑性聚丙烯，这是一种广泛应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜和其他应用的化合物。目前全球丙烯的销售额和需求超过900亿美元。生产丙烯的三种主要商业方法包括蒸汽裂解、催化裂化（FCC）和催化脱氢。蒸汽裂解消耗大量能源，占总生产成本的70%，而催化裂化在重烃分子裂解过程中会产生焦炭，这会导致严重的工艺操作问题，尤其是积垢，需要频繁的工厂停工进行清洁。在FCC过程中，焦炭的生成是故意的。形成的焦炭在催化剂再生器中燃烧产生热量，并使用催化剂作为能量载体返回催化裂化单元。这种能量对于FCC反应器执行吸热裂解反应至关重要。在FCC过程中，丙烯作为副产品获得，除了较轻的汽油和其他燃料。通过操纵FCC操作条件和使用催化剂添加剂，可以增加丙烯的产量。最近的研究表明，FCC催化剂也可以将丙烯产量提高约4.5%至10%。然而，由于吸热裂解反应所需的能量需求，FCC过程中的丙烯生产成本仍然很高。这种高能量需求和连续的催化剂再生使得FCC过程资本密集型。因此，仅以生产丙烯为目的建立FCC系统在经济上并不划算。第三种可用的技术，催化脱氢，也面临着焦炭形成和高能量需求的问题，这是由于反应的吸热性质。与上述商业过程相反，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）到丙烯更具吸引力，因为它具有较低的运营成本和最小的环境影响。丙烷在天然气和炼油厂废气中的丰富可用性可以使通过丙烷ODH生产丙烯比传统过程更具可持续性。其最重要的优势是反应的放热性质，不需要额外的能量来加速反应。ODH的副产品水的形成使得可以避免在非氧化路线中观察到的热力学约束。然而，选择合适的反应器是实现ODH技术上述优势的关键因素。固定床反应器简单，但在等温条件下难以操作。催化剂失活是固定床系统存在的另一个问题。流化床反应器与传统的固定反应器系统相比具有许多优势。这些包括在恒定温度下控制操作条件，这有助于避免固定床反应器中的热点问题。不存在质量传递的限制和均匀的停留时间分布（RTD）也是流化床反应器的优点。此外，从氧化脱氢单元到再生单元运输还原的催化物种也是流化床反应器的优点之一，它允许周期性催化剂再氧化。这使得可以建立双反应器设置，一个用于氧化脱氢，另一个用于催化剂再生，这使得该路线对商业规模生产具有吸引力。除了选择合适的反应器外，开发合适的催化剂是实施ODH过程的另一个关键方面。通过使用高效的催化剂可以获得高产率的丙烯。文献报道，基于钒的催化剂为轻烃的ODH提供了最高的烷烃转化率和烯烃选择性。其背后的智慧是钒催化剂为烷烃脱氢提供了晶格氧。丙烷氧化涉及的反应包括所需的丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯以及丙烷和产生的丙烯燃烧到碳氧化物。只有在较低的丙烷转化率下，丙烯的选择性才是有利的，因为与丙烯相比，丙烷的反应性较低。因此，需要设计一种催化剂，以提供最佳水平的晶格氧，以选择性地产生丙烯，同时通过初级/次级燃烧将碳氧化物降至最低。
