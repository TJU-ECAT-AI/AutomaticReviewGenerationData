[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

[3] "Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes."

1. Propylene is a crucial feedstock in the chemical industry, with two-thirds of global production used in the manufacture of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The current global demand for propylene exceeds $90 billion. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is gaining popularity due to its low operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The abundant supply of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes propylene production via ODH more sustainable than traditional methods. A key advantage of ODH is its exothermic nature, eliminating the need for additional energy to drive the reaction. The by-product of water in ODH avoids the thermodynamic constraints seen in non-oxidative processes.

1. 丙烯是化工行业的重要原料，全球生产的三分之二用于生产热塑性聚丙烯，这是一种广泛应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜等领域的化合物。目前全球丙烯需求超过900亿美元。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）制丙烯因其低运营成本和最小的环境影响而越来越受欢迎。天然气和炼油厂废气中丙烷的丰富供应使ODH制丙烯比传统方法更具可持续性。ODH的一个关键优势是其放热性质，无需额外能量来推动反应。ODH中的水副产品避免了非氧化途径中观察到的热力学约束。
