[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

[3] "Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes."

1. Propylene is a crucial feedstock in the chemical industry, with two-thirds of global production used in the manufacture of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The global demand for propylene is currently over ninety billion dollars. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is gaining popularity due to its lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact. The abundant supply of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes ODH propane a more sustainable method of propylene production compared to traditional processes. A key advantage of ODH is its exothermic nature, which does not require additional energy to initiate the reaction. The by-product of water in the ODH process helps avoid thermodynamic constraints seen in non-oxidative routes.

1. 丙烯是化工行业的重要原料，全球约三分之二的丙烯用于生产热塑性聚丙烯，这是一种广泛应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜等领域的化合物。目前全球丙烯的销售需求已超过900亿美元。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）制丙烯因其较低的运营成本和较小的环境影响而受到青睐。在天然气和炼油厂废气中丙烷的丰富供应，使得ODH丙烷制丙烯相比传统工艺更为可持续。ODH的一个关键优势是其放热性质，不需要额外的能量来启动反应。ODH过程中产生的水副产品有助于避免非氧化路线中出现的热力学约束。
