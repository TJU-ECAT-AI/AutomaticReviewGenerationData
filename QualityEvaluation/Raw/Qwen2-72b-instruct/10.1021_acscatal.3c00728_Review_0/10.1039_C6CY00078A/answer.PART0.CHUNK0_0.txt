[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars.1 There are three major commercial processes available for propylene production, including steam cracking, catalytic cracking (FCC) and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 The steam cracking process consumes a large amount of energy, which accounts for 70% of the overall production cost. The coke formation during the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules is another drawback of the catalytic cracking process. This causes severe process operational problems, especially fouling, which requires frequent plant shut-downs for cleaning. In the FCC process, the coke generation is deliberate. The formed coke is combusted in a catalyst regenerator producing heat and is supplied back to the catalytic cracking unit using the catalyst as an energy carrier. This energy is essential for the FCC reactor to carry out the endothermic cracking reactions. In the FCC process the propylene is obtained as a by-product, in addition to the lighter gasoline and other fuels. The yield of propylene can be increased by manipulating the FCC operating conditions and using catalyst additives. Recent research shows that the FCC catalysts can also improve the propylene yield about 4.5% to 10%. However, the propylene production cost in the FCC process is still high due to the energy requirement by the endothermic cracking reactions. This high energy demand and the continuous catalyst regeneration make the FCC process capital intensive. Consequently, the building of a FCC system for the sole aim of producing propylene is not economical. The third available technology, catalytic dehydrogenation, also suffers from the problem of coke formation and high energy requirement as a result of the endothermic nature of the reaction.3 Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes.2 Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction. The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes.4 However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology.5 Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions. Catalyst deactivation is another problem associated with fixed bed systems. The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems. These include controlled operating conditions at constant temperature, which assist in circumventing the issues with hot spots in fixed bed reactors. The absence of limitations of mass transfer and uniform residence time distributions (RTD) is also a merit of fluidized bed reactors. Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation. This enables a twin reactor set up, one for oxidative dehydrogenation and the other for regeneration of catalyst, which makes this route attractive for commercial scale production.68 In addition to the appropriate reactor selection, the development of suitable catalysts is another key aspect for the commercial implementation of ODH processes. High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst.4 It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons.924 The wisdom behind this is the provision of lattice oxygen for dehydrogenation of alkanes by vanadium catalysts.2526 The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides. High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene. Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions.27 In vanadium-based catalysts, the activity and propylene selectivity are directly related to the structure of VOx surface species. The performance of the catalyst can be enhanced by controlling its redox properties, morphology of surface species of VOx and acidbase characteristics.2830 The surface density of VOx increases with vanadium loading, which is the lowest for monovanadate isolated VOx species and the highest for monolayer coverage species. Catalyst activity and reducibility increases as surface density of VOx increases while its selectivity decreases as the surface density of VOx increases.3135 Adjustments of the coordination and environment of the species of VOx can influence the catalytic behavior. The acidbase character of VOx catalyst supports has been found to have influence on propylene selectivity in ODH.4 Propane adsorption and propylene desorption are functions of the acidbase properties of the support. Adsorption of a basic reactant and desorption of an acidic product are functions of the acidity of the catalyst. The acidity of the catalyst determines the protection of these chemical species from oxidizing to carbon oxides.36 The acidic character of alkanes and their corresponding olefins diminishes with increased carbon number and degree of molecule saturation; one can hypothesize that a higher selectivity in ODH could be achieved by designing catalysts with a controlled acidic character.37,38 There are usually strong interactions between the support (carrier) and the active site (VOx). Gamma aluminum oxide is not inert towards VOx. Its interaction towards the VOx phase is not weak, hence it results in a very high dispersion of V2O5 on its surface. High vanadium loading can be achieved on γ-Al2O3, but resulting samples will show lower surface areas unlike CaO, which has a higher surface area. The use of CaO will improve a resulting catalyst's superficial area and also gives it the desired moderate level of acidity, that will maximize propane adsorption and propylene desorption and also minimize propylene and propane combustion. Hence, the synthesis of mixed γ-Al2O3/CaO supports is an interesting route to achieve catalyst samples with high dispersion of the surface active species, and a surface area that is higher than that of γ-Al2O3.39 Based on the above discussion, the present work is aimed at developing fluidizable vanadium oxide catalysts using a mixed γ-Al2O3CaO with different γ-Al2O3/CaO ratios as support. The prepared catalysts were characterized using various physicochemical characterization techniques (XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, TPD, TRP/TPO, SEM-EDXS) to determine the desired catalyst properties. The performance of the developed catalysts on the ODH of propane was evaluated in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator under gas phase oxygen free conditions. In this approach, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished with the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. The major advantage of this process is the possibility of achieving higher propylene selectivity by appropriate control of the lattice oxygen of the catalysts."
