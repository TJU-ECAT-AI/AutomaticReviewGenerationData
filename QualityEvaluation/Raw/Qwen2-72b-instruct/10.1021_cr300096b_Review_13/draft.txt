1. The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, for hydrogenation reactions, attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, and its implications for first-principles catalyst design.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, is the main reason for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/cr300096b_13\]. This stability under both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment and hydrogenation reaction conditions allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The implication of this correlation is that it allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, as the model surfaces accurately predict the behavior of the supported catalysts under reaction conditions. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, underlies the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the bimetallic structures remain intact under reaction conditions, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity. The implication of this correlation is that by understanding and designing these stable bimetallic structures on model surfaces, it becomes possible to rationally design more effective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions using first principles.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, for hydrogenation reactions, attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, opens up new avenues for catalyst design. Future research might focus on the exploration of alternative bimetallic systems with similar thermodynamic stability, aiming to reduce the cost and increase the thermal stability of catalysts. The understanding of electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and their stability on different substrates can guide the design of more effective catalysts. The potential replacement of Pt with materials like WC in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability, is a promising direction for future research.
