1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature to answer the question about the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The literature does not discuss the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.
