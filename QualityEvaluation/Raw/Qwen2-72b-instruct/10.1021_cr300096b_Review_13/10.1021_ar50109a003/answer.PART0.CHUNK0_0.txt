1.The literature does not provide specific quotes regarding the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention the importance of understanding the structure and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles for catalysis, which can imply that the stability of these structures plays a role in their catalytic activity. This understanding can aid in the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

1.文献没有提供关于Pt-3d系统中具有次表面3d原子的双金属结构的热力学稳定性及其对模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中相关性贡献的具体引用。但是，它确实提到了理解双金属纳米颗粒的结构和组成对于催化作用的重要性，这可能意味着这些结构的稳定性对其催化活性有影响。这种理解可以有助于使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂。
