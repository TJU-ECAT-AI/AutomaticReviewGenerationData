1.The literature does not provide specific information on the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, nor does it discuss the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the subsurface configuration of the Ni/Pt(111) monolayer bimetallic system, PtNiPt(111), displays a unique low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The origin of this unique pathway was correlated to the low binding energy of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) that was weaker than on either of the parent metal surfaces. This suggests that the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures can contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are that by understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, researchers can predict the catalytic activity of these surfaces and design catalysts with desired properties. For example, the literature discusses the replacement of Pt in Ni/Pt bimetallic systems with WC as less expensive and more stable catalysts. The main body of the review consists of a literature review of metal-modified carbides utilized for catalytic and electrocatalytic studies. Examples are provided to illustrate the general trends and properties of metal-modified carbides. Finally, trends from these examples are used as a basis to discuss future opportunities for further understanding and applications of metal-modified carbides.

1.文献没有提供关于Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，以及模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的相关性的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，Ni/Pt(111)单层双金属系统的亚表面配置，即PtNiPt(111)，显示出一种独特的低温氢化途径，这种途径在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上并不存在。这种独特途径的起源与PtNiPt(111)上环己烯的低结合能有关，这种结合能比任一母金属表面的结合能都弱。这表明，特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性可以对模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的相关性产生影响。这种相关性对使用第一性原理在模型表面上设计更有效的催化剂的影响是，通过理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质，研究人员可以预测这些表面的催化活性，并设计具有所需性质的催化剂。例如，文献讨论了用WC代替Ni/Pt双金属系统中的Pt，作为成本更低、稳定性更高的催化剂。评论的主体部分是对用于催化和电催化研究的金属改性碳化物的文献综述。提供了示例来说明金属改性碳化物的一般趋势和性质。最后，从这些示例中得出的趋势被用作进一步理解和应用金属改性碳化物的未来机会的基础。

1.The literature does not provide specific information on the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, and that the structure with admetal on the top-most layer, designated as 3d-Pt(111), moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, while the structure with admetal in the subsurface region, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. The surface structure binds adsorbates strongly and is effective for decomposition reactions, while the subsurface structure has a weak adsorbate binding energy and is active for hydrogenation. The literature also discusses the stability of metal overlayers on different substrates, with carbides being a better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are not explicitly stated in the literature, but it can be inferred that understanding the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and their stability on different substrates can guide the design of more effective catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属结构,特别是Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的结构的热力学稳定性,及其对模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的相关性贡献的具体信息。但是,它确实提到双金属表面的电子和催化性质取决于吸附金属的位置,并且顶部层具有吸附金属的结构,标记为3d-Pt(111),将d带中心移近费米能级,而具有吸附金属在亚表面区域的结构,标记为Pt-3d-Pt(111),将d带中心移离费米能级。d带中心与吸附物结合能有很好的相关性,因此与催化和电催化活性相关。表面结构强烈结合吸附物,对分解反应有效,而亚表面结构具有弱的吸附物结合能,对氢化有效。文献还讨论了不同基底上金属覆盖层的稳定性,与Pt相比,碳化物是吸附金属更好的扩散屏障。Pt和WC的相似电子和化学性质表明WC可以潜在地替代Pt中的双金属系统,产生成本更低、热稳定性更高的替代双金属催化剂。这种相关性对使用模型表面上的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂的影响在文献中没有明确说明,但可以推断理解双金属表面的电子和催化性质及其在不同基底上的稳定性可以指导更有效催化剂的设计。

The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are that understanding the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces can guide the design of catalysts with desired catalytic properties. By controlling the admetal location and the electronic structure of the bimetallic surface, it is possible to tune the adsorbate binding energy and thus the catalytic activity. The stability of the bimetallic structure under reaction conditions is also crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity over time. By using stable supports such as carbides, it is possible to prevent the diffusion of admetals into the bulk and maintain the desired bimetallic structure.
