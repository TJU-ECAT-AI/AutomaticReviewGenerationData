1.The literature does not provide specific information on the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, and that the structure with admetal on the top-most layer, designated as 3d-Pt(111), moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, while the structure with admetal in the subsurface region, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. The surface structure binds adsorbates strongly and is effective for decomposition reactions, while the subsurface structure has a weak adsorbate binding energy and is active for hydrogenation. The literature also discusses the stability of metal overlayers on different substrates, with carbides being a better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are not explicitly stated in the literature, but it can be inferred that understanding the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and their stability on different substrates can guide the design of more effective catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属结构,特别是Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的结构的热力学稳定性,及其对模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的相关性贡献的具体信息。但是,它确实提到双金属表面的电子和催化性质取决于吸附金属的位置,并且顶部层具有吸附金属的结构,标记为3d-Pt(111),将d带中心移近费米能级,而具有吸附金属在亚表面区域的结构,标记为Pt-3d-Pt(111),将d带中心移离费米能级。d带中心与吸附物结合能有很好的相关性,因此与催化和电催化活性相关。表面结构强烈结合吸附物,对分解反应有效,而亚表面结构具有弱的吸附物结合能,对氢化有效。文献还讨论了不同基底上金属覆盖层的稳定性,与Pt相比,碳化物是吸附金属更好的扩散屏障。Pt和WC的相似电子和化学性质表明WC可以潜在地替代Pt中的双金属系统,产生成本更低、热稳定性更高的替代双金属催化剂。这种相关性对使用模型表面上的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂的影响在文献中没有明确说明,但可以推断理解双金属表面的电子和催化性质及其在不同基底上的稳定性可以指导更有效催化剂的设计。
