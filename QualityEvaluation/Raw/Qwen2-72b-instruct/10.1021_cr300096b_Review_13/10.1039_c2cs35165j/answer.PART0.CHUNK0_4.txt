1.The literature does not provide specific information on the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, and that the structure with admetal on the top-most layer, designated as 3d-Pt(111), moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, while the structure with admetal in the subsurface region, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. The surface structure binds adsorbates strongly and is effective for decomposition reactions, while the subsurface structure has a weak adsorbate binding energy and is active for hydrogenation. The literature also discusses the stability of metal overlayers on different substrates, with carbides being more stable supports for admetals than Pt due to their superior diffusion barrier properties. This stability is crucial for maintaining the desired bimetallic structure under reaction conditions, which can contribute to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are that by understanding the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces on model substrates, researchers can predict the behavior of supported catalysts and optimize their design for specific reactions, such as hydrogenation.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属结构，特别是Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的结构的热力学稳定性及其对模型表面与支持催化剂在氢化反应中相关性贡献的具体信息。但是，它确实提到双金属表面的电子和催化性质取决于吸附金属的位置，顶部层具有3d金属的结构，标记为3d-Pt(111)，将d带中心移近费米能级，而具有亚表面3d金属的结构，标记为Pt-3d-Pt(111)，将d带中心远离费米能级。d带中心与吸附物结合能有很好的相关性，因此与催化和电催化活性相关。表面结构强烈结合吸附物，对分解反应有效，而亚表面结构具有弱的吸附物结合能，对氢化反应活性。文献还讨论了不同基底上金属覆盖层的稳定性，与Pt相比，碳化物是更稳定的吸附金属支持物，因为它们具有优越的扩散屏障性能。这种稳定性对于在反应条件下保持所需的双金属结构至关重要，这可以促进模型表面与支持催化剂之间的相关性。这种相关性对使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效的催化剂的影响是，通过理解模型基底上双金属表面的电子和催化性质，研究人员可以预测支持催化剂的行为并优化其设计以进行特定反应，如氢化反应。
