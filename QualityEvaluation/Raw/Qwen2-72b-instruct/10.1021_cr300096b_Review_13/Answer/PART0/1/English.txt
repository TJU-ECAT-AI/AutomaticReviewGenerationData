The literature does not provide specific quotes regarding the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and its contribution to the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention the importance of understanding the structure and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles for catalysis, which can imply that the stability of these structures plays a role in their catalytic activity. This understanding can aid in the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, is the main reason for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability under both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment and hydrogenation reaction conditions allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. This correlation implies that designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces is promising. This stability ensures that the desirable bimetallic structures are maintained under both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and during hydrogenation reactions. The implication of this correlation is that it allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, as the model surfaces accurately predict the behavior of the supported catalysts under reaction conditions. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, underlies the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the bimetallic structures remain intact under reaction conditions, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity. The implication of this correlation is that by understanding and designing these stable bimetallic structures on model surfaces, it becomes possible to rationally design more effective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions using first principles.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This is evidenced by the unique low-temperature hydrogenation pathway displayed by the subsurface configuration of the Ni/Pt(111) monolayer bimetallic system, PtNiPt(111), which is not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The origin of this pathway is correlated to the low binding energy of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111), which is weaker than on either of the parent metal surfaces. The electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, with the structure having admetal on the top-most layer, designated as 3d-Pt(111), moving the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, while the structure with admetal in the subsurface region, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. The surface structure binds adsorbates strongly and is effective for decomposition reactions, while the subsurface structure has a weak adsorbate binding energy and is active for hydrogenation. The stability of metal overlayers on different substrates is also discussed, with carbides being a better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability. Understanding the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces and their stability on different substrates can guide the design of more effective catalysts.
