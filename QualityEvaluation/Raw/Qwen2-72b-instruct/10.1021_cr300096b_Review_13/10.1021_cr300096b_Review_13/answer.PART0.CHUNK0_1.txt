[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

1.The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, is the main reason for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces is promising.

1.特定的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有表面下3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，是氢化反应中模型表面和支撑催化剂之间存在强相关性的主要原因。这种相关性意味着在模型表面上使用第一原理设计更有效的催化剂是很有希望的。
