[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

1.The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, underlies the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the bimetallic structures remain intact under reaction conditions, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity. The implication of this correlation is that by understanding and designing these stable bimetallic structures on model surfaces, it becomes possible to rationally design more effective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions using first principles.

1.特定的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有表面Pt层下3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，是氢化反应中模型表面和支撑催化剂之间强相关性的主要原因。这种稳定性确保了双金属结构在反应条件下保持完整，这对于维持催化活性至关重要。这种相关性的含义是，通过理解和在模型表面上设计这些稳定的双金属结构，可以使用第一原理合理设计更有效的氢化反应催化剂。
