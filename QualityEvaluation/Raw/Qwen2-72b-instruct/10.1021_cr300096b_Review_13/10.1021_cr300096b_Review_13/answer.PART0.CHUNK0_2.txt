[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

1.The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, is the main reason for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desirable bimetallic structures are maintained under both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and during hydrogenation reactions. The implication of this correlation is that it allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, as the model surfaces accurately predict the behavior of the supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

1.特定的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在具有表面Pt层下3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，是氢化反应中模型表面和支撑催化剂之间存在强相关性的主要原因。这种稳定性确保了在超高真空(UHV)环境和氢化反应条件下，理想的双金属结构得以保持。这种相关性的含义是，它允许使用模型表面上的第一原理来设计更有效的催化剂，因为模型表面可以准确预测反应条件下支撑催化剂的行为。
