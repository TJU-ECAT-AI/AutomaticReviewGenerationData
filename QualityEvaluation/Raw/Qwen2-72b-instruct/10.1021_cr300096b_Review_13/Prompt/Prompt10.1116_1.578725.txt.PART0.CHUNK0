I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

https://doi.org/10.1116/1.578725 Article history Share Tools Tungsten and tungstencarbon thin films have been produced from a W target sputtered in argon and argonmethane mixtures, respectively. The deposition rate of W films was measured as a function of the sputtering power and argon pressure varying in the range of 0.33 Pa. The crystallographic structure and composition of W films deposited on silicon and carbon substrates were investigated by xray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The electrical resistivity of the W films was minimum (12 μΩcm) when the internal stresses in the films were negligible. The carbon concentration in the WC films determined by nuclear reaction analyses and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy was varied from 10 to 95 at.% with increasing CH4 content in the gas phase. The crystallographic structure of the WC films was found to be dependent on the carbon concentration. Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films was that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter. For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappeared and the structure was that of the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase. The structure of WC films with a carbon content greater than 65 at.% was nearly amorphous. Internal stresses and electrical resistivity of WC films were determined as functions of the carbon concentration. The experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress level are reported in this article.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
