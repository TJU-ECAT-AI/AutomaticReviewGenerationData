The intimate relationship between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, notably Pt-3d materials, plays a pivotal role in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation is underpinned by the thermodynamic stability of certain bimetallic configurations, which significantly influences their catalytic performance. The discovery that specific structures exhibit enhanced stability and, consequently, superior catalytic activity has profound implications for the field of first-principles catalyst design. By leveraging computational methods to predict and engineer these stable bimetallic interfaces, researchers can tailor catalysts with optimized properties for hydrogenation processes. This approach not only accelerates the development of more efficient catalysts but also deepens our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing bimetallic catalysis.
