Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?

1.The document does not provide information on the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, or its contribution to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. Therefore, the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces cannot be determined from the given literature.

1.文档没有提供关于特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性（特别是在具有次表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统中）或其对模型表面和氢化反应中支撑催化剂之间的强相关性的贡献的信息。因此，无法从给定文献中确定这种相关性对使用模型表面上的第一性原理设计更有效催化剂的影响。
