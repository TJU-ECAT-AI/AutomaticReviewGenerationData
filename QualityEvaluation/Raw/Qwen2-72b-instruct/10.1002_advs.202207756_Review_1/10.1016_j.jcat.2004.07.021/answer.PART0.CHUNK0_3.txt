1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly stated in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention that the state of gallium in these catalysts has not been fully elucidated yet. Various studies show that only a small part of the protons is substituted by gallium ions upon calcination of catalysts prepared by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation. Instead, gallium is mostly present as small oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite micrograins. To increase the extent of proton substitution by gallium, such zeolites can be reduced in a hydrogen or hydrocarbon atmosphere at elevated temperatures, i.e., around 773 K. These treatments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the state of gallium under reaction conditions, which can advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在提供的文献中，没有明确说明在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的表征主要挑战。然而，文献确实提到，这些催化剂中镓的状态尚未完全阐明。各种研究表明，在通过离子交换或初始湿性浸渍制备的催化剂的煅烧过程中，只有少量的质子被镓离子取代。相反，镓主要以小氧化物颗粒的形式存在于沸石微粒的外表面。为了增加质子被镓取代的程度，这些沸石可以在高温(约773 K)下的氢气或烃类气氛中还原。这些处理促进了还原的镓物种迁移到沸石颗粒的微孔中，导致酸质子的更完全取代。原位或在线表征技术通过在反应条件下提供关于镓状态的实时信息，有助于克服这些挑战，从而推进我们对这些催化体系中结构-活性关系的理解。
