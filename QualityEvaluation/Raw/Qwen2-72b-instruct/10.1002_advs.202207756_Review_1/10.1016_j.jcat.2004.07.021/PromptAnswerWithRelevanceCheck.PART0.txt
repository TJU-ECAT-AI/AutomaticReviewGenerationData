1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly discussed in the literature. However, the literature does provide insight into the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe. The modification of HZSM-5 with gallium was achieved by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate. The amount of modifying gallium ions was chosen to be 5 wt% corresponding to a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity. The impregnated zeolite powder was dried in air at 373 K and pressed into thin pellets with dimensions 15 × 5 mm. The pellets were then placed into a quartz part of the vacuum cell equipped with an CaF2 window and pretreated in the following manner. At first the zeolite was evacuated at 423 K for 2 h. Then the temperature was increased to 773 K at a heating rate of 3 K/min and the samples were further evacuated for 3 h followed by calcination in 70 Torr oxygen for 1 h. Finally, the zeolite was evacuated at 773 K and cooled in vacuo to room temperature. For reduction, the samples were exposed to 50 Torr hydrogen at 773 K. The exposure time was varied between 1 and 7 h. After such pretreatment the samples were characterized by DRIFT spectra at room temperature as prepared or probed by adsorbed carbon monoxide at room temperature (carbon monoxide pressure was varied from 10 to 200 Torr). Before CO adsorption hydrogen was evacuated at various temperatures. For spectral measurements the zeolite pellet was transferred from the quartz part of the vacuum cell to its opposite part equipped with the CaF2 window. DRIFT spectra of the thin pellets were recorded in the presence of gaseous carbon monoxide with a Nicolet Impact 410 spectrophotometer by means of a home-made diffuse reflectance attachment. All of the spectra were converted into KubelkaMunk units. The reflection ability of the zeolite at the wavelength of 5000 cm1 was set equal to 0.9 unit and the background spectrum of the zeolite was subtracted.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下，阐明Ga物种的主要挑战在文献中没有明确讨论。然而，文献确实提供了对还原Ga/HZSM-5沸石中镓状态的深入了解，通过使用吸附CO作为分子探针的高灵敏度DRIFT光谱。通过将硝酸镓的水溶液浸渍到HZSM-5中，实现了HZSM-5的镓改性。修改的镓离子的数量被选为5 wt%，对应于大约1的Ga/Al原子比。浸渍的沸石粉末在373 K的空气中干燥，并压成15×5 mm的薄片。然后将薄片放入配备有CaF2窗口的真空室的石英部分，并以以下方式预处理。首先，沸石在423 K下抽空2 h。然后，温度以3 K/min的加热速率升高到773 K，样品进一步抽空3 h，随后在70 Torr氧气中煅烧1 h。最后，沸石在773 K下抽空，并在真空下冷却至室温。为了还原，样品在773 K下暴露于50 Torr的氢气中。暴露时间在1至7 h之间变化。经过这样的预处理，样品在室温下以制备状态或在室温下通过吸附的碳单氧化物(碳单氧化物压力在10至200 Torr之间变化)进行DRIFT光谱表征。在CO吸附前，氢气在不同的温度下抽空。为了光谱测量，沸石薄片从真空室的石英部分转移到其相反部分，该部分配备有CaF2窗口。在Nicolet Impact 410光谱仪的存在下，用自制的漫反射附件记录了薄片的DRIFT光谱。所有光谱都转换为KubelkaMunk单位。沸石在5000 cm1波长下的反射能力等于0.9单位，沸石的背景光谱被减去。

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly stated in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention that the state of gallium in these catalysts has not been fully elucidated yet. Various studies show that only a small part of the protons is substituted by gallium ions upon calcination of catalysts prepared by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation. Instead, gallium is mostly present as small oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite micrograins. To increase the extent of proton substitution by gallium, such zeolites can be reduced in a hydrogen or hydrocarbon atmosphere at elevated temperatures, i.e., around 773 K. These treatments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the state of gallium under reaction conditions, which can advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在提供的文献中，没有明确说明在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的表征主要挑战。然而，文献确实提到，这些催化剂中镓的状态尚未完全阐明。各种研究表明，在通过离子交换或初始湿性浸渍制备的催化剂的煅烧过程中，只有少量的质子被镓离子取代。相反，镓主要以小氧化物颗粒的形式存在于沸石微粒的外表面。为了增加质子被镓取代的程度，这些沸石可以在高温(约773 K)下的氢气或烃类气氛中还原。这些处理促进了还原的镓物种迁移到沸石颗粒的微孔中，导致酸质子的更完全取代。原位或在线表征技术通过在反应条件下提供关于镓状态的实时信息，有助于克服这些挑战，从而推进我们对这些催化体系中结构-活性关系的理解。
