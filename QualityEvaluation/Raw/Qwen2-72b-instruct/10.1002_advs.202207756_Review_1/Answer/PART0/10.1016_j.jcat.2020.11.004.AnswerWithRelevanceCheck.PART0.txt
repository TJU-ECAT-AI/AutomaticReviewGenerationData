          [1] "However, Ga speciation under reaction condi- tions remains controversial."
          [2] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spec- troscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."
          [3] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
          [5] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species."
          [6] "This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions. In situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios. This technique provides direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, which may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of water as a probe molecule further supports the conclusion that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, with isolated Ga+ being easily oxidized by water at 150 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions.

          在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括：在还原后，与Bronsted酸位点(BAS)交换的Ga物种的不均一性，以及使用XANES光谱区分Ga+和低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种的困难。原位或原位表征技术，如原位透射FTIR光谱，通过为还原Ga/H-ZSM-5上存在两种类型的Ga物种提供直接的实验证据，有助于克服这些挑战，突出它们在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性的可能性。使用水作为探针分子进一步支持了孤立Ga+和Ga+H+对位点具有不同性质的结论，孤立Ga+在150 C下容易被水氧化，而Ga+H+对位点在相同条件下不活跃。
