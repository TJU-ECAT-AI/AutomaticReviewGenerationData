The elucidation of Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions presents significant challenges due to the complex and dynamic nature of the catalytic environment, which can lead to changes in the oxidation state and coordination environment of Ga under reaction conditions \[10.1039/c6cy00698a\]. The exact role of gallium in the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions has not been fully elucidated, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O, and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form \[10.1007/s10562-004-3753-x\]. The high operating temperatures and reducing environment make it difficult to detect short-lived reaction intermediates \[10.1002/advs.202207756_1\]. The controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions further complicates the understanding of its role in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), and In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy, are crucial for overcoming these challenges. These techniques provide real-time information about the structural and electronic properties of the active Ga species during catalysis, allowing for the monitoring of changes in the local structure and electronic environment of Ga under reaction conditions \[10.1039/c6cy00698a\]. They help in understanding the dynamic changes in the chemical state of Ga, particularly the reduction and reoxidation of Ga+3 species, and the formation of monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels \[10.1006/jcat.1993.1079\]. These techniques are well-suited for determining the Ga speciation and identifying reaction intermediates, contributing to a better understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems \[10.1002/advs.202207756_1\].

In situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios, providing direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, which may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The use of water as a probe molecule further supports the conclusion that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, with isolated Ga+ being easily oxidized by water at 150 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions.

In situ X-ray absorption techniques are extremely useful in detecting dispersed and isolated species, which helps in overcoming the challenges by providing quantitative correlations between dispersion, acidity, and reducibility of the oxide form of GaZSM5 catalysts of varying composition \[10.1021/jp111635\]. They allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species, providing insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems \[10.1021/jp111635\]. The data analysis has been generally limited to qualitative interpretation of the XANES and EXAFS spectra, but there is a need for quantitative correlation between the dispersion of the gallium species and their state of oxidation.

In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming the challenges by providing real-time information about the catalyst's structure and the active species under reaction conditions, thus advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems \[10.1016/s0167-2991(09)60939-3\]. They provide insights into the chemical state of modifying gallium ions and allow real-time monitoring of the catalyst under reaction conditions, which is crucial for advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.07.021\].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in in situ or operando characterization techniques have significantly contributed to our understanding of Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions. However, there is a need for more sophisticated and quantitative methods to correlate the dispersion of gallium species and their state of oxidation. Future research efforts might focus on developing advanced in situ or operando techniques that can provide quantitative information about the dispersion and oxidation state of gallium species under reaction conditions. This could involve the integration of multiple characterization techniques, such as XAS, FTIR, and other spectroscopic methods, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. The development of new catalysts with improved structure-activity relationships could also be a promising direction for future research, as it could lead to more efficient and selective propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
