In situ Ga K edge XANES study of the activation of Ga/ZSM-5 prepared by chemical vapor deposition of trimethylgallium Emiel J.M. Hensena,*, Mayela Garca-Sa ncheza, Neelesh Ranea, Pieter C.M.M.

Box 513, 5600, MB, Eindhoven, The Netherlands bDepartment of Chemistry, National Tsinghua University, Kuang Fu Road, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan, ROC Received 6 November 2004; accepted 3 December 2004 The activation of a dimethylgallium/ZSM-5 precursor to well-defined reduced and oxidized species is studied by in situ Ga K edge XANES. The precursor is prepared by chemical implanting of trimethylgallium on acidic HZSM-5. Subsequent reduction leads to charge-compensating Ga+ species. Direct oxidation of the trimethylgallium precursor leads to various forms of gallium oxide and regeneration of Brnsted acid protons. Oxidation of the reduced Ga+ species yields predominantly to GaO+ species.
The GaO+ species exhibit a much higher H2/D2 exchange activity than reduced Ga+ species.

1. Introduction
Gallium dispersed in acid materials can be applied to dehydrogenate alkanes. In combination with the shape- selective properties of a medium-pore zeolite such as ZSM-5, light paraffins can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and xylenes.
A commercial application is found in the Cyclar pro- cess [1,2]. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, olig- omerization and ring-closure steps. Despite consider- able research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [311], the exact role of gallium in this mech- anism has not been totally elucidated yet, with pro- posals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [36] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [811] receiving most attention. The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxi- dized or reduced form. Various methods to incorporate extra-framework gallium into the micropore space of HZSM-5 have been described [12] including impreg- nation [13,14] and ion-exchange [15] with Ga3+ salts,physical mixing with Ga2O3 [16] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of GaCl3 [17,18]. Impregnation, ion- exchange and physical mixing lead to poorly dispersed gallium oxide species, mostly present on the external zeolite surface. The dispersion can be increased by reduction of the gallium oxide [12], resulting in the formation of Ga+ species [14,16] or GaH2 + species [14] compensating the zeolite framework charge. The role of these reduced Ga+ species with respect to dehydroge- nation is not clear [16,19]. However, the reduction to Ga+ entities goes with a decrease in the Brnsted acidity [5,14], which will in turn strongly affect the overall performance in hydrocarbon reactions. The hydrolysis step after CVD of gallium chloride also leads to a variety of Ga species including GaO+ cations and Ga2O3 species [18,20].
In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]. In short, TMG can effectively replace the Brnsted acid protons in HZSM-5, resulting in mono- nuclear dimethylgallium species. Here, we report an in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study of the thermal activation of these species. Acti- vation was carried out by reduction with molecular hydrogen because this results in better-defined species compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]. Neverthe- less, we will also address the oxidation of the zeolite- occluded gallium alkyl species. A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a pre- requisite. Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation
TMG/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized by CVD of TMG (Aldrich, 99%) on HZSM-5 zeolite. To a glass vessel containing well-dried HZSM-5 zeolite (Akzo Nobel, Si/Al = 19.4), 1 ml of TMG was added in an Ar-flushed glove-box. After 24 h, the resulting material was evacuated for 2 h to remove unreacted TMG and gaseous reaction products,mainly methane.
The resulting material was kept in argon atmosphere prior to XANES characterization. The gallium loading was found to be 6.8 wt% by ICP analysis.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray absorption spectra were recorded at beamline
BL17C
of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The storage ring energy was operated at 1.5 GeV with the beam current between 120 and 200 mA. Absorption spectra were measured in transmission mode. The energy was scan- ned from 200 and 20 eV below the Ga K absorption edge (10,367 eV) to 1000 and 60 eV above the edge for EXAFS analysis and in situ XANES experiments,respectively. Standard Ga2O3 powder was used as a

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags.
