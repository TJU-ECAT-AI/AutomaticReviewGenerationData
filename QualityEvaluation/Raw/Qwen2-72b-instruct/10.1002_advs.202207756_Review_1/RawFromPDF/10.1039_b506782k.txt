The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modiﬁed HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by
diﬀuse reﬂectance infrared spectroscopy. Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modiﬁed by bivalent Zn and
univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly diﬀerent mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of
ethane by the acid–base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already
at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative
adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At
high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and
hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. Whereas in the zinc case a Brønsted acid proton is
formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride
species and does not lead to Brønsted acid protons. This diﬀerence in alkane activation has direct consequences
for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.
Introduction
Hydrogen forms of ZSM-5 zeolite modiﬁed by zinc or gallium
ions are known as catalysts for the aromatization of light
paraﬃns.1–9 A generalized mechanism consists of the activa-
tion of the paraﬃnic molecules by dehydrogenation over the
modifying cations and subsequent oligomerization of the
resulting oleﬁns over Brønsted acid sites. It is less clear which
sites catalyze the formation of aromatics. Besides acid sites,
also further dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon oligomers creat-
ing conjugated unsaturated fragments that are ﬁnally con-
verted
into
substituted
aromatics
or
coke,
should
be
considered.
In our previous studies we concluded that the active sites for
dissociative hydrogen10–12 and methane13,14 or ethane disso-
ciative adsorption and dehydrogenation15 over zinc-modiﬁed
HZSM-5 are acid–base pairs involving low-coordinated biva-
lent zinc cations located at isolated aluminum-occupied oxygen
tetrahedra and distantly separated basic oxygen atoms of the
zeolite framework. As the positive charge of these Zn21 cations
is only partially compensated, they show properties similar to
Lewis super acids. Molecular adsorption of ethane by such
sites is peculiar. Due to the strong polarizability of the ad-
sorbed ethane molecules the intensity of one of the infrared
bands belonging to C–H vibrational stretching modes increases
strongly, indicating selective polarizability of the correspond-
ing vibration.
Typically above 450 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption of
ethane takes place resulting in the formation of zinc–ethyl
fragments and acid protons that compensate the negative
framework charge at the basic sites of the zeolite framework.
Subsequent decomposition of alkyl species results in formation
of ethylene. In summary, the following reaction scheme
was proposed
ZO  Zn21 þ ZO þ C2H6 - ZO  Zn21-C2H6 þ ZO

In the present work, we carried out a similar DRIFT
experiments for ethane adsorption and dehydrogenation on
reduced gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite and compared
the obtained results with those for zinc modiﬁed ZSM-5
samples. The reduced Ga species were chosen because they
are predominant under typical reaction conditions during
alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. We have found
that the activation of ethane over Ga1 and Zn21 cations
proceeds via two dinstinctly diﬀerent mechanisms. The con-
sequences of these diﬀerent ways of alkane activation are
evaluated by studying the catalytic conversion of ethane over
zinc- and gallium-modiﬁed HZSM-5.
Experimental
Materials
The initial hydrogen form of ZSM-5 was prepared by decom-
position of NH4ZSM-5 zeolite from AlSi-Penta with a frame-
work SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of approximately 44 in ﬂowing air at
773 K. Gallium modiﬁcation was achieved by chemical reac-
tion of HZSM-5 with Ga(CH3)3 as described earlier,16,17 while
Zn/ZSM-5 was prepared by exposing well-dehydrated HZSM-

5 to zinc metal vapor, leading to the replacement of Brønsted
acid protons by divalent zinc cations concomitant with evolu-
tion of molecular hydrogen.13–15 This leads to ﬁnal metal to Al
ratios of Ga/Al ¼ 1 and Zn/Al ¼ 0.5, respectively. The
preparation was carried out in situ in an optical cell or in an
Ar-ﬂushed glove-box. In the case of Ga/ZSM-5 preparation,
we exposed a pellet of dehydrated zeolite to Ga(CH3)3 (Strem
Chemicals) vapor in the optical cell also used for subsequent
DRIFT measurements. Subsequent reduction of the modiﬁed
zeolite by molecular hydrogen to remove the methyl groups
was carried out in situ and was followed by evacuation at
773 K. Previous studies16,17 have shown that this method leads
to the quantitative substitution of protons and transformation
of the gallium alkyl into Ga11 species.
Infrared spectroscopy
Spectral measurements were carried out after in situ pretreat-
ment in an optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window.18 Ethane
adsorption was carried out at various pressures. DRIFT
spectra were recorded at room temperature by a Nicolet
Impact 410 spectrophotometer equipped with a home-made
diﬀuse reﬂectance attachment. The measurements were carried
out either in the presence of gaseous ethane or after evacuation
of ethane at room or elevated temperature. All spectra were
transformed into Kubelka–Munk units by a standard program
assuming that the reﬂectance ability of the zeolite at 5000 cm1
was equal to 0.9. Subsequently, the background created by the
zeolites was subtracted from the spectra. Ethane was puriﬁed
before spectral measurements by triple vacuum distillation
after freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature.
Reactivity
A model catalytic study of ethane dehydrogenation and aro-
matization was carried out in a single-pass ﬂow reactor
equipped with a sixteen-valve sample loop system for chroma-
tographic (GC-17A, FID, KCl/Al2O3 Plot column) product
analysis at short reaction times. The feed consisted of a helium
ﬂow of 100 N ml min1 containing 1 vol% ethane. After
preparation in an Ar-ﬂushed glove-box, catalysts were loaded
in the quartz reactor and transferred to the reaction setup in
protective atmosphere. The catalyst weight amounted to 50 mg
for both zinc or gallium modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites. Catalyst
pretreatment involved in situ reduction in hydrogen at a rate of
100 N ml min1 whilst heating from room temperature to
823 K at a rate of 5 K min1. The reaction temperature was
823 K and the reaction products were followed for 3 h.
Results and discussion
Infrared spectroscopy
Fig. 1 displays the DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorbed on Zn/
ZSM-5 at room temperature.15 The spectrum consists of a
superposition of infrared bands resulting from two diﬀerent
modes of molecular absorption. Four narrow high-frequency
bands belong to weakly adsorbed species that disappear upon
evacuation at room temperature. The broad band that has
been shifted strongly to lower frequencies corresponds to a
stronger form of molecular adsorption, ascribed to ethane
molecules that are very strongly polarized by zinc cations of
which the positive charge has only been partially compen-
sated.9–12 Complete removal of this band is possible only after
very prolonged evacuation at room temperature. Fig. 2 shows
that at very low hydrocarbon partial pressures the DRIFT
spectrum of this form of molecular adsorption can be well
separated from the weaker physical adsorption. Already below
500 K, this complex decomposes giving a zinc–ethyl fragment
concomitant with regeneration of Brønsted acid protons iden-
tiﬁed by the characteristic stretching band of hydroxyl groups
at 3610 cm1. Further heating above 500 K decomposes the
zinc–ethyl fragment to ethylene and zinc–hydride species.15
The DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorbed by reduced Ga/
ZSM-5 is shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of this spectrum with
the one of ethane adsorbed by Zn/ZSM-5 shows that the high-

frequency parts of both spectra are identical. Moreover, as
follows from Fig. 3, a similar DRIFT spectrum with lower
intensity was observed for ethane adsorption on the hydrogen
form of the same zeolite. This indicates relatively weak physical
absorption of ethane by HZSM-5 or the Ga1 cations in
reduced Ga/ZSM-5. Further support for this weak absorption
is provided by the observation that upon a decrease of the
ethane partial pressure the narrow DRIFT bands in the spectra
of Ga/ZSM-5 and HZSM-5 decreased in intensity in a similar
fashion and completely disappeared after evacuation at room
temperature.
On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows that after heating of
Ga/ZSM-5 in ethane atmosphere to 523 K four much weaker
C–H stretching bands with maxima at 2882, 2914, 2939 and
2962 cm1 appeared which could not be destroyed by evacua-
tion at room temperature. This result points to dissociative
adsorption of ethane on univalent Ga cations at elevated
temperature, the weak bands corresponding to ethyl species
grafted to Ga1. This suggestion is further underpinned by the
appearance of gallium-hydride species that were identiﬁed by
their infrared band at 2057 cm1 with a shoulder at 2040 cm1.
After further heating and decomposition of the grafted ethyl
species (vide infra), the infrared band around 2040 cm1
becomes dominant at the expense of the high-frequency band
(Fig. 5).
These ﬁndings present an important diﬀerence with the
heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane by the zinc–oxy-
gen acid–base pairs in Zn/ZSM-5. Whereas in the latter zeolite
the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane leads to the
reappearance of the infrared band at 3610 cm1 belonging to
Brønsted acid protons, no regeneration of protons was ob-
served for Ga/ZSM-5. From this we infer that dissociative
chemisorption proceeds via dissociative adsorption of ethane
to charge-compensating reduced Ga1 species, ﬁnally resulting
in the formation of gallium hydride and ethyl fragments
according to the following reaction
ZO  Ga1 þ C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5
)]1
(2)
Theoretical calculations are necessary to establish whether
this step is an elementary reaction or whether it involves
participation of basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.
Indeed, our previous study18 allowed the assignment of infra-
red bands in gallium-containing ZSM-5 in the region of 2040–
2060 cm1 to gallium hydride species resulting from dissocia-
tive adsorption of molecular hydrogen by Ga1 ions. Moreover,
we found that the band with a maximum at 2040 cm1 belongs
to gallium dihydrides, while that one at 2057 cm1 relates to
gallium monohydride. We infer this from the change of the
single feature found at 2040 cm1 into two bands at 2040 and
2057 cm1 after oxidation of gallium dihydrides with nitrous
oxide. The former band is largely absent after complete oxida-
tion of GaH2
1 species. This is attributed to the following
reactions
ZO  Ga1 þ H2 - ZO  [Ga31(H)2]1
(3)
ZO  [Ga31(H)2]1 þ N2O -
ZO  [Ga31(H)(OH)]1 þ N2
(4)
Thus, the appearance of a band at 2057 cm1 provides
additional support for the dissociation of ethane over Ga1
species according to eqn. (2), giving a monohydride (band 2057
cm1) and a grafted ethyl fragment (bands between 2800 and
3000 cm1). The band at 2040 cm1 belongs to a gallium
dihydride species, possibly deriving from partial decomposi-
tion of the ethyl fragments.
The relatively high stability of the products of dissociative
ethane adsorption is in line with the high thermal stability of
gallium dihydride species that can only be eliminated by
desorption above 673 K.18 Prolonged heating of Ga/ZSM-5
in ethane atmosphere at a temperature of 573 K resulted in a
shift of the maximum of the band belonging to Ga-H from

2057 to 2040 cm1. This should point to the subsequent
dissociation of the ethyl species coordinating to Ga1 ions,
resulting in the formation of gallium dihydride species. Con-
comitantly, new C–H stretching bands appear at higher fre-
quencies, i.e. at 3024, 3055 and 3072 cm1 (Fig. 5), that are
typical for oleﬁns or aromatic hydrocarbons.

Comparison of infrared spectra of ethane adsorbed on zinc-
and gallium-modiﬁed ZSM-5 indicates that hydrocarbon acti-
vation over the charge-compensating reduced cations proceeds
via two distinctly diﬀerent mechanisms. Over Zn/ZSM-5 ad-
sorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic
dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon
subsequent heating. On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane
much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was
only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane
dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions,
giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31
species. Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation
of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species.
Reactivity
The diﬀerence in the mechanism in alkane activation should
have direct consequences for the product mixture observed
during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion. To this end, we
studied conversion of ethane over Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5
at elevated temperatures. The conversion as a function of the
reaction time for both zeolites is displayed in Fig. 6. Zn/ZSM-5
displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This
corresponds to the ﬁnding that ethane is more readily activated
over the zinc–oxygen acid–base pairs than over Ga1 cations.
Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction
time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction,
indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation.
Table 1 collects the selectivity data of both zeolites as a
function of the reaction time. The only product observed
during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The
further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is
impeded by the absence of Brønsted acidity in reduced
Ga/ZSM-5, although one should also take into account the
relatively low conversion. Extensive studies in the past have
suggested that Brønsted acid protons are required for the
aromatization of the oligomeric intermediates.3 On the other
hand, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion
and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene.
The concomitant formation of aromatic products should be
explained by the regeneration of Brønsted acid sites via hetero-
lytic dissociative adsorption of ethane according to reaction
(1). Moreover, this leads to coke formation as observed by a
physical colour change of the catalyst to black and pronounced
deactivation. Also, the carbon balance is not closed for
Zn/ZSM-5 (Table 1) due to the deposition of carbonaceous
residue in the catalyst bed. This deactivation leads to a lower
conversion, a concomitant increase in ethylene selectivity and
less pronounced coke formation at higher reaction times. This
may be primarily attributed to the deactivation of Brønsted
acid sites that play an important role in the formation of
aromatics and coke.
Conclusions
Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room tempera-
ture, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon
heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid
Zn21–basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brønsted acid protons.
Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and
hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative
addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures.
This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments
grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into
ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brønsted acid
proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation
results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into
ethylene. On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher
initial activity but suﬀers from coking deactivation and sec-
ondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of
Brønsted acidity.
