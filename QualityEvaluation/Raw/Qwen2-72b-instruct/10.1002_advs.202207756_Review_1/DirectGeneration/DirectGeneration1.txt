Elucidating the speciation of gallium (Ga) in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions presents significant challenges due to the dynamic and complex nature of the catalytic environment. The importance of this endeavor lies in the direct correlation between the Ga speciation and the catalytic activity and selectivity, which are critical for optimizing PDH processes. Methodological approaches to this challenge often involve a combination of ex situ and in situ/operando techniques. Ex situ methods, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), provide static structural and compositional information but lack the ability to capture dynamic changes under reaction conditions. In contrast, in situ/operando techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), offer real-time insights into the structural and electronic states of Ga species during PDH. These methods are crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships, as they can reveal how changes in Ga speciation correlate with variations in catalytic performance. By integrating these techniques, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, paving the way for the design of more efficient and selective PDH catalysts.
