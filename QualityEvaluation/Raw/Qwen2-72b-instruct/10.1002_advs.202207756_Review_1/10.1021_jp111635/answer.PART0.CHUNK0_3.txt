1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly stated in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention that the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions, which makes its detection and characterization difficult. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, are extremely useful as they allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species, providing insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下，阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的特性所面临的首要挑战在提供的文献中没有明确说明。然而，文献确实提到活性镓物种高度分散，仅在反应(还原)条件下存在，这使得其检测和表征变得困难。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱，极其有用，因为它们允许检测分散甚至孤立的物种，为这些催化体系的结构-活性关系提供了见解。
