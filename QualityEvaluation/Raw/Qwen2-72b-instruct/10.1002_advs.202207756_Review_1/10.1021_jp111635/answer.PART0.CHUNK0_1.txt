1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly stated in the provided literature. However, the literature does mention that the nature of the active gallium species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions. In situ X-ray absorption techniques are extremely useful as they allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species and were already used in the literature in order to study this system. The data analysis has been generally limited to qualitative interpretation of the XANES (qualitative correlations between edge shifts and oxidation state of gallium atoms) and EXAFS spectra (qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species). In particular, we found no attempt in the literature to quantitatively correlate the dispersion of the gallium species, obtained from EXAFS measurements, and their state of oxidation, obtained from XANES measurements in the same experiments.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的主要挑战在提供的文献中没有明确说明。但是,文献确实提到活性镓物种的性质仍然不清楚,主要是因为活性镓物种高度分散,仅在反应(还原)条件下存在。原位X射线吸收技术极其有用,因为它们允许检测分散甚至孤立的物种,并且已经在文献中用于研究这个系统。数据分析通常仅限于XANES的定性解释(镓原子氧化态与边缘位移之间的定性相关性)和EXAFS光谱(关于镓物种分散的定性结论)。特别是,我们没有发现文献中尝试在相同实验中从EXAFS测量获得的镓物种的分散与从XANES测量获得的氧化状态进行定量相关。
