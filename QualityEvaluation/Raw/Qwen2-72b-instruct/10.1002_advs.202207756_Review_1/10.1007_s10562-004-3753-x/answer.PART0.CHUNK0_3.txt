1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly stated in the literature. However, the literature does mention that the exact role of gallium in the mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions has not been totally elucidated yet, with various proposals for its role receiving attention. The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the changes in the gallium species during catalysis, which can advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战在文献中没有明确说明。然而，文献确实提到，镓在脱氢反应机制中的确切作用尚未完全阐明，各种关于其作用的提议都受到了关注。活性内沸石Ga物种的结构及其在氧化和还原条件下的反应性尚未完全解决，这是由于可能的结构种类繁多，包括沸石表面的Ga2O3团聚物，沸石微孔空间中的小镓氧化物团聚物，还原的Ga物种如Ga2O和氧化或还原形式的Ga阳离子物种。原位或操作条件下表征技术通过提供催化过程中镓物种变化的实时信息，有助于克服这些挑战，从而推进我们对这些催化体系中结构-活性关系的理解。
