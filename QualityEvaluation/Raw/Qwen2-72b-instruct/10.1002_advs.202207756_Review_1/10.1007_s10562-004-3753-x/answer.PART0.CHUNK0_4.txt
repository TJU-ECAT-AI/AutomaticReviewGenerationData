1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, the literature does indicate that the wide variety of possible structures of Ga species, including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O, and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form, has not been fully resolved yet. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by allowing the study of catalytic materials under conditions relevant to catalysis, providing insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战在文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献确实指出,各种可能的Ga物种结构,包括外部沸石表面的Ga2O3团聚物,沸石微孔空间中的小镓氧化物团聚物,还原的Ga物种如Ga2O,以及氧化或还原形式的阳离子Ga物种,尚未完全解决。原位或操作表征技术通过允许在与催化相关的条件下研究催化材料,为克服这些挑战做出了贡献,为这些催化系统中的结构-活性关系提供了见解。
