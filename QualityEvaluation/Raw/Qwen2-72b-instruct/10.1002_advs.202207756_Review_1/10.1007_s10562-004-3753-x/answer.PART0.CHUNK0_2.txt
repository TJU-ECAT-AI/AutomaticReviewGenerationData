1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are not explicitly mentioned in the literature. However, the literature does highlight the complexity of the gallium species that can form under different pretreatment conditions, including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O, and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form. The wide variety of possible structures makes it difficult to determine the exact role of gallium in the dehydrogenation mechanism. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as XANES, contribute to overcoming these challenges by allowing the study of catalytic materials under conditions relevant to catalysis, providing insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的主要挑战在文献中没有明确提及。但是,文献确实强调了在不同的预处理条件下可以形成的镓物种的复杂性,包括在沸石表面的Ga2O3团聚物,在沸石微孔空间中被封闭的小镓氧化物团聚物,被还原的Ga物种如Ga2O,以及在氧化或还原形式下的阳离子Ga物种。可能结构的广泛多样性使得很难确定镓在脱氢机制中的确切作用。原位或操作表征技术,如XANES,通过允许在与催化相关的条件下研究催化材料,为克服这些挑战做出了贡献,为这些催化系统中的结构-活性关系提供了见解。
