1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complex and dynamic nature of the catalytic environment, which can lead to changes in the oxidation state and coordination environment of Ga under reaction conditions. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), can provide real-time information about the electronic and geometric structure of the active sites under reaction conditions, which is crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. These techniques help overcome the challenges by providing direct evidence of the active species and their evolution during the reaction, thus advancing our understanding of the mechanism of PDH over Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的主要挑战包括催化环境的复杂性和动态性，这可能导致Ga在反应条件下的氧化态和配位环境发生变化。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱(XAS)，可以提供关于反应条件下活性位点的电子和几何结构的实时信息，这对于理解这些催化体系的结构-活性关系至关重要。这些技术通过提供关于反应过程中活性物种及其演变的直接证据，帮助克服了挑战，从而加深了我们对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上PDH机制的理解。
