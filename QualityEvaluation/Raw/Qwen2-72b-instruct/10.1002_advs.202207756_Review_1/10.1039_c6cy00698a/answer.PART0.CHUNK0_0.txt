1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complex and dynamic nature of the catalytic environment, which can lead to changes in the oxidation state and coordination environment of Ga under reaction conditions. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), can provide real-time information about the electronic and geometric structure of the active sites under reaction conditions, which is crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. These techniques help overcome the challenges by providing direct evidence of the active species and their evolution during the reaction, thus advancing our understanding of the mechanism of PDH over Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
