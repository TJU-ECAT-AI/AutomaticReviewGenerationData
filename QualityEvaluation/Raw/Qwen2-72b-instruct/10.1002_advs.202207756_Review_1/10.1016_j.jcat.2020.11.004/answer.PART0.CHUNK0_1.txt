[1] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[2] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species."
[3] "This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) after reduction, and the difficulty in differentiating Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species using XANES spectra. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of water as a probe molecule further supports the conclusion that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, with isolated Ga+ being easily oxidized by water at 150 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括：在还原后，与Bronsted酸位点(BAS)交换的Ga物种的不均一性，以及使用XANES光谱区分Ga+和低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种的困难。原位或原位表征技术，如原位透射FTIR光谱，通过为还原Ga/H-ZSM-5上存在两种类型的Ga物种提供直接的实验证据，有助于克服这些挑战，突出它们在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性的可能性。使用水作为探针分子进一步支持了孤立Ga+和Ga+H+对位点具有不同性质的结论，孤立Ga+在150 C下容易被水氧化，而Ga+H+对位点在相同条件下不活跃。
