[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts."
[2] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[3] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24]."
[4] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."

[8] "Journal of Catalysis 393 (2021) 6069 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Catalysis journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30]."
[9] "Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH. However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C."
[10] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[11] "FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample."
[12] "Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations."
[13] "The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations."
[14] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[15] "Quantitative correlations between the consumption of the BAS and the Ga loading are obtained by determining the BAS density after reduction using pyridine as a probe molecule."
[16] "Ga hydride species are characterized at the temperature close to that of typical PDH conditions, revealing the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with BAS after reduction."
[17] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species."
[18] "This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

1. The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complex nature of the catalyst, the dynamic changes in the catalyst structure during the reaction, and the difficulty in distinguishing between various Ga species using traditional characterization techniques. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the catalyst structure and the identity of catalytic active sites under reaction conditions. These techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction. However, XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. In-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy has been used to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios, revealing the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) after reduction. This technique provides direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species, which have different reactivities and properties.

1. 在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括催化剂的复杂性、反应过程中催化剂结构的动态变化以及使用传统表征技术区分各种Ga物种的困难。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、离位FTIR和NH3-温度程序脱附(NH3-TPD)，通过在反应条件下提供关于催化剂结构和催化活性位点身份的实时信息，有助于克服这些挑战。这些技术已被用于探究Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种并识别PDH反应中的活性位点。然而，XANES光谱不足以区分Ga+与低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种。原位透射FTIR光谱已被用于系统地研究具有不同Si/Al比和Ga/Al比的Ga/H-ZSM-5样品中的Ga物种，揭示了还原后与Bronsted酸位(BAS)交换的Ga物种的不均一性。该技术为Ga+H+对位和孤立Ga+位的存在提供了直接的实验证据，这些位具有不同的反应性和性质。
