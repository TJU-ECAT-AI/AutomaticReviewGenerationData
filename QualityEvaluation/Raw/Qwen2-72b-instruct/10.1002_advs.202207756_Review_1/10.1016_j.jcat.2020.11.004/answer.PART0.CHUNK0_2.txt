[1] "However, Ga speciation under reaction condi- tions remains controversial."
[2] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spec- troscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."
[3] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions. In situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios. This technique provides direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, which may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括Ga物种在反应条件下的争议性质。采用原位透射傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱法系统研究了具有不同Si/Al比和Ga/Al比的Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种。该技术为还原Ga/H-ZSM-5上存在两种类型的Ga物种提供了直接的实验证据，这些物种可能在烷烃脱氢反应中具有不同的催化活性。
