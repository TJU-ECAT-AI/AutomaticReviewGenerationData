1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) after reduction, and the difficulty in differentiating Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species using XANES spectra. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of water as a probe molecule further supports the conclusion that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, with isolated Ga+ being easily oxidized by water at 150 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括：在还原后，与Bronsted酸位点(BAS)交换的Ga物种的不均一性，以及使用XANES光谱区分Ga+和低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种的困难。原位或原位表征技术，如原位透射FTIR光谱，通过为还原Ga/H-ZSM-5上存在两种类型的Ga物种提供直接的实验证据，有助于克服这些挑战，突出它们在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性的可能性。使用水作为探针分子进一步支持了孤立Ga+和Ga+H+对位点具有不同性质的结论，孤立Ga+在150 C下容易被水氧化，而Ga+H+对位点在相同条件下不活跃。

[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras- tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem- icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy- drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc- ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat- alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen- tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612], Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts."
[2] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research [911,2123]."
[3] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3- temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction [911,24]."
[4] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."

[8] "Journal of Catalysis 393 (2021) 6069 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Catalysis journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi- ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species [11,30]."
[9] "Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec- troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH. However, they collected spectra at room temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C."
[10] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis [11]."
[11] "FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con- ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe- ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample."
[12] "Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,and DFT calculations."
[13] "The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso- lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9 11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi- rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character- izations and computational investigations."
[14] "In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7)."
[15] "Quantitative correlations between the consumption of the BAS and the Ga loading are obtained by determining the BAS density after reduction using pyridine as a probe molecule."
[16] "Ga hydride species are characterized at the temperature close to that of typical PDH conditions, revealing the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with BAS after reduction."
[17] "These observations offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species."
[18] "This conclusion is further supported by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot."

1. The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complex nature of the catalyst, the dynamic changes in the catalyst structure during the reaction, and the difficulty in distinguishing between various Ga species using traditional characterization techniques. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the catalyst structure and the identity of catalytic active sites under reaction conditions. These techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction. However, XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species. In-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy has been used to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios, revealing the inhomogeneity of Ga species exchanged with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) after reduction. This technique provides direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species, which have different reactivities and properties.
