[1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structure-activity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."
[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."
[3] "PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally."
[4] "X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."
[5] "In situ XAS investigations provided crucial information regarding how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction."
[6] "In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include the high operating temperatures and reducing environment, which make it difficult to detect short-lived reaction intermediates. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ FTIR spectroscopy, are crucial for overcoming these challenges. XAS, which can be conducted in situ or operando, is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions. In situ XAS investigations have provided crucial information on how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction. In situ FTIR spectroscopy, with its chemical specificity, is well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates.

1.在PDH条件下，确定Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga的形态的主要挑战包括高温和还原环境，这使得检测短寿命的反应中间体变得困难。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和原位FTIR光谱，对于克服这些挑战至关重要。XAS可以在原位或操作条件下进行，非常适合确定PDH条件下Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga形态。原位XAS研究提供了关于Ga物种在还原过程中如何迁移到沸石孔中的关键信息。原位FTIR光谱，由于其化学特异性，非常适合识别反应中间体。
