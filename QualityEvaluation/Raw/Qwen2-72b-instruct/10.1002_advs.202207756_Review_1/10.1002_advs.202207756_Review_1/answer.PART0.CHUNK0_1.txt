[1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structure-activity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."
[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."
[3] "PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally."
[4] "X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."
[5] "In situ XAS investigations provided crucial information regarding how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction."
[6] "In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include the high operating temperatures and reducing environment, which make it difficult to detect short-lived reaction intermediates. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ FTIR spectroscopy, are crucial because they can provide information about the Ga speciation under actual reaction conditions. These techniques have contributed to our understanding of how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction and have helped in identifying reaction intermediates, thus advancing our knowledge of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

1.在PDH条件下，确定Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga的形态的主要挑战包括高温和还原环境，这使得检测短寿命的反应中间体变得困难。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和原位FTIR光谱，至关重要，因为它们可以在实际反应条件下提供关于Ga形态的信息。这些技术有助于我们理解Ga物种在还原过程中如何迁移到沸石孔中，并有助于识别反应中间体，从而推进了我们对这些催化体系中结构-活性关系的理解。
