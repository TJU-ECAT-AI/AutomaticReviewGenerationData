[1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structure-activity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."
[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."
[3] "PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally."
[4] "X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."
[5] "In situ XAS investigations provided crucial information regarding how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction."
[6] "In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

1.The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include the high temperatures and reducing environment that make it difficult to detect reaction intermediates. The high temperatures cause intermediates to be short-lived, while the reducing environment produced by hydrogen complicates the speciation of Ga. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ FTIR spectroscopy, are crucial because they can provide information about the Ga speciation under actual PDH conditions. XAS, which can be conducted in situ or operando, is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions. In situ XAS investigations have provided crucial information about how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction. In situ FTIR spectroscopy, with its chemical specificity, is well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates.

1.在PDH条件下，阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga的物种是一个主要挑战，这包括高温和还原环境使得检测反应中间体变得困难。高温导致中间体寿命短，而氢产生的还原环境使Ga的物种复杂化。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱(XAS)和原位FTIR光谱，至关重要，因为它们可以在实际PDH条件下提供Ga物种的信息。XAS可以在原位或操作条件下进行，非常适合确定Ga/H-ZSM-5在PDH条件下的Ga物种。原位XAS研究提供了关于Ga物种在还原过程中如何迁移到沸石孔中的关键信息。原位FTIR光谱，由于其化学特异性，非常适合识别反应中间体。
