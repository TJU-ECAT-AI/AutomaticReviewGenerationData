[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
[2] "Here, we describe studies of the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge."
[3] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

1.The primary challenge in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions is the dynamic nature of the Ga species, which can change between reduced and oxidized states depending on the reaction conditions. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge, are crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems because they allow for real-time monitoring of the chemical state of Ga under reaction conditions. This is essential because the chemical form of catalytic sites can be misleading when determined solely by pre- and postreaction characterization, as it may not reflect the active species present during the reaction.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的主要挑战是Ga物种的动态性质，它会根据反应条件在还原和氧化状态之间变化。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如Ga K边X射线吸收光谱，对于理解这些催化体系中的结构-活性关系至关重要，因为它们允许实时监测反应条件下Ga的化学状态。这是必不可少的，因为仅通过反应前和反应后的表征来确定催化位点的化学形式可能会产生误导，因为它可能无法反映反应过程中存在的活性物种。
