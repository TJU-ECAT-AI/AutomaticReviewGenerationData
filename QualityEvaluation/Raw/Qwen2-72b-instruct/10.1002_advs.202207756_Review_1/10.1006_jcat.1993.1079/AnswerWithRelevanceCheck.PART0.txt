          [1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
          [2] "Here, we describe studies of the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge."
          [3] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."
          [4] "Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions."
          [5] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
          [6] "These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5."
          [7] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."

          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include understanding the dynamic changes in the chemical state of Ga, particularly the reduction and reoxidation of Ga+3 species, and the formation of monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge, contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the physical and chemical state of Ga under reaction conditions. This approach helps to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and avoids misleading conclusions that can arise from pre- and postreaction characterization, which may not accurately represent the active state of the catalyst.

          在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的挑战主要包括理解Ga的化学状态的动态变化，特别是Ga+3物种的还原和再氧化，以及单体氢化物物种的形成。原位或操作条件下表征技术，如Ga K边X射线吸收光谱，通过在反应条件下提供Ga的物理和化学状态的实时信息，有助于克服这些挑战。这种方法有助于确定催化位点的化学形式，并避免了仅从反应前后的表征得出的可能不准确表示催化剂活性状态的误导性结论。
