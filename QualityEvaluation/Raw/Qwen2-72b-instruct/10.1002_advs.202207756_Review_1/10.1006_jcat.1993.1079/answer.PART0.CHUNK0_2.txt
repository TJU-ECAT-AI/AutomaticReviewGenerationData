[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
[2] "Here, we describe studies of the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge."
[3] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

1.The primary challenge in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions is the dynamic nature of the Ga species, which can change between reduced and oxidized states depending on the reaction conditions. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ga K-edge, are crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems because they allow for real-time monitoring of the chemical state of Ga under reaction conditions. This is essential because the active forms of Ga may only exist under reaction conditions and can be misleadingly characterized if only pre- and postreaction methods are used.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂下丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga物种的主要挑战是Ga物种的动态性质，这取决于反应条件，可以在还原和氧化状态之间变化。原位或操作表征技术，如Ga K边的X射线吸收光谱，对于理解这些催化系统中的结构-活性关系至关重要，因为它们允许在反应条件下实时监测Ga的化学状态。这是必不可少的，因为活性形式的Ga可能仅在反应条件下存在，如果仅使用预反应和后反应方法进行表征，可能会产生误导。
