Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

1.The document does not provide a direct comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does mention that SO2 is used as an oxidant in the selective oxidation of propane to propylene. The effectiveness of SO2 in this process is demonstrated by the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, which selectively accelerate the interaction of propane with SO2. The document does not discuss the use of H2S or S2 as oxidants in this context. The specific challenges associated with SO2 as an oxidant are not detailed, but the document does mention that the formation of surface Pb, Bi, or Fe sulfides is unfavorable for the reaction. Future research could focus on optimizing the catalyst design to enhance the activity and selectivity of OCP towards propylene formation, as well as investigating the role of different sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process.

1.文档没有直接比较不同基于硫的氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯过程中的有效性。然而，它确实提到SO2被用作生成丙烯的丙烷选择性氧化过程中的氧化剂。SO2在这一过程中的有效性通过催化表面形成氧化缩合产物（OCP）得到证明，这些产物选择性地加速了丙烷与SO2的相互作用。文档没有讨论H2S或S2作为这一背景下的氧化剂的使用。与SO2作为氧化剂相关的具体挑战没有详细说明，但文档确实提到，表面Pb、Bi或Fe硫化物的形成对反应不利。未来的研究可以集中在优化催化剂设计，以增强OCP对丙烯形成的活性和选择性，以及调查不同基于硫的氧化剂在ODHP过程中的作用。

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of SO2 as an oxidant in the selective oxidation of propane over various catalysts. The main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts were propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon, and sulphur. The catalytic properties of Al, Ga, Si, Bi, Pb, and Fe oxides, as well as carbon, were investigated. The literature suggests that oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S, which form during the reaction over Ga, Al, Si oxides, and carbon, are active towards propylene formation. Sulphidization of Fe, Bi, and Pb oxides in the reaction did not increase the activity. The role of sulphur in OCP is proposed to participate in the limiting reaction step. The literature does not provide specific challenges associated with each oxidant or key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

1.文献没有直接比较不同基于硫的氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯中的有效性。然而，它确实讨论了SO2作为氧化剂在各种催化剂上选择性氧化丙烷的有效性。在研究的催化剂上，丙烷氧化的主要产物是丙烯、乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫。研究了Al、Ga、Si、Bi、Pb和Fe氧化物以及碳的催化性能。文献表明，在Ga、Al、Si氧化物和碳上反应过程中形成的包含C、H、O和S的氧化缩合产物（OCP）对丙烯的形成具有活性。Fe、Bi和Pb氧化物在反应中的硫化并没有增加活性。OCP中硫的作用被提议参与限速反应步骤。文献没有提供与每个氧化剂相关的具体挑战或改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键研究领域。
