1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of SO2 as an oxidant in the selective oxidation of propane over various catalysts. The main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts were propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon, and sulphur. The catalytic properties of Al, Ga, Si, Bi, Pb, and Fe oxides, as well as carbon, were investigated. The literature suggests that oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S, which form during the reaction over Ga, Al, Si oxides, and carbon, are active towards propylene formation. Sulphidization of Fe, Bi, and Pb oxides in the reaction did not increase the activity. The role of sulphur in OCP is proposed to participate in the limiting reaction step. The literature does not provide specific challenges associated with each oxidant or key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

1.文献没有直接比较不同基于硫的氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯中的有效性。然而，它确实讨论了SO2作为氧化剂在各种催化剂上选择性氧化丙烷的有效性。在研究的催化剂上，丙烷氧化的主要产物是丙烯、乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫。研究了Al、Ga、Si、Bi、Pb和Fe氧化物以及碳的催化性能。文献表明，在Ga、Al、Si氧化物和碳上反应过程中形成的包含C、H、O和S的氧化缩合产物（OCP）对丙烯的形成具有活性。Fe、Bi和Pb氧化物在反应中的硫化并没有增加活性。OCP中硫的作用被提议参与限速反应步骤。文献没有提供与每个氧化剂相关的具体挑战或改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键研究领域。
