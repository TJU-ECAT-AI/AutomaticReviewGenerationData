[1] "For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."
[2] "However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."
[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[8] "The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction."
[9] "As postulated, sulfur in the diatomic state (active species) may abstract H species from an alkane."
[10] "The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."
[11] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."
[12] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."
[13] "The authors proposed that CH activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane."
[14] "Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites."

1.Sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, have been shown to improve propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. However, the use of SO2 results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. A major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2. Future research should focus on developing a structureactivity relationship to rationally design catalysts. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor in hydrogenation reactions is well studied. Sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S can reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction. Sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. Sulfur-based byproducts such as CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species. Propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2.

1.硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯方面，与传统氧化剂相比，显示出提高丙烯产量的效果。然而，使用SO2会导致丙烯产量较低，因为大量金属氧化物催化剂上会形成COx产物。使用软氧化剂如S2可以减少ZrO2上丙烷的过度氧化。设计高效S2ODHP催化剂的主要挑战是副产物如CS2的形成。未来的研究应集中在开发结构活性关系，以合理设计催化剂。硫在氢化反应中作为促进剂或抑制剂的作用在文献中得到了广泛研究。像S2和H2S这样的硫化合物可以减少氧化脱氢反应中烷烃和烯烃的过度氧化。需要更短的停留时间来抑制裂解反应。二原子态的硫可能从烷烃中提取氢。S2的存在提高了C3H6的产量和选择性，但催化剂对转化率几乎没有影响，这表明气相反应占主导地位。在反应器流出物中观察到CS2等硫基副产物。丙烯形成的表观活化能随着金属硫键强度的降低而降低。CH活化通过表面硫物种进行。丙烯和H2S的形成导致硫空位，而气相S2补充了这些硫空位。
