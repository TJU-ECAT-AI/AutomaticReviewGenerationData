[1] "For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."
[2] "However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."
[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[6] "The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions."
[7] "Sulfur compounds, such as S2 and H2S, have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH)."
[8] "The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction."
[9] "As postulated, sulfur in the diatomic state (active species) may abstract H species from an alkane."
[10] "The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."
[11] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."
[12] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."
[13] "The authors proposed that CH activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane."
[14] "Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites."

1.Sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, have been shown to improve propylene yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. However, the use of SO2 leads to low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. S2, as a soft oxidant, can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2, but the formation of byproducts like CS2 poses a challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP. Future research should focus on developing a structureactivity relationship to rationally design catalysts. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor in hydrogenation reactions is well-documented, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S can reduce overoxidation during ODH. Shorter residence times are required to suppress cracking reactions, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from alkanes. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but conversion is barely affected by catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. Sulfur-based byproducts, including CS2 and sulfur (S8), are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, and CH activation proceeds via a surface sulfur species. Propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2.

1.硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯的过程中，与传统氧化剂相比，已被证明可以提高丙烯产量。然而，使用SO2会导致丙烯产量低，因为在金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物。S2作为一种软氧化剂，可以减少ZrO2上丙烷的过度氧化，但CS2等副产品的形成在设计S2ODHP的高效催化剂时构成了挑战。未来的研究应集中在开发结构活性关系，以合理设计催化剂。硫在氢化反应中作为促进剂或抑制剂的作用在文献中得到了很好的研究，硫化合物如S2和H2S可以减少ODH过程中烷烃和烯烃的过度氧化。需要更短的停留时间来抑制裂解反应，二原子态的硫可能从烷烃中提取氢。S2的存在提高了C3H6的产量和选择性，但催化剂几乎不影响转化率，表明气相反应占主导地位。观察到硫基副产品，包括CS2和硫（S8），在反应器流出物中。丙烯形成的表观活化能随着金属硫键强度的降低而降低，CH活化通过表面硫物种进行。丙烯和H2S的形成导致硫空位，气相S2补充了这些硫空位。
