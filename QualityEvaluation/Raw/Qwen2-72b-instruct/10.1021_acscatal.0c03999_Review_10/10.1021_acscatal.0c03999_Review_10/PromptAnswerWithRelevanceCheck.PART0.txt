Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

[1] "For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."
[2] "However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."
[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."
[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."
[5] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."
[6] "The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in the literature for hydrogenation reactions."
[7] "Sulfur compounds, such as S2 and H2S, have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation of alkanes and olefins during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH)."
[8] "The C3H6 selectivity increases at residence times below 0.5 s, indicating that shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction."
[9] "The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."
[10] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."
[11] "They found that the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metalsulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species."
[12] "The authors proposed that CH activation (RDS) proceeds by a surface sulfur species based on first order dependence on propane."
[13] "Consequently, propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, and gas phase S2 replenishes these sulfur vacant sites."

1.硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面显示出与传统氧化剂相比提高丙烯产量的潜力。然而，使用SO2会导致低丙烯产量，因为大量金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物。使用软氧化剂如S2可以减少ZrO2上丙烷的过度氧化。设计高效S2ODHP催化剂时，CS2等副产品的形成是一个重大挑战。未来的研究应集中在开发结构活性关系，以合理设计该领域的催化剂。硫化合物如S2和H2S已被用作辅助催化剂，以减少ODH期间的过度氧化。需要更短的停留时间来抑制裂解反应。S2的存在提高了C3H6的产量和选择性，但催化剂几乎不影响转化率，表明气相反应占主导地位。在反应器流出物中观察到硫基副产品的形成。丙烯形成的表观活化能随着金属硫键强度的降低而降低，表明硫物种的活性更高。CH活化通过表面硫物种进行。丙烯和H2S的形成导致硫空位，而气相S2补充了这些硫空位。
