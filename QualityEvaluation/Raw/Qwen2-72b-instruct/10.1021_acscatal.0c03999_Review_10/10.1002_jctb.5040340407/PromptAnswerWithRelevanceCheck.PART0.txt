Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1. The document does not provide a comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It only discusses the effect of sulfur dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane over a palladium-alumina catalyst. The presence of sulfur dioxide increases the overall rate of propane conversion, but the selectivity to propylene formation decreases considerably. The effluent from the reaction also contains carbon dioxide, suggesting that the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidized to CO2 and H2O.

1. 文件没有比较不同的硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯中的效果。它只讨论了二氧化硫在钯-氧化铝催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的影响。二氧化硫的存在增加了丙烷转化的总速率，但丙烯的形成选择性显著降低。反应的流出物中也含有二氧化碳，表明初始丙烷反应可能不具选择性，或者部分丙烯产物可能被氧化为CO2和H2O。
