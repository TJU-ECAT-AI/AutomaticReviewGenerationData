J .  Chem. Tech. Biotechnol. 1984,34A, 183-186 Kinetic Investigations of the Reaction of Propane with Sulphur Dioxide on a Palladium-Alumina Catalyst Fathy M. Ashmawy" Department of Chemistry, The University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester M60 1 Q D (Manuscript received 7 October 1983 and accepted 3 November 1983) Keywords: Propane; catalytic dehydrogenation; effect of sulphur dioxide; palladium- alumina catalyst.
A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation. Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature.'-5 Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation.The present communication deals with preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of propane and propane with sulphur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst.

Ashmawy the author's studies of the catalytic behaviour of chromia-alumina and palladium-alumina in propane dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene? potentially important industrial processes. In order to resolve some of the kinetic uncertainties of such processes, the rate dependence on selected partial pressures of propane were studied under controlled conditions.Propane, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur dioxide were high purity products (BOC). Catalyst,containing 0.5% by wt Pd-AI2O3 was supplied by Engelhard (UK) with fairly uniform particles of about 1.6mm in size and surface area of 250 m2 g-'. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a fixed bed flow reactor similar to that used earlier' and at a total pressure of about 100 kPa. The temperature of the reactor was kept constant to within 21
K. The products were analysed by gas
chromatography.The space velocity used was fairly high (600 h-I) and close to industrial rates (the considerable gas flow eliminates the possibility of external diffusion inhibition). The high activation energies and the absence of discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots (Figure 1) indicate that the investigations were carried out in ranges well removed from inter- and intra-diffusion conditions.
The catalyst activity was constant over a period of 3 h before it lost some of its activity owing to coke formation.
Complete regeneration occurred easily with oxygen followed by hydrogen at 773 K.
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K. The effect of propane partial pressure (nitrogen was used as a diluent) on the rate of dehydrogenation to propylene is shown in Figure 2. The results suggest first order kinetics with an

Reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide 185 apparent activation energy of 128 kJ mol-' (Figure 1). This value is lower than those obtained on Pt-AlZ02 (170.1 kJ mol-l) and on chromia-aluminag (141.7 kJ mol-'), suggesting that Pd-AlZO3 is more active in facilitating the breakage of a C-H bond in the propane molecule.The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably. For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SOz.An apparent activation energy of 109.5 kJ mol-' was obtained from Figure 1.The reaction of propane with sulphur dioxide can be written as:3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO (1) a c e

Ashmawy In the present experiments, in addition to HzS and H20, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially. In one experiment the selectivity to propylene formation increased from 14.8 to 20.3% over a period of 50 min.
In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex. The presence of COz,among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO.

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.
