The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. A major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2. Future research should focus on developing a structureactivity relationship to rationally design catalysts in this field. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in hydrogenation reactions, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. Sulfur-based byproducts like CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal-sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species, and propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10"},
