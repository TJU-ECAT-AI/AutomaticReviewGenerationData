Sulfur-based alternative oxidants have emerged as promising candidates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production, offering potential advantages over traditional oxygen and molecular oxygen-based systems. The effectiveness of these oxidants lies in their ability to facilitate the selective conversion of propane to propylene under milder conditions, potentially reducing the energy consumption and operational costs associated with propylene production. Sulfur species, such as SO2 and SO3, can act as electron acceptors, enabling a redox cycle that enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity of metal oxides used in ODHP processes.

However, the utilization of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP is not without challenges. One significant issue is the potential for sulfur poisoning of the catalyst, which can lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity over time. The formation of sulfur-containing byproducts, such as COS and CS2, can also complicate the product separation and purification processes. Moreover, the regeneration of sulfur-based oxidants often requires high temperatures and specific conditions, which can add complexity to the overall process and increase energy requirements.

The design of efficient catalysts that can mitigate these challenges is a critical area of research. Recent studies have focused on developing bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing sulfur poisoning. These catalysts often incorporate metals such as vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten, which have shown promise in promoting the redox cycling of sulfur species and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene. Additionally, the use of solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites and sulfated zirconia, has been explored to improve the stability and activity of sulfur-based ODHP systems.

Future directions in catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP should aim to further enhance the stability and selectivity of the catalysts, while also addressing the challenges associated with sulfur poisoning and oxidant regeneration. The development of novel catalysts with tailored active sites and improved redox properties is essential. Moreover, the integration of sulfur-based ODHP processes with other chemical processes, such as sulfur recovery and valorization, could offer synergistic benefits and improve the overall sustainability of propylene production. The optimization of reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and gas composition, will also be crucial in maximizing the efficiency and economic viability of sulfur-based ODHP technologies.

In conclusion, sulfur-based alternative oxidants present a viable pathway for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, offering potential improvements in selectivity and operational conditions. However, the associated challenges, particularly sulfur poisoning and oxidant regeneration, require innovative catalyst design strategies to fully realize the benefits of these oxidants in industrial applications. Ongoing research in this area holds promise for the development of more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

The potential and challenges of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production have been elucidated in recent studies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. Sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, have demonstrated the ability to enhance propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. SO2, in particular, has been shown to be effective in the selective oxidation of propane to propylene, with the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface accelerating the interaction of propane with SO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. However, the use of SO2 as an oxidant results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. A major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2. Future research should focus on developing a structure-activity relationship to rationally design catalysts in this field \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in hydrogenation reactions, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. Sulfur-based byproducts like CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal-sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species, and propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP presents a promising avenue for improving propylene yield. However, the challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation and overoxidation, must be addressed. Future research should focus on developing catalysts that can optimize the overall process, particularly in the context of S2ODHP, where the formation of byproducts like CS2 poses a significant challenge. Developing a structure-activity relationship will be crucial for rational catalyst design in this field. Moreover, the role of sulfur in promoting or inhibiting reactions during ODHP should be further explored, as sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have shown potential in reducing overoxidation. Shorter residence times and the use of sulfur in the diatomic state may also contribute to suppressing the cracking reaction and improving C3H6 yield and selectivity. The observation of sulfur-based byproducts in the reactor effluent suggests the need for catalysts that can minimize their formation. The decrease in the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation with lower metal-sulfur bond strength indicates the potential for more active sulfur species, which could be harnessed for enhancing propylene yield. CH activation by a surface sulfur species and the replenishment of sulfur vacancies by gas phase S2 highlight the dynamic nature of sulfur in ODHP. Future research efforts should aim to optimize these processes for more efficient propylene production.
