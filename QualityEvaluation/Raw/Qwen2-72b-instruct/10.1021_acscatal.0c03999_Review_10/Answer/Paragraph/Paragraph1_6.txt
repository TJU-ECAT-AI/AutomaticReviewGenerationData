                The potential and challenges of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production have been elucidated through a critical examination of their effectiveness, associated problems, and future directions for catalyst design optimization \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. Sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, have demonstrated the ability to enhance propylene yield in comparison to conventional oxidants. The effectiveness of SO2 in the ODHP process is evidenced by the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, which selectively accelerate the interaction of propane with SO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. However, the use of SO2 results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can mitigate overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. A significant challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well-documented in hydrogenation reactions, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions. Sulfur-based byproducts like CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal-sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species, and propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process has revealed promising avenues for enhancing propylene yield. Future research should focus on developing a structure-activity relationship to rationally design catalysts in this field. The development of catalysts that can optimize the overall process while minimizing byproduct formation, such as CS2, is crucial. Understanding the role of sulfur in the diatomic state as an active species and its interaction with alkanes can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. The investigation of other sulfur-based oxidants and their impact on propylene yield, as well as the development of catalysts that can optimize the overall process, are key areas for future research. The challenge of sulfur vacancy and its replenishment by gas phase S2 should be addressed to improve catalyst stability and performance. The exploration of innovative sulfur-based compounds and their potential as alternative oxidants in the ODHP process could lead to significant advancements in propylene production.

                通过批判性检查它们的有效性、相关问题以及催化剂设计优化的未来方向，硫基替代氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中用于丙烯生产中的潜力和挑战得到了阐明\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]。硫基氧化剂，如H2S、S2和SO2，已证明能够与传统氧化剂相比提高丙烯产量。SO2在ODHP过程中的有效性通过催化剂表面形成氧化缩合产物（OCP）得到证明，这些产物选择性地加速了丙烷与SO2的相互作用\[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]。然而，SO2的使用导致丙烯产量较低，因为在其上形成了COx产物。使用像S2这样的软氧化剂可以减少ZrO2上的丙烷过度氧化。设计高效S2ODHP催化剂的一个重大挑战是形成CS2等副产品\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]。硫作为促进剂或抑制剂的作用在氢化反应中得到了充分的记录，像S2和H2S这样的硫化合物已被用作减少氧化脱氢反应中过度氧化的助催化剂。需要更短的停留时间来抑制裂解反应，而二原子状态的硫可能从烷烃中提取氢。S2的存在提高了C3H6的产量和选择性，但催化剂几乎不影响转化率，表明气相反应占主导地位。像CS2这样的硫基副产品在反应器流出物中被观察到。丙烯形成的表观活化能随着金属硫键强度的降低而降低，表明硫物种更加活跃。CH活化通过表面硫物种进行，丙烯和H2S的形成导致硫空位，这由气相S2补充\[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]。
