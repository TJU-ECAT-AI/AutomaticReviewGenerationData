The potential and challenges of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production have been elucidated in recent studies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. Sulfur-based oxidants, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, have demonstrated the ability to enhance propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. SO2, in particular, has been shown to be effective in the selective oxidation of propane to propylene, with the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface accelerating the interaction of propane with SO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. However, the use of SO2 as an oxidant results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. A major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2. Future research should focus on developing a structure-activity relationship to rationally design catalysts in this field \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well studied in hydrogenation reactions, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. Sulfur-based byproducts like CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal-sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species, and propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP presents a promising avenue for improving propylene yield. However, the challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation and overoxidation, must be addressed. Future research should focus on developing catalysts that can optimize the overall process, particularly in the context of S2ODHP, where the formation of byproducts like CS2 poses a significant challenge. Developing a structure-activity relationship will be crucial for rational catalyst design in this field. Moreover, the role of sulfur in promoting or inhibiting reactions during ODHP should be further explored, as sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have shown potential in reducing overoxidation. Shorter residence times and the use of sulfur in the diatomic state may also contribute to suppressing the cracking reaction and improving C3H6 yield and selectivity. The observation of sulfur-based byproducts in the reactor effluent suggests the need for catalysts that can minimize their formation. The decrease in the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation with lower metal-sulfur bond strength indicates the potential for more active sulfur species, which could be harnessed for enhancing propylene yield. CH activation by a surface sulfur species and the replenishment of sulfur vacancies by gas phase S2 highlight the dynamic nature of sulfur in ODHP. Future research efforts should aim to optimize these processes for more efficient propylene production.

This could involve the investigation of novel catalyst compositions and reaction conditions that promote the selective formation of propylene. Additionally, the role of sulfur in the diatomic state as an active species for hydrogen abstraction from alkanes opens up new possibilities for catalyst design. The development of catalysts that can maintain a high concentration of active sulfur species while minimizing sulfur vacancy could lead to significant improvements in propylene yield. Furthermore, the exploration of other sulfur-based oxidants and their impact on propylene yield could provide valuable insights into the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP. The optimization of residence times to suppress cracking reactions and the investigation of the effects of metal-sulfur bond strength on propylene formation could also contribute to the rational design of catalysts for this process. In summary, the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP is significant, but their effective utilization requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying chemistry and the development of optimized catalysts.

The potential and challenges of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production have been elucidated through a critical examination of their effectiveness, associated problems, and future directions for catalyst design optimization \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. Sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, have demonstrated the ability to enhance propylene yield in comparison to conventional oxidants. The effectiveness of SO2 in the ODHP process is evidenced by the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, which selectively accelerate the interaction of propane with SO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. However, the use of SO2 results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can mitigate overoxidation of propane over ZrO2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. A significant challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor is well established in hydrogenation reactions, and sulfur compounds like S2 and H2S have been used as cocatalysts to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. Shorter residence times are required to suppress the cracking reaction, and sulfur in the diatomic state may abstract hydrogen from an alkane \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, but the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. Sulfur-based byproducts like CS2 are observed in the reactor effluent \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. The apparent activation barrier for propylene formation decreases with lower metal-sulfur bond strength, indicating a more active sulfur species \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\]. CH activation proceeds by a surface sulfur species, and propylene and H2S formation leads to sulfur vacancy, which is replenished by gas phase S2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10\].
                ※※※
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process has revealed promising avenues for enhancing propylene yield. The use of SO2, despite its limitations, has shown potential in forming OCP that selectively accelerate propane interaction. The introduction of soft oxidants like S2 has been beneficial in reducing overoxidation. However, the formation of byproducts such as CS2 presents a significant challenge in catalyst design. Future research should focus on developing a structure-activity relationship to rationally design catalysts that can optimize the overall process. The role of sulfur compounds as cocatalysts in reducing overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions should be further explored. Shorter residence times and the use of sulfur in the diatomic state may offer strategies to suppress cracking reactions. The observation of sulfur-based byproducts in the reactor effluent suggests the need for catalysts that can minimize their formation. The decrease in the activation barrier for propylene formation with lower metal-sulfur bond strength indicates the potential for more active sulfur species. The replenishment of sulfur vacancies by gas phase S2 offers a dynamic aspect to the reaction mechanism. Future directions should aim to optimize catalyst design, investigate the role of different sulfur-based oxidants, and develop strategies to minimize byproduct formation. The development of catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation could lead to significant advancements in the ODHP process for propylene production.
