The potential and challenges of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production have been elucidated in recent studies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. Sulfur-based oxidants, including H2S, S2, and SO2, have demonstrated the ability to enhance propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants. SO2, in particular, has been shown to be effective in the selective oxidation of propane to propylene, with the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface accelerating the interaction of propane with SO2 \[10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8\]. However, the use of SO2 as an oxidant results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. The use of a soft oxidant like S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2, and the presence of S2 improves C3H6 yield and selectivity, although the conversion is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. A major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\]. Future research should focus on developing a structureactivity relationship to rationally design catalysts in this field \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process offers a promising avenue for improving propylene yield. However, the challenges associated with each oxidant, such as byproduct formation and overoxidation, must be addressed. Future research should focus on optimizing catalyst design to enhance the activity and selectivity of OCP towards propylene formation, as well as investigating the role of different sulfur-based oxidants in the ODHP process. Developing a structureactivity relationship will be crucial for rational catalyst design in this field. Additionally, exploring the effectiveness of other sulfur-based oxidants and their impact on propylene yield, as well as the development of catalysts that can optimize the overall process, will be important areas for future research. The role of sulfur as a promoter or inhibitor in hydrogenation reactions, and its use as a cocatalyst to reduce overoxidation during oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, should also be further investigated. Shorter residence times and the use of sulfur in the diatomic state may help to suppress the cracking reaction and abstract hydrogen from an alkane, respectively. Understanding the apparent activation barrier for propylene formation and the role of metal-sulfur bond strength in this process will also be important for improving catalyst design. Finally, the replenishment of sulfur vacant sites by gas phase S2 should be considered in the design of efficient catalysts for the ODHP process.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
Sulfur-based alternative oxidants have emerged as promising candidates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production, offering potential advantages over traditional oxidants. These oxidants, including sulfate and polysulfate species, can enhance selectivity and efficiency in propylene yield, primarily due to their ability to facilitate the formation of active oxygen species under milder conditions. However, their application is not without challenges. One significant issue is the potential for sulfur deposition on the catalyst surface, which can lead to deactivation and reduced performance over time. Moreover, the stability and regeneration of sulfur-based oxidants under reaction conditions require further investigation. To address these challenges, future directions in catalyst design optimization should focus on developing robust catalysts that can mitigate sulfur deposition and enhance the stability of sulfur-based oxidants. This includes the exploration of novel catalyst supports and active sites that can promote the efficient utilization of sulfur species while minimizing their adverse effects. Additionally, advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling can provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help guide the rational design of improved catalysts. Overall, the effective integration of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in ODHP processes holds significant potential for enhancing propylene production, but requires careful consideration of associated problems and strategic catalyst design.
