Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.
