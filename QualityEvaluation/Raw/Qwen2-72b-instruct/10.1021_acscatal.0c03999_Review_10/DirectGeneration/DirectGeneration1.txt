Sulfur-based alternative oxidants have emerged as promising candidates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) for propylene production, offering potential advantages over traditional oxidants. These oxidants, including sulfate and polysulfate species, can enhance selectivity and efficiency in propylene yield, primarily due to their ability to facilitate the formation of active oxygen species under milder conditions. However, their application is not without challenges. One significant issue is the potential for sulfur deposition on the catalyst surface, which can lead to deactivation and reduced performance over time. Moreover, the stability and regeneration of sulfur-based oxidants under reaction conditions require further investigation. To address these challenges, future directions in catalyst design optimization should focus on developing robust catalysts that can mitigate sulfur deposition and enhance the stability of sulfur-based oxidants. This includes the exploration of novel catalyst supports and active sites that can promote the efficient utilization of sulfur species while minimizing their adverse effects. Additionally, advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling can provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help guide the rational design of improved catalysts. Overall, the effective integration of sulfur-based alternative oxidants in ODHP processes holds significant potential for enhancing propylene production, but requires careful consideration of associated problems and strategic catalyst design.
