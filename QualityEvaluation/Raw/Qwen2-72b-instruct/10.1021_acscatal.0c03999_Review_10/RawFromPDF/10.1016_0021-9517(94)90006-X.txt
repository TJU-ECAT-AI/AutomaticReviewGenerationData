We have studied the dehydrogenation ofisobutane to isobutylene 
over heavily sulfided Ni catalysts at 873 K. In the absence of sulfur 
but in the presence of hydrogen, supported metallic nickel catalyzes 
the rapid hydrogenolysis of alkanes, resulting in exceedingly poor 
selectivity toward dehydrogenation products. However, the hydro- 
genolysis activity can be essentially eliminated by proper sulfida- 
tion, resulting in high selectivity toward isobutylene production. 
Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are nec- 
essary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene. Under these 
conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of 
catalyst deactivation. Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively 
large mounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in 
dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of 
coke formation. The catalysts exhibited activation periods of sev- 
eral hours until a maximum was reached when they were placed 
in the reaction environment at 873 K. This activation period did 
not depend upon the previous reduction treatment but did depend 
upon the time on stream. A correlation was found between the 
increase in activity and the growth of a carbidic phase on the 
catalyst. This species, characterized by TPO and XPS, reached a 
saturation value at a C/Ni ratio of unity, which was coincidental 
with the amount of carbon on the catalyst when it achieved its 
maximum activity. Two alternative explanations for the activation 
process are discussed. The first considers the participation of a 
nickel-earbidic-carbon complex in the reaction scheme. The sec- 
ond considers the creation of sulfur vacancies during the initial 
coke deposition period which would increase the exposure of a 
catalytically active Ni-S moiety.

INTRODUCTION 
The increasing demand for certain olefins as chemical 
intermediates for the production of oxygenates and alkyl- 
ates for motor fuels, coupled with the plentiful supply of 
lower alkanes, provides incentive for the use of catalytic 
dehydrogenation on an industrial scale (1). Driven largely 
by the rapid growth in demand for tertiary alkyl ethers, 
the dehydrogenation of isobutane or isopentane to isobu-

tylene or isoamylene, respectively, is receiving renewed 
attention since branched ethers are prepared by etherifi- 
cation of branched olefins with methanol or ethanol. 
The dehydrogenation reaction is currently carried out 
in commercial processes in the vapor phase over chromia- 
alumina or noble-metal catalysts. Due to the endothermic 
nature of this reaction and the normally unfavorable equi- 
librium, elevated process temperatures are necessary to 
reach economically acceptable levels of conversion. 
These severe operating conditions favor coke formation 
and catalyst deactivation. As a consequence, most of the 
commercial processes for dehydrogenation of lower 
alkanes require feeds diluted with hydrogen or steam and 
short reaction cycles with frequent regenerations (I, 2). 
Improved process economics could result from the 
development 
of catalysts 
that 
perform well under 
severely deactivating conditions. 
Previous workers have shown that the addition ofsmall 
amounts of S has beneficial effects on selectivity and 
coke formation. For example, Rennard and Freel (3) have 
shown that sulfur causes an increase in propylene yield 
over Pt-Re catalysts increased upon sulfiding. The effect 
of sulfur in reducing the rate of coke formation has been 
reported by Rostrup-Nielsen and co-workers (5-7, 14, 
over Pt-Re catalysts increased upon sulfiding. The effect 
of sulfur in reducing the rate of coke formation has been 
reported by Rostrup-Nielsen and co-workers (5-7, 14, 
15) for the case of steam reforming of CH4. The presence 
of half a monolayer of sulfur on the Ni surface strongly 
inhibited the rate of carbon deposition, while it did not 
inhibit the rate of steam reforming to the same extent. 
This effect has been explained in terms of the ensemble 
of atoms required to constitute the active site for each 
reaction. The ensemble for the steam reforming reaction 
is smaller than that required for coke formation. Conse- 
quently, although both rates decreased when sulfur was 
added, the coking rate did so almost 10 times faster than 
the reforming rate. 
In this paper, we describe the use of heavily sulfided 
nickel catalysts supported on nonacidic aluminas for the 
dehydrogenation of isobutane. We have demonstrated 
that versions of these catalysts are active and selective

for relatively long reaction times under low hydrogen/ 
hydrocarbon ratios, resulting in an important advantage 
compared to the existing technology. We view the heavily 
sulfided nickel component present in these catalysts as a 
compound with different properties from those of metallic 
nickel rather than as a zero-valent metal modified by the 
presence of chemisorbed sulfur. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
Catalytic Materials 
Table 1 summarizes the differences in the various prep- 
arations reported in this work, i.e., the amount of Ni, the 
amount of Cs, the calcination of the support, and the 
thermal pretreatment of the catalysts. The material used 
as a support for the catalysts reported here was ),-alumina 
(CS331-4 from United Catalysts), ground and sieved to 
18/35 mesh. Before any further treatment, the alumina 
was calcined in air at 1223 K for 10 hr. X-Ray diffraction 
powder patterns of the calcined material revealed a trans- 
formation to the theta phase. During this transformation, 
the BET surface area, as determined by nitrogen adsorp- 
tion conducted in a Coulter Omnisorp 360 instrument, 
changed from 225 m2/g for the fresh material to 130 
m2/g for the calcined support. 
In one of the samples, catalyst D, the precalcination 
treatment was omitted. In another sample, catalyst B, the 
alumina support was treated with a 1.0 M aqueous oxalic 
acid solution for 2 h at 348 K in order to increase the pore 
volume in the 10 to 20 nm pore radius range, as described 
later. To reduce the acidity, each alumina support was 
impregnated with an aqueous solution of CsNO3 using a 
liquid/solid ratio of 0.65 ml/g, and then dried in an oven 
at 423 K. The resulting cesium content was 5 wt% in all 
the samples except for catalyst C, in which it was 3 wt%. 
Loading with Ni was accomplished by incipient wetness 
impregnation using a solution of Ni(NO3h. 6 H20 in ace- 
tone, keeping the liquid/solid ratio at 0.65 ml/g. The vol- 
ume of liquid used corresponds to the total pore volume of 
the calcined support, as measured by nitrogen desorption 
porosimetry. The resulting material was dried in an oven 
at 423 K. The nominal Ni loading was 6 wt% in all the 
samples except in catalyst E in which it was 3 wt%. The 
sulfiding of the samples was done in situ as described 
below. 
Before each run, the catalyst was placed in a packed bed 
reactor and reduced in pure hydrogen with a temperature 
ramp of 3 K/min up to 543 K and held at that temperature 
for two hours then further heated at 3K/min up to 873 K. 
One hour later, the catalyst was presulfided by injecting 
measured quantities of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into 
the preheater section into a hydrogen stream. Unless oth- 
erwise specified, the amount of DMSO injected in each 
case corresponded to a S/bulk Ni molar ratio of I/2. Addi- 
tional sulfiding agents were studied in separate experi- 
ments. 
In one of the samples, catalyst F, the reduction treat- 
ment was omitted and the catalyst was preoxidized at 523 
K before sulfiding. In this case, the sulfiding was done ex 
situ in a quartz reactor in two steps. In the first step, the 
DMSO was added to the oxidized sample at 473 K at a 
S/bulk Ni molar ratio of 1/2. Then the temperature was 
raised to 673 K, followed by a similar injection of DMSO. 
Finally, the catalyst was flashed with hydrogen for 30 
min, purged with nitrogen, passivated in a 1% 02 atmo- 
sphere, and exposed to air. 
For comparison with the sulfided nickel catalysts, an 
unsulfided bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst (catalyst G) was pre- 
pared. This catalyst was prepared by impregnation on the 
same calcined alumina used for the nickel catalysts. The 
addition of Pt was accomplished by incipient wetness 
impregnation using an aqueous solution of hexachloro- 
platinic acid in a 0.65 ml/g liquid to solid ratio, the concen- 
tration of the solution being adjusted to yield a Pt loading 
of 0.35 wt%. The addition of Sn was accomplished by

impregnation with a solution of stannous chloride. The 
acidity of the support was then reduced by addition of 
potassium salts followed by heat treatments. 
Catalyst Characterization 
The catalysts and their precursors were characterized 
by several techniques. The metal dispersions were mea- 
sured prior to sulfiding by temperature programmed de- 
sorption of adsorbed hydrogen in a AMI- I Altamira instru- 
ment after reduction at 873 K for 2 hr and saturation with 
pure hydrogen at 303 K. The data obtained by TPD of 
adsorbed hydrogen were calibrated against the volumetric 
hydrogen uptake measured for one of the samples using 
an Omnisorp 360 operating in static chemisorption mode. 
Once sulfided, an XPS technique described later was used 
to guage relative dispersion of nickel sulfde species. To 
obtain a relative measure of the acidity of the support 
we used TPD of pyridine adsorbed at room temperature 
to saturation. 
The pore size distributions of fresh and spent catalysts 
were determined by a standard nitrogen desorption tech- 
nique in an Omnisorp 360 using a cylindrical pore model. 
The carbon deposits were'analyzed by temperature pro- 
grammed oxidation (TPO) and reduction (TPR) in a quartz 
reactor directly connected to a thermal conductivity de- 
tector and a Hewlett Packard quadrupole mass spectrom- 
eter. The combustion of the carbon deposits was also 
studied in a Dupont 990 Differential Scanning Calorime- 
ter. The coke morphology was investigated by transmis- 
sion electron microscopy (TEM) in a Phillips TEM at the 
University of Delaware. The electron microscope speci- 
mens were prepared from heavily coked samples slurried 
in ultrasonically stirred propanol and deposited on gold 
grids. After evaporating the propanol, the powder was 
well dispersed over the grid. 
The nature of the carbon deposits was further investi- 
gated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The XPS 
studies were conducted using a Kratos Xsami instrument 
equipped with a dual-anode X-ray source and a reactor 
for in situ treatments. Binding energy measurements were 
referenced to Al(2s) = 119.2 eV. Data reduction was 
carried out using the Vision software provided by Kratos. 
XPS was also used to study the effects on the nature and 
dispersion of the Ni-S species of reduction and oxidation 
pretreatments before sulfiding. X-ray diffraction powder 
patterns of the catalysts were obtained on a Scintag Pad 
IV X-ray diffractometer. A commercial software package 
was used to control aquisition and reduction of the data. 
Activity Measurements 
Catalytic activity data were obtained in two different 
reactors. A downflow tubular reactor was used for cata- 
lyst life on-stream studies and a recirculating reactor was 
used for kinetics studies. The tubular reactor had passiv- 
ated stainless steel walls with an internal diameter of ½ 
in. Passivation was accomplished by repeated exposure 
of the empty reactor to H2S, DMSO, and H 2 mixtures at 
873 K prior to activity measurements. The catalyst bed 
volume was constant for all the runs at 17 cmL For runs 
used to study nonsulfided catalysts, nonpassivated reac- 
tors constructed of 316 stainless steel were used. This 
reactor was operated isothermally at 873 K and controlled 
within I K by a temperature controller through a PID 
loop. Isobutane was fed through a liquid metering pump 
into a thermostated, packed preheating chamber. The iso- 
butane gas flow was kept constant at 280 ml/min NTP. 
Hydrogen flow was controlled by a mass flow controller 
and varied from 0 to 560 ml/min NTP. As mentioned 
above, before each run the catalysts were reduced and 
sulfided with DMSO. After sulfiding, the catalyst was left 
under hydrogen at 873 K for an additional 1 hr before the 
introduction of the hydrocarbon feed. The hydrogen to 
hydrocarbon ratio was varied between 0 and 6. After each 
reaction run in the flow reactor, the total amount of carbon 
deposited on the catalyst was determined using a LECO 
carbon analyzer. 
A stainless steel Berty type recirculating reactor from 
Autoclave Engrg. was used to determine kinetics parame- 
ters. The catalyst was held in a basket placed over a stirrer 
which could be operated at different speeds to vary the 
recirculation flow. Flow rates of isobutane, hydrogen, 
and argon were controllect by mass flow controllers. The 
reactor was operated in a differential mode. The total feed 
flow rate was kept constant at 100 ml/min NTP, while the 
recirculation flow rate was 15,000 ml/min NTP. Under 
these conditions, in which the recirculation flow rate was 
much higher than the feed flow rate, the concentration of 
reactants and products was essentially constant and the 
reactor could be considered a continuous stirred tank 
(8). In order to obtain reaction orders with respect to 
isobutane and hydrogen, the individual flow rates were 
varied while the total flow rate was kept constant. To 
determine activation energies, the temperature was varied 
from 823 to 703 K. As in the case of the flow reactor, 
before each run, the catalysts were reduced at 873 K 
for 1 hr and then sulfided by injecting DMSO into the 
hydrogen stream. 
R~ites of carbon formation were also obtained in this 
reactor. In those experiments, gaseous streams of isobu- 
tane, isobutylene, and hydrogen, controlled by mass flow 
controllers, were continuously co-fed into the stirred tank 
reactor at 873 K and a total flow rate of 100 ml/min NTP. 
After a given time in contact with a particular gaseous 
mixture, the reactor was cooled in Ar, and the amount 
of carbon on the catalyst was measured by the LECO 
method. 
Reaction products from both reactors were analyzed

off line in a gas chromatograph. Selected gas samples 
were analyzed by GC-MS. The data fi'om both analytical 
methods were in excellent agreement, and the reproduc- 
ibility of the data obtained from different runs on the same 
sample was within 10%. The steady state conditions of 
the feed were reached in less than 15 rain, but as described 
below, the catalysts exhibited activation periods of sev- 
eral hours before achieving their maximum activity.

Effec! of Adding S to Ni Catalysts 
In one of the Ni/Cs-AI203 samples, catalyst A, we 
varied the amount of sulfur injected before the reaction 
run and studied the consequential catalytic performance 
in the flow reactor. We observed, at 873 K, that the re- 
duced but unsulfided Ni catalyst exposed to a 0.5 HJ 
isobutane feed produced only methane and coked rapidly. 
On the other hand, as increasing amounts of DMSO were 
added to the prereduced Ni catalyst, both the hydrogen- 
olysis and coking rates drastically decreased. As shown 
in Fig. 1, the carbon content measured after 10 hr on 
stream at 873 at a HJisobutane ratio of 0.5 dropped from 
almost 9 g C/g cat for the unsulfided Ni catalyst to almost 
0 for catalyst exposed to a S/Ni ratio greater than 0.25. 
Likewise, the carbon molar selectivity towards methane 
decreased from 100% to less than 4%. 
Although some weakly bound S-containing species may 
have desorbed after catalysts had been sulfided with 
DMSO then exposed to hydrogen, most of the S clearly 
remained on the catalyst. Analysis of one sample which 
had been subjected to a single sulfiding with DMSO at

the start of the run indicated a residual sulfur to nickel 
ratio of 0.2 after 336 hr on stream. During the course of 
a separate experiment (using a catalyst with a lower nickel 
loading) in which H2S had been used as a sulfiding agent 
and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio increased to 6, S 
content noticeably dropped after only 10 h on stream. In 
this case, the time dependent product distribution was 
characterized by a loss of selectivity (increase in methane) 
with time. Such rapid selectivity loss was never observed 
when DMSO was used as a sulfiding agent and the hydro- 
gen to hydrocarbon ratio was kept at 2 or less. 
Activity Variation as a Function of Time on Stream 
The evolution of activity of the sulfided Ni catalysts 
was studied in the fixed-bed flow reactor under various 
conditions. For example, a series of reactions were car- 
ried out at 873 K using a gas hourly space velocity of 
1330 hr -~. Before starting each reaction, the catalysts 
were prereduced and sulfided at 873 K. The sulfiding 
agent, DMSO, was injected into the H 2 stream at a S/Ni 
molar ratio of 1/2. 
Figure 2 illustrates the variation of the dehydrogenation 
reaction rate over catalyst A studied during a 24 hr reac- 
tion period. Over the course of the initial hours on stream, 
the conversion increased with time while the carbon selec- 
tivity toward isobutylene remained essentially constant 
at above 90%. It must be noted that this induction period, 
during which the catalyst activity increased, was observed 
for all the sulfided nickel catalysts investigated. It only 
occurred during the initial reaction run and after regenera- 
tion in air followed by rereduction and sulfiding. It did 
not occur when the reaction was stopped, left overnight 
in hydrogen at the same temperature, and then restarted.

evolution patterns displayed by the sulfided nickel cata- 
lysts, no activation period and a continuous deactivation 
were observed with the Pt catalyst. 
Effect of Varying the Hydrogen~Hydrocarbon 
Feed Ratio 
The kinetics parameters obtained on catalyst E for the 
dehydrogenation of isobutane are summarized in Table 
2. The reaction order with respect to isobutane was found 
to be about 1 while the order with respect to hydrogen 
was 0. The activation energy, was 30 --- 3 kcal/mole. We 
have studied the effect of the H2/hydrocarbon ratio on 
both initial activity and deactivation rate. As shown in 
Fig. 3, due to the first order dependence of the reaction 
with the concentration of isobutane, the dehydrogenation 
rate decreased with an increase in the H2/hydrocarbon 
ratio since the concentration of isobutane became diluted 
with hydrogen. On the other hand, the deactivation rate,

rable conversion levels, was not very sensitive to the 
hydrogen concentration. It only increased when the H2/ 
hydrocarbon ratios were close to 0. 
By taking the ratio between the initial dehydrogenation 
and deactivation rates, a performance parameter can be 
obtained. The H2/hydrocarbon ratio at which this parame- 
ter is maximum would represent the optimum run condi- 
tions. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the optimal operating condi- 
tions in the case of sulfided nickel catalysts would be at 
a HJisobutane ratio of about 0.5. 
This behavior contrasts with that of a typical supported 
metallic Pt catalyst, for which the deactivation rate is 
always a strong function of the hydrogen concentration 
because the coke deposited over the Pt particles can be 
partially removed by reaction with hydrogen (9-I 1). Over 
a typical Pt-based dehydrogenation catalyst the rate of 
dehydrogenation has a negative half order with respect 
to hydrogen while the rate of deactivation is usually in- 
versely proportional to the hydrogen concentration. 
Therefore, the performance ratio defined above would 
continuously 
increase as a function of 
the HJhydrocarbon 
ratio over a supported Pt catalyst. As discussed below, 
we ascribe these differences to the disparate nature of the 
coke deposits and their re~ictivity towards hydrogen over 
the two types of catalysts. That is, we propose that al- 
though over Pt catalysts the coke deposits are more easily 
removed by Hz, they result in greater deactivation than 
over sulfided nickel catalysts. 
Effect of Preoxidation of the Catalysts before Sulfiding 
We found that the reduction step prior to sulfidation was 
not necessary to obtain an active and selective catalyst. 
Actually, as shown in Table 3, a higher activity was ob- 
served when the catalyst had been oxidized before sulfi- 
dation. When we compared a catalyst prereduced in H2 
at 873 K for 1 hr and then sulfided with DMSO in H 2 
(catalyst A) with the same material preoxidize 
d in 4% 05 
in He at 623 K and then sulfided with DMSO in H2 
(catalyst F), we observed that the preoxidized catalyst 
was more active. We ascribe this activity enhancement 
to a better dispersion of the nickel sulfide resulting from 
the preoxidation treatment in comparison with the prere-

duction. Our hydrogen chemisorption measurements on 
nonsulfided samples showed that the dispersion of Ni on 
the Cs-alumina support rapidly decreased during the first 
minutes of reduction in hydrogen at 873 K. By contrast, 
when the reduction at 873K was eliminated, a significantly 
higher dispersion of the sulfided Ni was achieved. 
Figure 4 shows the XPS spectra of the S(2p) region for 
catalyst A (Fig. 4a) and catalyst F (Fig. 4b). The pair 
of peaks at BE = 159.5 and 169.2 eV are attributed to 
Cs(4p3 
n) and Cs(4pt/2), respectively, while the peaks at 
170.5 and 162.3 eV are attributed to S(2p) of SO4- and 
S 
2- species, respectively. A more quantitative compari- 
son appears in Table 3 which shows the XPS Ni(2p3n)/ 
Al(2s) and S2-/AI(2s) ratios. These ratios indicate that 
the dispersion of Ni and S species is significantly higher 
on catalyst F, which exhibited the higher activity, than 
on catalyst A. The concentration of catalytically active 
species in catalyst F also may be greater than in catalyst 
A as indicated by the increase in the S 
2-/Al(2s) ratio. 
Rates of Carbon Formation 
The rate of carbon deposition was measured in the 
Betty reactor on sulfided Ni catalysts under various condi- 
tions. Table 4 shows a comparison of the rates of carbon 
formation on sulfided Ni/Cs-alumina, catalyst E, at 873 
K for H:-isobutane and H2-isobutylene gaseous mix- 
tures. In agreement with the observed profiles in the flow 
reactor, the rate of carbon formation from isobutylene 
was much higher than that from isobutane. Under H2-iso- 
butane-isobutylene mixtures, the rate was roughly first 
order in the concentration of isobutylene. This depen- 
dence is shown in Fig. 5. These results suggest that the 
coke formation on these catalysts is mainly due to the 
dehydrogenation product, isobutylene, and does not 
strongly depend on the hydrogen concentration. 
The observed coke profiles in the catalyst bed further 
support this conclusion. The concentration of deposited 
carbon on catalyst A at 873 K was measured at various 
positions in a fixed-bed flow reactor. The profile obtained 
after a reaction period of 10 h is depicted in Fig. 6 and 
shows that the deposition of coke increased with the dis- 
tance from the inlet. This type of profile is typically ob- 
served in packed bed flow reactors when the coke precur- 
sor is the product. 
The first order rate expression was used to compare 
the coking characteristics of the different catalysts investi-

gated. As illustrated in Table 5, the integrated values of 
the coking rate constants obtained during different runs 
on catalysts A and C are compared as a function of time 
on stream. Catalyst A, which was calcined and contained 
5% Cs, exhibited a coking rate constant of about I0 (mg 
C/g cat. min)/(mol/l). This rate constant is more than 
four orders of magnitude lower than those obtained with 
unsulfided Ni catalysts. 
Much smaller but still significant differences in the cok- 
ing rates were obtained within the sulfided Ni series. For 
example, the coking rate constant on catalyst A was about 
one order of magnitude lower than on catalyst C, which 
only contained 3% Cs, and catalyst D, which was not 
precalcined. Furthermore, the coking rate constant for 
catalyst A did not vary as a function of time on stream 
while it rapidly decreased for catalysts C and D. We as- 
cribe these differences to the acidity of the alumina sup- 
port. Table 5 also shows the relative acidity as determined 
from TPD profiles of adsorbed pyridine for the three sam- 
ples. It is clear that residual acidity on catalysts C and D 
was significantly higher than on catalyst A. 
In addition to the differences in coking rates, this differ- 
ence in residual acidity resulted in important differences 
in catalyst performance. The experiments reported in Ta- 
ble 5 demonstrated that catalyst A, for which the support 
acidity was minimal, exhibited high selectivy towards iso- 
butylene. By contrast, catalysts C and D, on which we 
detected residual acidity, showed much lower selectivities 
due to contributions of cracking and isomerization prod- 
ucts. At the same time, the residualacidity seemed to

have had a detrimental effect on catalyst life, Due to the 
increased rate of coke formation, the catalysts registering 
acidity deactivated much more rapidly than those with 
no residual acidity. The observed rapid decline in the rate 
of carbon deposition in catalysts C and D as a function 
of time can also reasonably be ascribed to carbon blocking 
of the acid sites. 
The particle size of the nickel species also had an effect 
on the rate of coke formation. As described above, the 
preoxidized and sulfided catalyst, F, displayed a much 
more highly dispersed nickel sulfide component than the 
prereduced and sulfided catalyst, A. Not only was catalyst 
F more active, as shown in Table 3, but it also formed 
coke at a lower rate than did catalyst A.

those containing relatively large amounts of carbon had 
a heat of combustion of about 90 kcal/mol of C. The latter 
value is equivalent to the heat of combustion of graphite, 
while the former may indicate that the coke contains some 
H associated with the carbon. In agreement with these 
results, the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples con- 
taining carbon deposits in concentrations above 10 wt% 
indicated the presence of graphite. 
To further characterize the nature of the carbon depos- 
its, we used the method of temperature programmed reac- 
tion (with oxygen, TPO, and with hydrogen, TPR) on 
several coked samples. The TPO profiles of this series, 
measured by monitoring the quadrupole mass selective 
detector signal corresponding to carbon dioxide as a func- 
tion of temperature, are shown in Fig. 8. Two distinct 
CO, peaks resulting from the combustion of the carbon 
deposits were observed at 730-750 K and 860 K, in close 
correlation with the DSC data. We believe that they corre- 
spond to different states of carbon on the catalyst (carbon 
I and carbon II, respectively). 
To quantify the amount of carbon in each state, we 
fitted the experimental data with a rate expression which 
is first order in the amount of unburned carbon and used 
the activation energy and the relative carbon density in 
each state as adjustable parameters. The oxygen con- 
sumption was small in comparison to the oxygen concen-

low carbon contents, both states increased simultane- 
ously, but when the total amount of carbon reached about 
2-3 wt%, the carbon I state seemed to saturate while the 
carbon II state continued to increase. The saturation value 
of the carbon I (about 1 wt%) corresponds to a C/Ni molar 
ratio near unity. It is noteworthy that when this saturation 
value was reached, the catalyst exhibited its maximum 
dehydrogenation activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the maxi- 
mum activity of catalyst A in the flow reactor occurred 
at about 9 hr on stream. From the kinetics data of coke 
formation, the amount of carbon deposited on that cata- 
lyst at any time can be readily calculated. In this case, 
we used a reaction constant of 10 (mg C) (g cat min) -1 
(mol/1)-1 and assumed a linear increase in the isobutylene 
concentration with time during the activation period. Un- 
der these conditions the estimated total amount of carbon 
on the catalyst after 9 hr on stream would be 2.7 wt%, 
nearly the same amount of total carbon at which the satu- 
ration of the carbon I was reached. This correspondence 
suggests that the catalytic induction may be related to the 
formation of the carbon I state. 
To determine the amount of hydrogen associated with 
the C in the coke, we measured the I-I20 evolved during 
the combustion of the carbonaceous deposits. The evolu- 
tion of H20 as a function of temperature is depicted in 
Fig. 10. The amount of H20 evolved was very small in 
comparison to the amount of CO2; it appeared at relatively 
low temperatures; and it did not increase with an increase 
in the content of carbon. As a consequence, the H/C ratio 
in the carbonaceous deposits of the catalyst containing 
2.8 wt% C was about 0.2, while it only was 0.04 in the 
case of the catalyst containing 14.7 wt% C. 
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to 
identify the different carbonaceous species present in the 
coke. As shown in Fig. 11 the XPS spectra show two 
different carbon states on the catalysts with low amounts 
of coke but essentially one dominant feature when the 
amount of carbon deposited becomes large. In the first 
case, the two carbon states can be ascribed to carbidic 
carbon (282 eV) and partially hydrogenated carbon spe- 
cies, CH 
x (285 eV). The dominant feature at high carbon 
contents can be described as graphitic carbon (283 eV). 
These results are in agreement with the XRD, TPO, and 
DSC data that show that on the lightly coked catalyst the

carbon contains some hydrogen and is more reactive, 
while on the more heavily coked samples the carbon con- 
tains almost no hydrogen and is refractory and graphitic 
in nature. 
Filamentous carbon deposits were observed by TEM 
on coked catalysts containing more than 20 wt% C. As 
previously observed by other authors (12), some of the 
filaments had a rather uniform shape and contained a high 
contrast particle at their end. The second type of filament 
observed was less uniform and seemed to grow in 
branches from an initially common filament. These types 
of filaments have been typically observed on heavily sul- 
tided catalysts (13-15). Figure 12 illustrates the two differ- 
ent types of filaments.

(29 wt% C) is shown in Fig. 13. Two main peaks were 
observed: a small peak at 540 K and a larger one at about 
1090 K. It is interesting to note that the amount of carbon 
that may be removed from the catalyst with hydrogen is 
small; the LECO measurements indicated that the carbon 
left on the catalyst after the TPR experiment was 90% of 
the initial amount. This result demonstrates the refractory 
nature of the carbon deposits toward hydrogen, which 
contrasts with a much higher reactivity observed on unsul- 
tided Ni catalysts. For example, McCarty et al. (16) have 
found that filamentous carbon deposited on unsulfided 
Ni/AI203 catalysts readily reacts with pure H2 in the tem-

perature range 700-1000 K, with a maximum reaction rate 
at 875 K. When considered along with the activity data, 
which show only a weak dependence of the deactivation 
rate on the hydrogen/isobutane ratio (see Fig. 3), these 
results show that there is little benefit in life characteristics 
to be gained by increasing the partial pressure of feed hy- 
drogen. 
Catalyst Deactiuation hy Pore Plugging 
Although the buildup of carbon deposits is slow on 
sulfided nickel catalysts, when the amount of carbon be- 
comes large we have observed evidence fox" 
pore plugging 
corresponding to catalyst deactivation. As shown in Fig. 
14, in the particular case of the catalyst A, that situation 
started when the amount of carbon reached 5 wt% C. At 
that point, the pore volume in the size range 10-20 nm 
started to decrease while that in the small pore range 
increased due to the development of porosity of the car- 
bon deposits. 
The effect of pore structure of the support on catalyst 
life can be observed by comparing the deactivation pat- 
terns of catalysts A and B. The pore size distributions of 
the two samples are compared in Fig. 15. Catalyst B, 
prepared using a support which had been subjected to a 
leaching treatment with a solution of oxalic acid, exhibited 
a much larger median pore diameter than the standard 
catalyst A. This difference in pore structure resulted in 
an important improvement in catalyst life. As shown in 
Fig. 16, catalyst B presented a much lower rate of deacti- 
vation than catalyst A when compared at the same initial 
conversions. It must be noted that on catalyst B the de- 
crease in pore volume in the 10-20 nm range only started 
when the amount of carbon reached about 10 wt%. Both 
samples exhibited about the same metal dispersion 
(H/Ni = 0.35) after reduction at 873 K and prior to sulfi- 
dation. Therefore, the difference in deactivation rate was 
not related to a different particle size of the sulfided Ni 
species that would result in a different rate of carbon 
formation but rather to an increase in the coke tolerance 
of catalyst B. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
We have demonstrated that sulfided Ni catalysts can 
be very selective and stable for the dehydrogenation of 
isobutane. These catalysts exhibit some unique character- 
istics which influence both the course of the dehydrogena- 
tion reaction and the mechanism of their deactivation. It 
is interesting to note that under the same reaction condi- 
tions, but without sulfiding, the supported Ni catalysts 
described here only produce methane due to the high 
activity of Ni for hydrogenolysis. In addition to its effect 
on hydrogenolysis, sulfur has a twofold effect with regard 
to coke formation. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 1, 
it drastically reduces the rate of carbon deposition. But, 
on the other hand, as demonstrated in the TPR experi- 
ments, it also reduces the rate of carbon gasification by 
hydrogen. Therefore, on sulfided nickel catalysts there is 
no advantage to increasing the concentration of hydrogen 
in the feed beyond a relatively low level. 
Dehydrogenation Reaction Mechanisms 
An important question to address is whether the selec- 
tivity improvement after sulfiding is simply due to the 
supression of side reactions or rather to the generation 
of new dehydrogenation sites. We recall the tenet that 
hydrogenolysis of alkanes over metals is a structure sensi- 
tive reaction and requires a large ensemble of atoms to 
constitute the active site, while dehydrogenation over 
metals is structure insensitive and does not require a large 
ensemble. Some authors have even proposed that this 
reaction can occur on a single metal atom site [17]. 
At low dosage levels, S binds very strongly to the sur- 
face of Ni. it has been shown (18) that the heat of forma- 
tion of chemisorbed S on Ni is more negative than the 
heat of formation of the most stable bulk sulfide Ni3S 
2. 
This energy difference generates a driving force for the 
segregation of sulfur to the surface and, consequently, 
for the stabilization of sulfided nickel surfaces. Surface 
science studies (19) on well characterized single crystals 
have identified distinct S/Ni patterns in which the chemi- 
sorbed S occupies fourfold hollow sites. 
Several authors have reported the effect of S on the 
catalytic and chemisorptive properties of Ni single crys- 
tals. The presence of S greatly reduces the saturation 
coverage of hydrogen on Ni surfaces (20). This change 
has been ascribed to a steric hindrance to hydrogen re- 
combination rather than to a modification of the electronic 
structure induced by the adsorbate. In like manner, it has 
been proposed that the main effect of S on the adsorption 
of CO (23) or of methane (24) is caused by simple site 
blocking. Similar decreases in saturation coverage and 
desorption kinetics parameters have been observed for 
other foreign species on the surface such as carbon (21, 
22). 
Based on this premise alone it would be reasonable to 
expect that partial blocking of the surface should signifi- 
cantly improve the selectivity towards dehydrogenation 
at the expense of hydrogenolysis. However, in the studies 
cited above, the S/Ni system could be described as a metal 
surface partially poisoned by the presence of adsorbed S. 
In the catalysts of the type described herein the sulfidation 
depth is much greater and most of the Ni is in the +2 
oxidation state. The behavior of the highly sulfided nickel 
catalysts of this study is best explained by regarding the 
surface which is catalytically active and selective towards 
dehydrogenation ofalkanes no't simply as a modified zero- 
52 
RESASCO ET AL. 
valent metal but as a discrete stoichiometric compound 
with quite different catalytic properties from those of dis- 
persed metallic nickel. In fact, we have demonstrated that 
the reduction of Ni is not a prerequisite for obtaining 
active and selective catalysts. Therefore, we propose that 
differences among various catalyst preparations in our 
study are largely related to the degree of formation and 
surface exposure of this compound and that the catalytic 
cycle may require the intimate participation of ligands on 
nickel atoms as hydrogen transfer sites. 
The analysis of the activation periods observed on the 
sulfided Ni/Cs-AI,O3 catalysts suggests that a mode of 
action other than that observed over clean metallic sur- 
faces is favored and may shed fight into the nature of the 
active phase. The activity increase in the inchoative stages 
of the reaction only is observed when the initial level of 
conversion is high. This may suggest that the activation 
period is caused by the interaction of the product, isobu- 
tylene, with the sulfided surface. The saturation behavior 
observed in the TPO experiments further suggests that 
the maximum of activity is achieved when the concentra- 
tion of the more reactive carbon I state reaches its maxi- 
mum. This behavior contrasts sharply to that of unsulfided 
Pt catalysts (see Fig. 2), implying a difference in mecha- 
nism over these different surfaces. 
Activation periods such as those reported in this study 
are common in heterogeneous catalysis (25). Some possi- 
ble causes of activation proposed in the literature are the 
formation of active carbon species (26-30), the increase 
in active surface area (31), and the creation of surface 
defects (32). One or more of these might contribute to the 
activation behavior exhibited by the sulfided Ni catalysts. 
Consider first that an active carbon species, such as 
the carbidic carbon produced by the decomposition of 
isobutylene during the activation period, might participate 
in the catalytic reaction cycle. Fujimoto and co-workers 
(28-30), studying the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane 
and isopentane on carbon-supported metal catalysts, have 
proposed that carbon may play a direct role in the dehy- 
drogenation reaction. They suggest that the alkane activa- 
tion takes place on the carbon itself and the role of the 
metal is to act as a port for releasing the hydrogen pro- 
duced. Thomson and Webb (33) also have proposed a 
mechanism in which carbonaceous species on the surface 
participate in the active site as hydrogen transfer agents. 
One elaboration of these ideas would be that the alkane 
be activated on a Ni atom site while a bound carbon ligand 
(carbidic C) may act as an acceptor of hydrogen released 
during the dissociative adsorption. The formation of the 
nickel-carbidic C species may occur during the activation 
period and the maximum activity then would be reached 
when the nickel-carbon species approached its maximum 
concentration. The saturation value of such a moiety, as 
observed in our TPO experiments (identified as the carbon

unity in the catalysts of interest here. 
However attractive the evocation of such an organo- 
metallic species may be as an explanation of the nature 
of the catalytic cycle, it does not account for the role of 
sulfur in the system. An alternative mechanism that would 
explain both the observed activation period and also the 
role of sulfur may be represented as follows. Initial sulfid- 
ing probably results in the formation of a nickel sulfide

surface compound. A modification of the sulfided nickel 
surface by interaction with isobutylene could result in 
the creation of sulfur vacancies on the surface thereby 
increasing the coordinative unsaturation of S-ligated Ni 
during the activation period. A similar sequence has been 
suggested by Takeuchi et al. (34, 35), who have observed 
that sulfided Ni is initially inactive for olefin hydrogena- 
tion and Hz-D 2 exchange but becomes active after being 
in contact with acetylene. 
Based on this idea, we propose a catalytic cycle as 
depicted in Scheme I. The active species containing coor- 
dinatively unsaturated Ni-S sites would be formed by 
interaction with the reaction mixture, perhaps through 
the intermediacy of a labile nickel-carbidic species. Once 
formed, the three-coordinate Ni-S entity would be able 
to dissociatively adsorb isobutane, leaving the H bonded 
to a sulfur atom. By/3-hydrogen radical transfer, a second 
H could combine with the one at the bound sulfur site, 
leading to the evolution of molecular hydrogen into the 
gas phase and the generation of a 7r-bonded alkene inter- 
mediate. In the final step, the olefin would desorb, regen- 
erating the active site. This scheme would account for 
the observed activation period, the first order dependence 
on isobutane, and the zero order dependence on hydrogen 
concentration observed for dehydrogenation. 
Alternatively, the dominant site of the resting state 
could be pictured as already containing a S-bound H atom, 
Scheme II. The persistence of this surface entity might 
be further bolstered by an agostic interaction of the S- 
bound hydrogen with the nickel atom (36, 37). This resting 
state species would favor a concerted release of H2 and 
o--bonding of the alkane followed by formation of a ~r- 
bonded alkene. 
53 
It is less likely that the catalytic cycle directly involves 
a nickel hydride species (Scheme III) since dehydrogena- 
tion mechanisms based on such hydrides would be ex- 
pected to display a negative reaction order with respect 
to the hydrogen partial pressure, which was not ob- 
served here. 
Catalyst Deactivation 
The stability of these catalysts is related to the nature of 
the interaction of the sulfided nickel with coke precursors. 
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the 
global mechanism of coke formation on the sulfided nickel 
catalysts is similar to that on unsulfided nickel, but at a 
much lower rate. It must be noted that in this case the 
level of sulfur present on the catalyst is significantly higher 
than in many other studies in which the system was con- 
sidered as a zero-valent metal partially covered by sulfur. 
In those cases the rate of coke formation is not so greatly 
reduced and in some cases it may even increase (13). 
Although several types of coke can be differentiated 
by their location, their physical form, and their hydrogen 
contents, all cokes seem to have a common precursor: 
the process of carbon deposition is initiated largely by the 
decomposition of isobutylene, which is the main source 
of coke, as demonstrated by the experiments described 
above. During the initial stages of carbon deposition, car- 
bidic and partially hydrogenated carbon species could 
form on the sulfided nickel particles. A surprising charac- 
teristic of these catalysts is that the process of deposition 
of the initially formed carbonaceous species does not re- 
sult in any decrease in the dehydrogenation activity but 
rather in an increase as described above. 
When carbon content reaches high levels, formation of 
filamentous carbon is observed. The most widely ac- 
cepted physical mechanism for the formation of carbon 
filaments on metallic Ni catalysts involves the decomposi- 
tion of the hydrocarbon on the surface followed by bulk 
diffusion of carbon through the metallic crystallite and 
precipitation at the rear end, possibly at a crystal disloca- 
tion, leaving the active surface exposed but connected to 
a long filament (12, 38). Unless a graphitic sheath com- 
pletely encapsulates the particle, the catalytic surface re- 
mains active during the entire cycle of carbon formation. 
Although perhaps differing in the detail of how chemical 
intermediates leading to highly dehydrogenated coke are 
formed, we propose that a similar gross physical mecha- 
nism is active on sulfided nickel for carbon filament forma- 
tion as proposed for metallic nickel (14, 15). This charac- 
teristic may account, in part, for the relatively high 
stability of these catalysts under severely deactivating 
conditions. However, the formation of carbon filaments 
would eventually result in deactivation by plugging of 
the porous support. To overcome this problem we have 
54 
RESASCO ET AL. 
modified the pore structure in a way that improved cata- 
lyst life by reducing the tendency toward pore plugging 
(see Fig. 16). 
The mechanism of coke formation is an important dif- 
ference exhibited by sulfided nickel catalysts in compari- 
son with unsulfided Pt catalysts. On Pt catalysts, it is 
necessary to operate at relatively high H2/hydrocarbon 
ratios in order to keep the metal surface clean of carbon 
deposits. It has been shown that small amounts of coke 
may cover a large fraction of the metal surface making it 
unavailable to reactants. For example, on a 0.1 wt% Pt/ 
A1203 catalyst, a C/Pt molar ratio of 1.0 is enough to 
render half of the total metallic surface area unaccesible 
(39). By contrast, on the sulfided nickel catalysts de- 
scribed here, the maximum activity is reached when the 
C/Ni molar ratio is about 1.0. 
Some of the commercially utilized isobutane dehydro- 
genation catalysts (40-42) are based on Pt and their rate 
of coke formation is strongly affected by the H2/hydrocar- 
bon ratio. The addition of metal promoters such as Sn to 
the Pt catalysts significantly improves the tolerance to 
coke. As shown by Lin et al. (43), the same level of carbon 
deposition that causes a deactivation of 90% of the metal 
surface in an unpromoted Pt catalyst only causes a 70% 
deactivation in a Sn-promoted one. On a Pt-Sn catalyst 
the migration of the carbon deposits from the metal to 
the support would be easier than on an unpromoted Pt 
catalyst, which would help to reduce the amount of carbon 
left on the metal. However, as described by Loc et al. 
(9), the process of clearing the metal particles requires the 
use of hydrogen. As a consequence, even the promoted Pt 
catalysts (40-42) require higher dilution ratios than the 
ones at which the sulfided nickel catalysts operate best. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have studied the dehydrogenation of isobutane to 
isobutylene over sulfided Ni catalysts. Treatment of 
nickel catalysts with sulfur-containing reagents resulted 
in dramatically improved selectivity and decreased rates 
of coke formation. By proper sulfiding, adjusting the pore 
structure, and reducing the acidity of the support, very 
active, selective, and stable catalysts were obtained. 
These catalysts were able to operate for relatively long 
reaction periods without regeneration under very low hy- 
dr0gen/hydrocarbon ratios. The use of the sulfided Ni 
catalysts at low hydrogen feed content in commercial 
dehydrogenation processes might result in a new techno- 
logical alternative which could effect improved economics 
based on reduction of compression requirements and 
higher equilibrium conversions. 
The catalysts exhibited induction periods in activity of 
several hours until a maximum was reached. Two alterna- 
tive explanations for the activation process were dis- 
cussed. The first one considers the participation of a 
nickel-carbidic C complex in the reaction scheme. The 
second one considers the creation of sulfur vacancies 
during the initial coke deposition period which would in- 
crease the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety. 
From the point of view of practical applications it is 
worth noting that particular preparations of sulfided nickel 
catalysts can remain on stream for several days under 
severely deactivating conditions of low H2/hydrocarbon 
ratios and high temperatures, yet still be highly active for 
dehydrogenation.
