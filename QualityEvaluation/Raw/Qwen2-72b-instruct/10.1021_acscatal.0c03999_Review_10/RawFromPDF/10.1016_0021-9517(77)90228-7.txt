Cutalytic 
Oxidative 
Dehydrogenation 
of Propane 
to Propylene 
The present 
work 
is an investigation 
of 
the 
system 
propane-sulfur 
dioxide 
over 
I’d/A1203 
catalyst 
in 
the 
reduced 
and 
sulfided states. 
Pd/ALOs 
was 
chosen because 
of the re- 
markable 
high 
yield 
and 
selectivity 
to 
propylene 
formation 
resulting 
from the de- 
hydrogenation 
of propane 
(1). 
The overall reaction 
for the deyhdrogen- 
ation 
of propane 
to propylene 
with 
SO2 
can be written 
as 
3CJZ3 + so2 * 
3GHs 
+ H&J + 2HzO. 
Previous 
studies 
(2) have shown 
that 
the 
above 
reaction 
is endothermic 
and that 
Kp increases 
with 
temperature. 
Propane, 
hydrogen, 
nitrogen, 
oxygen, 
sulfur 
dioxide 
and hydrogen 
sulfide 
were 
high purity 
products. 
Catalyst, 
containing 
0.50/, wt Pd/A1203 
was 
supplied 
by Engel- 
hard 
(UK) 
with 
fairly 
uniform 
particles 
of 
about 
& 
in. in size and surface 
area of 
about 250 m”/g. 
The reaction 
was 
studied 
in a conven- 
tional 
fixed bed flow 
reactor 
and operated 
at atmospheric 
pressure. 
The products 
were 
analyzed 
by gas chromatography 
(Tables 
1 and 2). 
After 
the weighed 
quantity 
of catalyst 
has been introduced 
into the reactor, 
the 
latter 
was 
flushed 
with 
Nz at a flow 
rate 
of 100 ml/min 
to eliminate 
oxygen. 
During 
this flushing, 
the reactor 
temperature 
was 
raised to 450°C over a period of 3 hr, hydro- 
gen was then passed at a rate of 150 ml/min 
for 4 hr at the same temperature. 
When 
sulfided 
catalyst 
was 
used, 
the 
sulfiding 
process was carried out by passing 
a mixture 
of Hz + H&V!! (1: 1 by volume, 
total volume 150 ml/min) 
for 4 hr at 350°C. 
In order to maintain 
the catalyst 
in the 
sulfided 
state 
during 
the experiment, 
hy- 
drogen 
sulfide 
was 
added to the propane 
feed at the rate of 20 ml/min 
during 
the 
heat-up 
period and during 
the first hour of 
the process. 
Since the catalyst 
loses activity 
during 
operation 
due to deposition 
of carbon on the 
surface 
it was necessary 
to regenerate 
the 
catalyst. 
This 
was 
done by 
heating 
the 
catalyst 
in a stream 
of 80% 
02 and 20% 
Nz at 450-500°C 
for several hours, 
this was 
followed 
by 
subjecting 
the 
catalyst 
to 
hydrogen 
treatment 
(or 
Hz + H+$) 
for 
4-6 
hr at 550°C 
before 
it was 
ready 
for 
further 
dehydrogenation 
runs. The catalyst 
aetivity 
was 
completely 
restored 
after this 
regeneration 
process. 
The 
dehydrogenation 
of 
propane 
to 
propylene 
was 
first 
investigated 
on the 
reduced 
and 
sulfided 
0.5% 
Pd/AL 
03 
catalysts. 
Results 
given in Table 
1 show 
the per- 
formance 
of both 
catalysts 
at 
different 
temperatures 
using propane 
feed at 1 atm 
pressure 
and space velocity 
of 600 hr-‘. 
The reduced 
Pd/ALOs 
is clearly superior 
to the sulfided catalyst. 
It shows 
a moderate 
activity 
as can be seen from 
conversion 
data, and high selectivity 
to propylene 
at 
temperatures 
as high as 611°C. On the other 
hand, 
sulfided 
Pd/A1203 
catalyst 
shows 
poor 
activity 
although 
its selectivity 
was 
fairly 
high 
(71%). 
Sulfiding 
Pd/AlzOs 
did 
not, 
therefore, 
improve 
activity 
and/or 
selectivity 
over the reduced 
catalyst. 
Table 2 summarizes 
the results 
of added 
SOZ on conversion 
and selectivity 
at differ- 
ent 
temperatures 
and 
C3H8/S02 
ratios. 
The addition 
of SO2 to the feed increases

the conversion 
of propane ; however, 
the 
selectivities 
to 
propylene 
are far 
below 
those 
obtained 
with 
pure 
propane 
feed 
(see Table 1). 
The conclusions 
which 
could be drawn 
from this study 
are: First, 
sulfiding 
palla- 
dium catalyst 
did not improve 
activity 
or 
selectivity. 
Second, the reduced 
Pd/A1203 
catalyst 
offers 
some advantages 
over 
the 
conventional 
Crz03-A120rK30 
dehydro- 
genation 
catalyst 
(S), 
especially 
in high 
temperature 
operations 
in which 
appreci- 
able 
increase 
in selectivity 
per 
pass 
is 
noticed 
(see bottom 
of Table 1).

o Reduced

sulfided 
catalysts; 
space velocity, 
600 hr-1; 
no SO, 
added. 
In a few 
experiments 
coke deposited 
on 
chroma-alumina 
was 
measured 
and 
it 
averaged 
2-4% 
of the propane 
converted 
compared 
with 
less than 1% for Pd/A1203 
catalyst. 
The third 
conclusion 
is that 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
using 
SO, offers 
another 
alternative 
to overcome 
the 
equilibrium 
limitation 
of the reaction; 
Pd/A1,03 
offers 
some hope in this respect. 
Although 
it is premature 
at this stage to 
give some insight 
into the mechanisms 
of 
these 
reactions, 
however, 
SOZ seems 
to 
abstract 
hydrogen 
from 
the alkane 
with 
the result 
that hydrogen 
sulfide and water 
are formed. 
These 
were 
detected 
by glc 
analysis. 
On the other 
hand, 
the relatively 
low 
selectivity 
of Pd/Al,Os 
to propylene 
could 
result from the latter 
being oxidized by SO2 
to water 
and carbon 
dioxide. 
The presence 
of COZ among the reaction 
products 
seems 
to support 
this view.
