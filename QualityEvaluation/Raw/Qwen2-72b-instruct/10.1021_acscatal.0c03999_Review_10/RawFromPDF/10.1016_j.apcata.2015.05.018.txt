 Introduction
Propylene
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 large-tonnage
 products
of
 reﬁning
 of
 natural
 gas
 and
 petroleum
 products.
 It
 is
 being
 isolated
from
 the
 products
 of
 the
 cracking,
 pyrolysis,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 thermal
and
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 [1].
 The
 catalytic
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 the
 most
 direct
 and
 selective
 route
 for
 the
production
 of
 propylene.
 The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 per-
formed
 over
 variety
 of
 catalysts,
 notably,
 over
 Cr2O3,
 MoO3,
 V2O5,
TiO2,
 and
 GeO2 [2–4].
 The
 main
 problem
 limiting
 the
 industrial
application
 of
 this
 method
 is
 the
 necessity
 to
 use
 high
 temperatures
in
 order
 to
 increase
 the
 oleﬁn
 equilibrium
 concentration
 since
 the
dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 an
 endothermic
 reaction:
C3H8 →
 C3H6 +
 H2,
 
rН◦
298 =
 124.27
 kJ/mol.
 
(1)
In
 this
 case,
 the
 dehydrogenation
 is
 usually
 accompanied
 by
intense
 deposition
 of
 coke
 due
 to
 the
 high
 temperatures
 of
 the
process.
 Furthermore,
 one
 of
 the
 undesirable
 byproducts
 is
 methyl
acetylene
 which
 poisons
 the
 polymerization
 catalysts
 in
 the
 further
polypropylene
 production
 [5].
To
 overcome
 these
 problems,
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
propane
 over
 various
 catalysts
 is
 being
 developed
 [6–8].

propylene
 in
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 even
 over
 the
 best
 cat-
alysts
 known
 to
 date
 does
 not
 exceed
 35%
 which
 is
 not
 sufﬁcient
 to
satisfy
 the
 economic
 feasibility.
 The
 yield
 of
 40%
 was
 achieved
 over
Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O
 mixed
 oxides
 [9].
 The
 highest
 selectivity
 (94–96%)
was
 achieved
 at
 200 ◦C
 over
 PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst
 at
 the
 conver-
sion
 of
 approximately
 20%
 [10].
The
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 by
 molecular
 oxygen
 is
 the
exothermic
 process:
C3H8 +
 1/2O2 →
 C3H6 +
 H2O,
 
rН◦
298 =
 −117.57
 kJ/mol.
 
(2)
This
 process
 is
 accompanied
 by
 the
 deep
 oxidation
 of
 propane
to
 carbon
 dioxide
 and
 water:
C3H8 +
 5O2 →
 3CO2 +
 4H2O,
 
rН◦
298 =
 −2044.04
 kJ/mol.
(3)
The
 latter
 complicates
 the
 industrial
 realization
 of
 this
 process
due
 to
 the
 necessity
 of
 waste-heat
 utilization.
There
 
are
 
attempts
 
to
 
use
 
various
 
organochlorine
 
com-
pounds
 [11,12],
 sulfur-containing
 compounds
 [13,14],
 nitrous
oxide
 [15,16],
 CO2 [17],
 and
 halogens
 [18]
 as
 mild
 oxidants
 for
 the
dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 the
 application
of
 halogens
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 was
 proposed
 more
 than
 40
years
 ago,
 based
 on
 thermodynamic
 calculations
 [18]. Pasternak
and
 Vadekar
 calculated
 the
 thermodynamics
 of
 the
 oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 hydrocarbons
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 different
 halogens.
Molecular
 chlorine
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 the
 most
 advantageous
 oxi-
dizing
 agent
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 thermodynamic
 calculations.

Formed
 HCl
 was
 proposed
 to
 be
 oxidized
 by
 oxygen
 back
 to
 Cl2 (the
Deacon
 reaction)
 [18].
It
 is
 assumed
 that
 the
 chlorination
 of
 propane
 leads
 to
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 monoclorides
 of
 propane:
C3H8 +
 Cl2 →
 C3H7Cl
 +
 НCl,
 
rН◦
298 =
 −133.36
 kJ/mol.
 
(4)
These
 monochlorides
 are
 easily
 dechlorinated
 to
 form
 propyl-
ene:
C3H7Cl
 →
 C3H6 +
 HCl,
 
rН◦
298 =
 73.01
 kJ/mol.
 
(5)
The
 total
 enthalpy
 of
 the
 reaction:
C3H8 +
 Cl2 →
 2HCl
 +
 C3H6,
 
rН◦
298 =
 −60.34
 kJ/mol.
 
(6)
is
 −60.34
 kJ/mol
 only,
 which
 simpliﬁes
 the
 task
 of
 waste-heat
 uti-
lization.
 For
 many
 years,
 this
 way
 of
 the
 oleﬁns
 production
 was
thermodynamically
 complicated
 by
 the
 necessity
 to
 perform
 the
Deacon
 reaction,
 for
 which
 no
 effective
 catalysts
 were
 available.
Nowadays,
 a
 RuO2/TiO2 catalyst
 is
 proposed
 for
 the
 Deacon
 reac-
tion
 that
 allows
 performing
 this
 process
 at
 temperatures
 below
300 ◦C
 [19–21].
 Catalysts
 based
 on
 ruthenium
 also
 show
 good
 per-
formance
 in
 other
 reactions
 involving
 chlorine
 or
 its
 derivatives,
such
 as
 the
 oxychlorination
 of
 methane
 and
 ethane
 [22].
 Probably,
the
 reactivity
 of
 ruthenium
 compounds
 in
 the
 reactions
 involving
chlorine
 and
 organochlorines
 is
 due
 to
 the
 high
 ruthenium
 afﬁnity
to
 chlorine.
 Hevia
 et
 al.
 [23]
 suggested
 that
 the
 active
 site
 of
 the
RuO2/TiO2 catalyst
 in
 the
 Deacon
 reaction
 was
 RuO2−xClx ruthe-
nium
 oxychloride.
 Crihan
 et
 al.
 [20]
 indicated
 that
 RuO2 surface
 was
chlorinated
 during
 the
 catalyzed
 oxidation
 of
 HCl
 with
 oxygen
 by
selective
 replacement
 of
 bridging
 oxygen
 atoms
 by
 bridging
 chlo-
rine
 atoms.
 This
 view
 was
 conﬁrmed
 by
 Teschner
 et
 al.
 [24]
 showed
that
 the
 surface
 of
 RuO2 was
 extensively
 chlorinated
 at
 typical
 Dea-
con
 reaction
 conditions.
 It
 was
 shown
 that
 the
 K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2
catalyst
 was
 more
 active
 in
 the
 Deacon
 reaction
 in
 comparison
 with
RuO2 and
 exceeds
 all
 known
 catalysts
 for
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 in
the
 oxychlorination
 of
 ethane
 and
 methane
 [22].
The
 aim
 of
 this
 work
 was
 the
 study
 of
 catalysts
 based
 on
 ruthe-
nium
 oxychloride
 in
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 by
molecular
 chlorine.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
 and
 characterization
Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 (0.28
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
 prepared
 by
 the
 incipi-
ent
 wetness
 impregnation
 of
 titania
 (Degussa
 P-25
 with
 a
 speciﬁc
surface
 area
 of
 57
 m2/g
 and
 a
 pore
 volume
 of
 0.36
 cm3/g)
 with
 an
aqueous
 hydrochloric
 acid
 solution
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 (Aurat,
 Russia)
with
 pH
 =
 1
 at
 90 ◦C
 followed
 by
 drying
 at
 110 ◦C
 and
 calcination
in
 air
 at
 350 ◦C
 for
 2
 h.
 Low
 solubility
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 in
 water
complicates
 the
 preparation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 with
 high
 ruthenium
content
 (the
 maximum
 ruthenium
 content
 we
 were
 able
 to
 achieve
by
 incipient
 wetness
 impregnation
 was
 0.4
 wt.%).
 Therefore,
 we
applied
 another
 synthesis
 approaches
 to
 obtain
 Ru/TiO2 catalysts
with
 higher
 ruthenium
 content.
 Ru/TiO2-2
 catalyst
 (2
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
prepared
 by
 the
 oxidation
 of
 Ru(III)
 (RuCl3)
 to
 Ru(IV)
 by
 potas-
sium
 perchlorate
 (KClO4).
 For
 this
 purpose,
 the
 titanium
 oxide
 was
impregnated
 by
 the
 incipient
 wetness
 method
 with
 a
 solution
 of
RuCl3 (Aurat,
 Russia)
 and
 dried
 in
 air
 at
 60 ◦C
 for
 2
 h.
 Then,
 the
resulting
 RuCl3/TiO2 was
 impregnated
 by
 a
 solution
 of
 KClO4 +
 KCl
(Vekton,
 Russia).
 The
 concentration
 of
 KClO4 was
 25
 g/L
 and
 the
concentration
 of
 KCl
 was
 16
 g/L.
 The
 resulting
 sample
 was
 washed
with
 deionized
 water
 and
 dried
 at
 60 ◦C
 for
 2
 h.
 Ru/TiO2-3
 catalyst
(5
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
 prepared
 by
 the
 mechanical
 mixing
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
and
 TiO2.
 Necessary
 amounts
 of
 regents
 were
 mixed
 until
 a
 homo-
geneous
 mass
 was
 obtained
 and
 then
 it
 was
 triturated
 in
 a
 mortar
for
 1
 h.
 The
 amount
 of
 ruthenium
 in
 the
 samples
 was
 determined
by
 atomic
 emission
 spectroscopy
 with
 inductively
 coupled
 plasma
using
 an
 Optima
 4300
 DV
 PerkinElmer
 spectrometer.
UV–vis
 diffuse
 reﬂectance
 (UV–vis
 DR)
 spectra
 were
 recorded
by
 a
 Shimadzu
 UV-2501
 PC
 spectrophotometer
 equipped
 with
an
 ISR-240A
 diffuse
 reﬂectance
 attachment.
 The
 spectra
 were
registered
 with
 respect
 to
 a
 BaSO4 powder
 in
 the
 range
 of
11,000
 −
 53,000
 cm−1.
 The
 obtained
 reﬂectance
 spectra
 were
converted
 into
 the
 F(R)
 Kubelka–Munk
 function.
 A
 crystalline
K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 sample
 was
 also
 studied
 by
 UV–vis
 DR
 spec-
troscopy
 for
 comparison.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS)
 studies
 were
 per-
formed
 on
 a
 photoelectron
 spectrometer
 (SPECS
 Surface
 Nano
Analysis
 GmbH)
 equipped
 with
 a
 hemispherical
 PHOIBOS-150
 ana-
lyzer
 and
 an
 XR-50
 X-ray
 source
 with
 a
 double
 Mg/Al
 anode.
 The
XPS
 spectra
 were
 acquired
 in
 the
 ﬁxed
 pass
 energy
 mode
 using
 Mg
K
 radiation
 (h
 =
 1253.6
 eV).
 Relative
 concentrations
 of
 elements
were
 determined
 from
 the
 total
 intensities
 of
 corresponding
 core-
level
 spectra
 using
 cross-sections
 according
 to
 Scoﬁeld
 [25].
 All
 the
spectra
 were
 analyzed
 using
 the
 FitXPS
 software.
 In
 short,
 after
subtraction
 of
 a
 Shirley-type
 background
 [26],
 the
 spectra
 were
 ﬁt
using
 Gaussian/Lorentzian
 line-shapes.
 The
 charge
 effect
 was
 cor-
rected
 by
 setting
 the
 C1s
 peak
 (due
 to
 adventitious
 hydrocarbons)
at
 284.8
 eV.
 For
 the
 XPS
 study,
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 was
 chosen
due
 to
 the
 highest
 catalytic
 activity.
2.2.
 Catalyst
 testing
The
 catalytic
 experiments
 were
 performed
 in
 a
 tubular
 ﬂow
reactor
 with
 a
 ﬁxed
 catalyst
 bed
 (quartz
 tube
 of
 200
 mm
 long
 and
with
 an
 inner
 diameter
 of
 7
 mm)
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 in
 the
temperature
 range
 of
 150–450 ◦C.
 The
 amount
 of
 catalyst
 placed
into
 the
 reactor
 was
 1.0
 g.
 Propane
 and
 argon
 (Sibtekhgaz,
 Russia)
with
 a
 purity
 of
 at
 least
 99.9%
 were
 introduced
 into
 the
 reactor
using
 mass-ﬂow
 controllers.
 Chlorine
 produced
 in
 an
 electrolytic
cell
 was
 supplied
 with
 a
 mixture
 of
 argon.
 All
 technological
 tubes
and
 tanks
 of
 chlorine
 were
 isolated
 from
 the
 light.
 The
 quantity
of
 generated
 chlorine
 was
 calculated
 according
 to
 the
 electro-
chemical
 equivalent
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 electricity
 passed
 through
the
 saturated
 sodium
 chloride
 solution
 used
 as
 an
 electrolyte.
The
 gas
 hourly
 space
 velocity
 (GHSV)
 of
 propane
 and
 chlorine
were
 200
 and
 50
 (100)
 h−1,
 respectively.
 The
 argon
 was
 supplied
with
 the
 GHSV
 of
 400
 h−1.
 The
 molar
 ratio
 of
 the
 reactants
 was
C3H8:Cl2:Ar
 =
 2:(0.5–1):4.
 The
 total
 GHSV
 of
 the
 reactant
 feed
 was
650−700
 h−1.
 Sampling
 gaseous
 products
 was
 performed
 directly
at
 the
 reactor
 outlet.
 The
 reaction
 products
 were
 analyzed
 by
 a
Tsvet-570
 chromatograph
 equipped
 with
 a
 specially
 made
 capil-
lary
 column
 (20
 m
 ×
 0.32
 mm)
 with
 a
 DVB-PLOT
 stationary
 phase
and
 a
 ﬂame
 ionization
 detector.
At
 the
 gas-phase
 chlorination
 of
 propane
 (4),
 only
 half
 of
 the
chlorine
 atoms
 leads
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 chlorocarbons
 and
 the
other
 half
 provides
 hydrogen
 chloride.
 When
 performing
 the
 reac-
tion
 in
 excess
 of
 the
 hydrocarbon
 with
 a
 molar
 ratio
 of
 C3H8/Cl2 =
 4
(or
 C3H8/Cl2 =
 2
 in
 some
 experiments)
 at
 the
 complete
 consumption
of
 chlorine
 and
 the
 formation
 of
 only
 monochlorinated
 hydro-
carbon,
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
 will
 not
 exceed
 25%
 (or
 50%,
respectively).
 The
 conversion
 of
 propane
 will
 be
 lower
 in
 case
 of
the
 formation
 of
 deeply
 chlorinated
 compounds.

 The
 spectrum
 of

 oxychloride
 is
 characterized
by
 bands
 at
 14,000,
 17,000,
 and
 20,000
 cm−1 (curve

 The
 spec-
trum
 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 (curve
 2a)
 contains
 the
 bands
of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 as
 well
 as
 an
 additional

 at
 22,600
 cm−1
(curve

 characteristic
 for
 K4[Ru2O2(H2O)4Cl8]
 ruthenium
 com-
plex,
 probably
 formed
 by
 the
 partial
 hydrolysis
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
[27,28].
 The
 spectrum
 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-2
 catalyst
 (curve

also
 contains
 the
 bands
 at
 14,000,
 17,000,
 and
 20,000
 cm−1,
 how-
ever
 the
 ratio
 of
 intensities
 of
 these
 bands
 is
 different
 from
 that
 of
the
 spectrum
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10],
 which
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 forma-
tion
 of
 various
 ruthenium
 oxychlorides.
 The
 manifestation
 of
 the
band
 at
 14,000
 cm−1 proves
 the
 presence
 of
 [Ru2OCl10]4−anions.
It
 is
 well
 known
 [29]
 that
 the
 bridging
 oxygen
 in
 this

 has
 the
electrophylic
 nature
 and
 may
 be
 responsible
 for
 the
 low

 An

 the

 in
 the
 fresh

 catalysts.
Crystalline
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 as
 well
 as
 the
 freshly
 prepared
and
 spent
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 were
 studied
 by
 XPS.
 The
 atomic
ratios
 of
 the
 elements
 in
 the
 subsurface
 layer
 of
 the
 samples
 are
shown
 in
 Table
 1.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 the
 [K]/[Ru]
 atomic
 ratio
observed
 for
 the
 crystalline
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 sample
 slightly
 dif-
fer
 from
 the
 stoichiometric
 composition.
 It
 may
 be
 because
 XPS
is
 a
 surface-sensitive
 method,
 the
 XPS
 analysis
 depth
 is
 several
nanometers
 only.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 [O]/[Ru]
 atomic
 ratio
 on
the
 surface
 is
 the
 same
 as
 that
 in
 the
 bulk.
 The
 content
 of
 chlo-
rine
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 is
 reduced.
 It
 seems
 to
 be
due
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 RuOx species
 on
 the
surface
 of
 crystalline
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O.
 Note,
 that
 in
 both
 cases,
oxygen
 on
 the
 surface
 occupies
 bridging
 positions
 between
 the
 two
neighboring
 ruthenium
 cations.
 In
 contrast,
 the
 content
 of
 chlo-
rine
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 is
 overstated.
It
 indicates
 that
 the
 surface
 of
 titania
 is
 partially
 covered
 by
 chlo-
rine
 species.
 The
 Ru3d5/2,
 O1s,
 and
 Cl2p3/2 binding
 energies
 of
 the
fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 and
 reference
 compounds
 are
 shown
 in
Table
 2.
 According
 to
 the
 literature
 [30,31],
 the
 Ru3d5/2 binding
energy
 of
 RuO2 are
 in
 the
 range
 of
 280.5–281.4
 eV,
 the
 Ru3d5/2 bind-
ing
 energy
 of
 RuO3 and
 RuO4 are
 282.5
 and
 283.3
 eV,
 respectively.
It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 last
 Ru–oxide
 phases
 were
 discussed
 in
the
 literature
 [30,32,33],
 and
 some
 authors
 suggested
 that
 RuO3
may
 be
 present
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 RuO2 as
 an
 intermediate
 and
cannot
 be
 synthesized
 as
 a
 unique
 compound.

 assigned
the
 Ru3d5/2 binding
 energy
 of
 282.7
 eV
 to
 the

 of
 the
RuO2 plasmon
 [32,33].
 The
 Ru3d
 features
 ascribed
 to
 RuO3 and
RuO4 in
 Refs.
 [30,31]
 can
 equally
 be
 explained
 by
 contaminations.
The
 Ru3d5/2 binding
 energy
 of
 complexes
 containing
 chlorine
 is
higher
 in
 comparison
 with
 oxygen-containing
 compounds,
 even
at
 a
 lower
 ruthenium
 charge:
 the
 Ru3d5/2 binding
 energies
 of
RuCl3 and
 RuCl3·H2O
 are
 281.8
 and
 282.1
 eV,
 respectively
 [34,35].
The
 Ru3d5/2 binding
 energy
 of
 bulk
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 is
 282.8
 eV;
hence,
 we
 can
 speculate
 that
 ruthenium
 is
 in
 the
 Ru4+ state.

 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O,

 and

 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst.
K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 is
 due
 to
 the
 presence
 of
 two
 components
 of
approximately
 equal
 intensity
 with
 the
 maxima
 at
 531.7
 and
533.1
 eV.
 The
 ﬁrst
 peak
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 oxygen
 anions
 that
are
 directly
 bonded
 to
 the
 Ru
 atoms.
 The
 second
 peak
 at
 the
 higher
binding
 energy
 corresponds
 to
 oxygen
 in
 the
 molecules
 of
 water
[36,37].
 The
 O1s
 binding
 energy
 of
 RuO2 is
 528.4–529.6
 eV
 which
 is
close
 to
 the
 O1s
 binding
 energy
 of
 various
 transition
 metal
 oxides
[37].
 These
 binding
 energies
 are
 signiﬁcantly
 lower
 than
 that
 for
ruthenium
 oxychloride
 (the
 ﬁrst
 peak
 in
 the
 O1s
 spectrum).
 There-
fore,
 it
 can
 be
 concluded
 that
 ruthenium
 oxychloride
 has
 a
 lower
partial
 charge
 of
 oxygen
 (Oı−)
 when
 compared
 with
 oxygen
 in
ruthenium
 oxides.
 The
 O1s
 spectra
 of
 the
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts
consist
 of
 an
 intensive
 peak
 at
 529.9
 eV
 and
 a
 weak
 peak
 at
 531.8
 eV.
The
 ﬁrst
 peak
 certainly
 corresponds
 to
 oxygen
 in
 the
 TiO2 lattice
(Table
 2)
 whereas
 the
 second
 peak
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
 Ru
 O
 Ru
species.
 The
 last
 is
 in
 good
 agreement
 with
 small
 values
 of
 the
[Ru]/[Ti]
 atomic
 ratio
 observed
 (Table
 1).
 The
 Cl2p
 spectrum
 of
bulk
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 contains
 an
 intense
 Cl2p3/2 −
 Cl2p1/2 dou-
blet
 with
 peaks
 at
 198.0

 199.6

 respectively,
 as
 well
 as
 a
signiﬁcantly
 less
 intense
 doublet
 with
 the

 energy
equal

 (Fig.

in
 the
 range
 of

 eV
 [38–41].
 For
 KClO3 and
 KClO4 with
positively
 charged
 chlorine,
 the
 Cl2p
 binding
 energy
 is
 signiﬁcantly
higher
 and
 usually
 observed
 in
 the
 range
 of
 206.3–208.3
 eV
 [41].
 In
the
 Cl2p
 spectra
 of
 the
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalysts,
 only
 one
 doublet
with
 the
 Cl2p3/2 binding
 energy
 of
 198.1
 eV
 is
 observed.
The
 XPS
 data
 for
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 differ
 from
 that
 of
bulk
 ruthenium
 oxychloride
 (Table
 2).
 The
 Ru3d5/2 binding
 energy
of
 the
 catalyst
 is
 281.0
 eV
 instead
 of
 282.8
 eV
 for
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O.
The
 electronic
 state
 of
 oxygen
 bonded
 with
 ruthenium
 is
 the
 same:
the
 O1s
 binding
 energy
 is
 531.7–531.8
 eV
 in
 both
 cases.
 However,
the
 [ORu]/[Ru]
 atomic
 ratio
 is
 higher
 for
 the
 catalyst
 and
 is
 equal
 to
1
 instead
 of
 0.5
 for
 bulk
 ruthenium
 oxychloride.
 The
 Cl2p3/2 bind-
ing
 energy
 for
 the
 fresh
 and
 spent
 catalyst
 is
 the
 same
 as
 for
 bulk
ruthenium
 oxychloride
 (198.1
 eV).
 Besides,
 the
 chlorine
 content
 is
higher
 for
 the
 supported
 catalyst.
 This
 can
 be
 explained
 by
 the
 fact
that
 the
 impregnation
 of
 titanium
 oxide
 by
 the
 hydrochloric
 acid
solution
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 leads
 to
 the
 partial
 chlorination
 of
 the
titanium
 oxide
 surface,
 and
 it
 is
 difﬁcult
 to
 distinguish
 between
 the
chlorine
 atoms
 associated
 with
 the
 support
 in
 the
 form
 of
 Ru
 Cl
 Ti
bridges
 from
 the
 chlorine
 atoms
 bonded
 only
 with
 the
 ruthenium
atoms
 (Ru
 Cl
 Ru).
Hence,
 the
 XPS
 study
 of
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 showed
 that
the
 ruthenium
 is
 in
 the
 Ru4+ state
 mainly,
 the
 oxygen
 and
 chlo-
rine
 atoms
 possess
 the
 same
 properties
 as
 those
 in
 the
 bulk
K4[Ru2OCl10].
 Therefore,
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 UV–vis
 DRS
 and
 XPS
data,
 we
 can
 assume
 that
 the
 active
 component
 of
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
catalyst
 is
 ruthenium
 oxychloride
 with
 the
 bridging
 oxygen
 of
 the
electrophylic
 nature
 in
 [Ru2OCl10]4−anion
 [29].
3.2.
 Catalyst
 performance
The
 catalysts
 prepared
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 ruthenium
 oxychloride
were
 tested
 in
 the
 reaction
 of
 propane
 with
 molecular
 chlo-
rine
 in
 the
 temperature
 range
 of
 200–450 ◦C.
 Fig.
 4
 shows
 the
temperature
 dependence
 of
 the
 propane
 conversion
 and
 the
 selec-
tivity
 toward
 propylene
 oxide,
 2-chloropropane,
 1-chloropropane,
and
 1,2-dichloropropane
 for
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 at
 the
 molar
ratio
 of
 C3H8/Cl2 =
 4.
 This
 catalyst
 showed
 the
 highest
 selectiv-
ity
 toward
 propylene
 (96.7%
 at
 400 ◦C
 and
 at
 the
 molar
 ratio
 of
C3H8:Cl2:Ar
 =
 2:0.5:4).
It
 has
 been
 found
 that
 1,2-dichloropropane
 is
 the
 main
 reac-
tion
 product
 for
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 at
 low
 temperatures
(up
 to
 300 ◦C).
 At
 high
 temperatures
 near
 400–450 ◦C,
 propyl-
ene
 is
 formed
 with
 a
 high
 selectivity.
 The
 dehydrochlorination
 of
1,2-dichloropropane
 may
 result
 in
 the
 formation
 of
 monochloro-
propylene
 or
 methylacetylene,
 however
 the
 content
 of
 these
products
 at
 high
 temperatures
 is
 negligible.
 It
 indicates
 that
 besides
the
 reaction
 path
 through
 the
 chlorination
 and
 the
 subsequent
dehydrochlorination
 over
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst,
 propylene
 can
be
 formed
 by
 the
 direct
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 with
 molec-
ular
 chlorine,
 like
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
oxygen
 [42].
 The
 conversion
 of
 propane
 increases
 with
 increase
 in
temperature,
 and
 propylene
 is
 formed
 with
 a
 high
 selectivity
 due
to
 the
 lack
 of
 chlorine
 in
 the
 reaction
 mixture.
The
 twofold
 increase
 of
 the
 chlorine
 content
 (C3H8/Cl2 =
 2)
 in
 the
initial
 reactant
 feed
 leads
 to
 increase
 in
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane.
Table
 3
 shows
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
 and
 selectivity
 toward
propylene
 and
 chlorinated
 products
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Ru-
containing
 catalysts
 at
 temperatures
 above
 300 ◦C
 and
 at
 the
 molar
ratio
 of
 the
 reactants
 in
 the
 initial
 feed
 of
 C3H8:Cl2:Ar
 =
 2:1:4.
When
 comparing
 the
 results
 obtained
 for
 the
 different
 Ru-
containing
 catalysts,
 it
 was
 found
 that
 the
 selectivity
 toward
propylene
 at
 400 ◦C
 over
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 (94.6%)
 prepared
by
 impregnation
 was
 higher
 than
 that
 over
 the
 Ru/TiO2-3
 catalyst
represented
 the
 mechanical
 mixture
 (78.7%)
 at
 similar
 conversions
of
 propane.
 For
 the
 Ru/TiO2-2
 catalyst,
 only
 minor
 quantities
 of
 1-
chloropropane
 were
 observed
 at
 300 ◦C
 at
 the
 reactor
 outlet.
 The
conversion
 increased
 signiﬁcantly
 at
 350 ◦C
 and
 reached
 50%.
 The
selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 was
 88.3%.
 A
 rapid
 fall
 in
 the
 con-
version
 of
 propane
 (3.5%)
 was
 observed
 after
 raising
 the
 reactor
temperature
 up
 to
 400 ◦C.
 The
 subsequent
 lowering
 of
 the
 tem-
perature
 down
 to
 350 ◦C
 led
 to
 a
 complete
 deactivation
 of
 the
sample
 indicating
 a
 change
 in
 the
 catalyst
 state,
 probably
 due
to
 the
 destruction
 of
 ruthenium
 oxychloride.
 This
 is
 consistent
with
 the
 UV–vis
 DR
 spectroscopy
 data
 (Fig.
 1)
 showed
 that
 the
bands
 at
 14,000,
 17,000,
 and
 20,000
 cm−1 characteristic
 for
 bulk
K4[Ru2OCl10]
 are
 absent
 in
 the
 spectrum
 of
 the
 spent
 catalyst.

 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Ru-based
 catalyst
permits
 to
 produce
 propylene
 with
 the
 selectivity
 of
 95%.
 Further-
more,
 this
 process
 can
 be
 performed,
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 thermal
and
 oxidation
 processes,
 at
 a
 lower
 temperature
 (400 ◦C
 vs.
 600 ◦C),
which
 reduces
 signiﬁcantly
 the
 possibility
 of
 cracking
 of
 reaction
products.
 The
 conversion
 of
 propane
 is
 determined
 by
 a
 total
 con-
sumption
 of
 chlorine
 and
 depends
 on
 the
 molar
 ratio
 of
 C3H8/Cl2
in
 the
 initial
 reactant
 feed.
 The
 decrease
 in
 amount
 of
 chlorine
in
 the
 initial
 feed
 leads
 to
 the
 increase
 in
 the
 selectivity
 toward
propylene
 and
 to
 decrease
 in
 the
 content
 of
 related
 chlorinated
products.
Propane
 consumption
 turnover
 frequency
 (TOF)
 calculated
 for
propane
 conversion
 of
 50%
 at
 400 ◦C
 and
 a
 ﬂow
 of
 0.2
 L/h
 is
 equal
to
 45
 ×
 10−3 s−1.
 This
 TOF
 value
 is
 comparable
 with
 that
 reported
for
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 over
 vanadia
 catalysts
[8,43];
 however,
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
 in
 our
 case
 is
 higher.

 Conclusions
A
 series
 of
 ruthenium–titania
 catalysts
 was
 prepared
 via
different
 synthesis
 methods
 and
 studied
 in
 the
 oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 by
 molecular
 chlorine.
 The
 formation
 of
ruthenium
 oxychloride
 was
 conﬁrmed
 by
 XPS
 and
 UV–vis
 DR
spectroscopy.
 The
 catalyst
 prepared
 by
 the
 incipient
 wetness
impregnation
 of
 titania
 with
 an
 aqueous
 hydrochloric
 acid
 solution
of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 showed
 the
 best
 catalytic
 performance.
 The
 selec-
tivity
 toward
 propylene
 at
 the
 propane
 conversion
 of
 50%
 reached
95%
 at
 400 ◦C
 and
 TOF
 equal
 to
 45
 ×
 10−3 s−1 which
 is
 comparable
with
 the
 highest
 known
 values
 obtained
 at
 the
 oxidative
 dehydro-
genation
 of
 propane.
