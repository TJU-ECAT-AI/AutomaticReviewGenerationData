1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important chemicals used in
chemical industry. From the point of view of the number of its
applications it could be compared to ethene.
Nowadays, a majority of propene is obtained as one of the
products of steam cracking and ﬂuid catalytic cracking. Additional
sources of propene are dehydrogenation of propane, oleﬁn
metathesis and natural gas-based processes. The signiﬁcance of
the latter processes has gradually increased due to an imbalance
between propene and ethylene production growth rate (both
produced as co-products) resulting in a gap in a propene supply.
The strong demand on propene stimulates the studies focused on
development of new methods of propene production from
alternative substrates and an improvement of the propene yield
from the existing processes.
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has
been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium-
controlled dehydrogenation. It has been shown that in this new
process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the
commercial one. It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the
yield of propene by two independent pathways. CO2 can parti-
cipate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle:
C3H8 þ MeOx Ð C3H6 þ MeOx1 þ H2O
(1)
CO2 þ MeOx1 Ð CO þ MeOx
(2)
Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [1–9],
manganese [10,11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based
catalysts. On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of
hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the
reverse water–gas shift reaction (4).
C3H8 Ð C3H6 þ H2
(3)
CO2 þ H2 Ð CO þ H2O
(4)
The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehy-
drogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. Such
promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of
propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts [14–17].
It should be kept in mind that the dehydrogenation of propane
with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the
methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is
reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical
industry.

Incipient wetness technique was used for a preparation of MCM-supported chromium oxide materials
with a Cr loading ranging from 0.7 to 13.7 wt%. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, UV–vis-
DRS, H2-TPR and BET, and tested as catalysts in dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalytic
reaction was studied in a ﬂow apparatus at 773–923 K. All the tested catalysts exhibited a good catalytic
performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The best results were achieved over the
sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the
conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K). The promoting effect of CO2 on the
yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. This effect was discussed on the basis of
temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of
the reduced catalyst with pure CO2. It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene
observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the
dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water–gas shift reaction.

Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro-
mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most
promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, in
some papers it has been shown that character of the support
strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium
oxide-based catalysts. Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is
commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light
alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2 [1,2,6]. The
unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of
CrOx/ZrO2 system [5], while over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized
diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst
performances.
It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important
factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane
dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2. De Rossi
et al. [18,19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with
two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are
very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species
predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active
polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present.
Moreover, in the latter cases not all Cr atoms are accessible to
reactants, what has also negative effect on the catalytic activity.
It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the
activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogena-
tion of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of
chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. For
this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface
area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species.
Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [6–8], SBA-15
[5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high
surface areas (600–1100 m2 g1), uniform pore size and relatively
high thermal stability.
In the present paper, we have reported the catalytic activity of
MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by the
conventional impregnation method in the dehydrogenation of
propane in the presence and absence of CO2. The role of CO2 is
discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of
CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of MCM-41-based catalysts
MCM-41 support was prepared under basic conditions at room
temperature
using
n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium
chloride
(HTMACl) as a surfactant and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS,
Aldrich) as a silica source. A typical synthesis procedure was as
follows: Solution A was prepared by mixing of 45.3 cm3 of HTMACl
(25 wt% aqueous solution, Aldrich), with 523 cm3 of distilled
water, and then 44.0 cm3 of an aqueous solution of ammonia
(25 wt%, Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH) was added. The solution
was stirred for 10 min and then 48.6 cm3 of TEOS (solution B) was
added under vigorous stirring. The molar composition of the
obtained gel was TEOS:HTMACl:NH3:H2O = 1:0.16:2.7:150. The
stirring was continued for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting
solid was ﬁltered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air at
353 K for 6 h. The template was removed from the synthesized
samples by heating them up to 873 K at a rate of 2 K min1 and
subsequent calcination at 873 K for 12 h in air.
All the catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness
method. Typically, 1 g of dry MCM-41 was treated with 4.2 cm3 of
an aqueous solution containing the desired amount of chromium
(III) nitrate (Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH). The impregnated
samples were dried at room temperature overnight, then heated at
353 K for 6 h and ﬁnally calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air. These
catalysts are designated as CrX/MCM-41, where x expresses the
total chromium content in wt% of Cr.
Pure a-Cr2O3 (Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH) was calcined at
873 K for 3 h in air (before H2-TPR measurements).
2.2. Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded in two ranges of 1–108 and 10–708
(2u) at room temperature, using a Siemens D5005 instrument
operated at 40 kV and 60 mA, equipped with a Cu Ka X-ray source.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at
77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 instrument. The samples
were degassed at 625 K before measurements. Speciﬁc surface
areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method within the relative pressure range P/P0 = 0.05–0.25. Pore
size
distributions
were
calculated
from
the
branch
of
the
adsorption curve using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen
adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.95 or vicinity.
Diffusion reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were taken on a Thermo
Evolution 600 instrument at room temperature. The spectra were
recorded within the wavelength range of 220–850 nm using BaSO4
as a standard.
H2-TPR analysis were performed using Ar/H2 gas mixture (90/
10 vol%). The total ﬂow rate of the feed was 30 cm3 min1. Before
experiment the sample (100 mg) was preheated in a stream of dry
argon at 873 K for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The
sample was heated at 5 K min1 to the ﬁnal temperature of 873 K.
The H2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity
detector and NiO was used as a reference for the calibration of H2
consumption.
The
mechanism
of
the
RWGS
process
was
studied
by
temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of CO2 with
H2. The measurements were performed in a ﬂow microreactor
system equipped with a QMS detector (Prevac). Prior to the TPSR
experiment, a sample (100 mg) was outgassed in a ﬂow of pure
helium at 873 K for 30 min. Subsequently, the microreactor was
cooled down to about 343 K. TPSR was performed using CO2/H2/He
gas mixture with the ratio of 1:1:4 and total ﬂow rate of
12 cm3 min1. The experiment was carried out with a linear
heating rate of 10 K min1 up to the ﬁnal temperature of 923 K. The
reactants and all possible products of reaction were continuously
monitored by the QMS detector. The signal of the helium line
served as the internal standard to compensate ﬂuctuations of the
operating pressure.
The TPSR of CO2 (99.95 vol%) with H2 (99.995 vol%) was also
carried out in sequences of experiments with H2-TPR. Both the
TPSR of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments were done for the
same sample of the catalyst using CO2/H2(83/15 vol%, total ﬂow
rate
30 cm3 min1)
and
Ar/H2 (90/10 vol%,
total
ﬂow
rate
30 cm3 min1) mixtures, respectively. Before the tests the catalyst
was preheated in a dry Ar (Linde 99.998 vol%) stream at 873 K for
30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The H2 consumption
was measured by a thermal conductivity detector. Both Ar and CO2
were additionally puriﬁed using a deoxidizer.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of propane was carried out in a ﬂow-type
quartz reactor packed with 0.5 g of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–
0.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of C3H8:CO2(He) at a molar ratio
of 1:5 with a total ﬂow rate of 30 cm3 min1. Prior to the catalytic
run, the catalyst was preheated in a dry He stream at 873 K for
30 min. Subsequently, temperature of the reactor was adjusted to a
required value and the catalytic test was initiated. The products

and unreacted substrates were analyzed using two gas chromato-
graphs. One of them was equipped with a column (3 m  3 mm)
packed with Porapak Q and a ﬂame ionization detector (for
hydrocarbons analyses). The second chromatograph was equipped
with a column (3 m  3 mm) packed with Carboxen 1000 and a
thermal conductivity detector (for H2, CO and CO2 analyses). All of
the catalytic results presented in this paper correspond to the
initial state of process (after 10 min-on-stream). Conversion of
propane (Cp), yield of propene (Yp) and selectivities to hydro-
carbons products (Si) were calculated according to the following
equations:

where ai is the number of carbon atoms in the compound i and ni is
a number of moles of the compound i. The calculations do not
consider the conversion of propane to coke, as its instantaneous
formation is time-dependent and difﬁcult to estimate. The
conversion of propane to coke estimated independently by
temperature-programmed oxidation for the catalyst kept by 3 h
in stream of propane was below 2%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
Fig. 1a and b shows the XRD patterns obtained for pure and Cr-
modiﬁed MCM-41 in two different regions of 2u angles. In the 2u
range of 1–108 three well-resolved diffraction lines are observed
(Fig. 1a). These lines are indexed to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0)
reﬂections,
characteristic
for
hexagonal
mesostructure.
The
intensity of these diffraction lines for the Cr-containing materials
decreases as the Cr content increases. However, even in the case of
the catalyst with the highest Cr loading (Cr13.7/MCM-41) three
diffraction lines are still observed, indicating that the well-
organized mesoporous structure of the support was remained
during impregnation by the incipient wetness method and
subsequent calcination.
In the 2u range of 10–708, the diffraction lines, corresponding to
the crystal phase of a-Cr2O3 are detected (Fig. 1b). These lines are
present in the XRD patterns of the samples with the Cr content
higher
than
3.4 wt%.
The
absence
of
the
diffraction
lines
characteristic for a-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the
samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high
dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection
limit of XRD technique. Moreover, it is known that even if Cr3+ salts
are used for impregnation, the calcination of the sample in air
atmosphere results in a partial oxidation of chromium species
present on the surface of support into higher valence states [20–
23]. Effectiveness of the Cr3+ oxidation strongly depends on the
nature of support and Cr loading. On the surface of the calcined
silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts the Cr6+ species have
been detected for all the Cr-containing samples. However, at low
loadings (below saturation coverage) the Cr6+ species were found
to be dominant, whereas above the saturation coverage a-Cr2O3
was formed. The surface composition inﬂuences the color of the
supported catalyst. Yellow color is characteristic to monochro-
mates, orange to polychromates, while green and blue colors
indicate the presence of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, respectively. The
color of the calcined catalysts studied in the present paper changed
from bright yellow over pale yellow to dark green with the Cr
loading increasing from 0.7 to 13.7 wt%.
An existence of different kinds of chromium oxide species on
the MCM-41 surface was conﬁrmed by UV–vis-DR spectroscopy.

supported chromium oxide catalysts. Two main absorption bands
at 270 and 365 nm and one shoulder band at about 440 nm appear
for all the samples. These peaks were assigned to Cr6+–O2 charge
transfer transition of chromate species [18,24,25]. The spectra of
the catalysts with the Cr content above 3.4 wt% show additionally
two bands at 470 and 600 nm due to the A2g ! T1g and A2g ! T2g
transitions of Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry, respectively. These
absorption bands do not appear in the spectra of the Cr0.7/MCM-
41 and Cr2.1/MCM-41 catalysts, indicating that Cr6+ species are
predominant in the case of the catalysts with a low Cr content.
The temperature-programmed reduction proﬁles of the cal-
cined catalysts and crystalline Cr2O3 (pre-treated in air) are
presented in Fig. 3.
The reduction effects measured for the studied catalysts depend
on the Cr loading. In the case of Cr0.7/MCM-41 catalyst, two
reduction maxima at 594 and 685 K were observed. The presence
of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species
differently interacting with the silica support [3,21]. On the
contrary, the TPR proﬁles of the catalysts with the higher Cr
loadings show only one reduction maximum in the temperature
range of 590–690 K. An increase in the Cr content above 3.4 wt% of
Cr results in an appearance of additional low-temperature
reduction maximum at about 553 K. The location of this maximum
coincided well with the low temperature reduction maximum
observed for calcined a-Cr2O3, which is assigned to reduction of
Cr6+ to Cr3+ [26] or Cr2+ [27] species dispersed on a-Cr2O3.
Therefore, the presence of low temperature maximum conﬁrms an
existence of a-Cr2O3 in the catalysts with Cr loading above 3.4 wt%.
The calibration of the detector signal allowed us to calculate the
consumption of H2 (mmol H2 g1) and the ratio of H2/Crtot
(Table 1). The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up
to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest
Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from
1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr.
This strong decrease of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr
loading is due to the formation of crystalline a-Cr2O3. A similar
drop of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr loading has been
observed in the case of chromium oxide systems deposited on
various supports (Al2O3 [26,28], TiO2 [28], ZrO2 [29] or SiO2
[27,28]). However, the ratios of H2/Crtot obtained for the MCM-41-
supported chromium oxide catalysts are higher compared to those
measured for the SiO2-supported catalysts. It is most likely that
this difference is caused by a high surface area of MCM-41 favoring
a formation of Cr6+ species.

The textural properties of the calcined samples were char-
acterized by low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen. The calcu-
lated speciﬁc surface areas, pore volume and average pore size are
presented in Table 1. Mesoporous MCM-41 and the Cr/MCM-41
catalysts show a uniform pore size distribution with the pore
diameter within the very narrow range between 2.7 and 2.9 nm as
calculated by the BJH method. The speciﬁc surface area and pore
volume decrease gradually with an increase in the Cr loading.
These continuous limitations of the textural parameters with the
increase of the Cr content are caused mainly by the pore blockage.
Moreover, as it has been mentioned above the deposition of Cr on
the surface of MCM-41 leads to a decrease in the intensity of the
diffraction lines observed in 2u range of 1–108. This indicates a
small destruction of the structural regularity of the mesoporous
structure, which in turn inﬂuences the textural properties.
However, even in the case of the material with the highest Cr
loading, the SBET is only about 23% lower than that of MCM-41.
3.2. Dehydrogenation activity
It is well known that the chromium oxide-based catalysts are
active in the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of
hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is not surprising that the CrOx/MCM-41
catalysts exhibit a good catalytic performance in the dehydro-
genation of propane in the presence of CO2 as well.
An effect of the chromium loading on the initial conversion of
propane and selectivity to propene at 823 K is presented in Fig. 4.
The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply
increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches
maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further
increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants
conversion. This can be explained either by pores blocking or by a
formation of less active, crystalline a-Cr2O3. The formation of a-
Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41
was detected by XRD (Fig. 1.) and conﬁrmed by UV–vis-DRS
measurements (Fig. 2.). On the other hand, the dehydrogenating
activity is proportional to the concentration of high-oxidation
state Cr species. The UV–vis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show
that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content
(Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+
species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that
the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as
the catalytic activity increases. Several studies have revealed that
the Cr6+ species generate the dehydrogenation activity [18]. The
Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions
and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the
reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed
to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes
[18,27,30,31].
Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the Cr loading on the yield of
propene in the presence and absence of CO2 was investigated. Fig. 5
shows relationships between the yield of propene obtained in the
presence (YCO2) and absence of CO2 (YHe), and their ratio (YCO2=YHe)
as a function of the Cr loading.
The yield of propene is always higher in the presence of CO2
than in the inert gas atmosphere. A similar promoting effect of CO2
was reported previously for the chromium oxide-based catalysts
obtained by impregnation of commercial silica with Cr(NO3)3
[1,2,9]. Moreover, a clear correlation between the Cr loading and
promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of
propene in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere (YCO2=Yinert), was
found. It was shown that the highest YCO2=YHe ratio was found for
the catalyst with the lowest Cr loading [1,9]. We observed a similar
correlation in this study. However, the effect of the Cr loading on
the YCO2=YHe ratio was less signiﬁcant than that observed over the
SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst. This could be explained
by the difference in the dehydrogenating activity of the silica-
based materials. The conversion of propane over the Cr–O/MCM-
41 catalyst is approximately twice that over the Cr–O/SiO2. Thus,
over the Cr–O/MCM-41 catalyst the dehydrogenation reaction is
closer to equilibrium limitation. In the consequence the promoting
effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is lower in the presence of the
Cr–O/MCM-41 material.
Fig. 6 presents the variation of the catalytic performance
with the reaction temperature. The conversion of propane and
carbon dioxide increases with raising temperature (Fig. 6a). The
yield of propene also rises within the studied temperature range,
however slower than the conversion of propane. This effect should

be attributed to an acceleration of the side reactions at high
temperatures.
Fig. 6b shows the variation of selectivity to all the hydrocarbon
products with the reaction temperature. The main product is
propene, which is obtained with the selectivity of 82–90% within
the temperature range of 773–923 K. In addition to propene, also
light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) are formed.
These by-products appear as a result of cracking and hydrocracking
reactions, which are facilitated at high temperatures. The reaction
temperature inﬂuences also the molar ratios of the main products
(Fig. 6c). It is clear that the ratio of CO/C3H8 rises more steeply with
temperature compared to the ratio of H2/C3H8, suggesting that the
reaction of CO2 with H2 or C3H8 is facilitated at higher temperature.
Moreover, the presence of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the
products mixture may suggest that in the presence of CO2, propene
is produced simultaneously in the dehydrogenation and oxidative
dehydrogenation reactions. The direct participation of CO2 in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over the MCM-41 sup-
ported chromium oxide catalysts has been recently proven [6].
It has been proposed that this alternative propene formation

pathway is the main reason of the higher propene yield observed in
the presence of CO2. However, several studies concerning dehyd-
rogenation of ethylbenzene [32,33] and isobutane [34] suggested
the existence of the synergistic effect between the dehydrogena-
tion and reverse water–gas shift reactions. Our pervious study has
revealed that over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts
the higher yield of propene could be also caused by simultaneous
consumption of hydrogen (formed in the dehydrogenation) in the
RWGS reaction [35]. Taking into account such possibility the
activity of all the samples in the RWGS reaction as well as
regenerative properties of CO2 were tested in the next section.
3.3. Role of CO2
The catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide
catalysts in the RWGS reaction was studied using temperature-
programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of CO2 with H2. The products of
this reaction: H2O and CO were monitored by QMS during heating of
the catalysts in stream of CO2/H2/He mixture (Fig. 7).
Over all the studied materials, the reaction between CO2 and
H2 started at about 550 K. In the spectrum presented the main
line m/z = 18 attributed to H2O one broad peak was observed at
around 720 K. This peak can be assigned to reduction of Cr6+
species by H2. The intensity of the H2O and CO signals increase
dramatically with the increase of temperature, indicating that
the rise of temperature accelerate the reaction between CO2 and
H2. Furthermore, the MS signals related to H2O and CO increase
with the increase of Cr content up to 3.4 wt% of Cr and than only
slightly with further increase of the Cr content. This suggests that
the dispersed chromium species are more active in the RWGS
reaction compared to agglomerated ones. A similar correlation
exists between the dehydrogenation activity and the Cr content.
It should therefore be concluded that the dispersed Cr species are
responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydro-
genation of propane with CO2.
The studies on the mechanism of RWGS and forward WGS
(water–gas shift) reactions over the oxide catalysts suggest that
these reactions may proceed by the surface redox mechanism or
by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving surface
intermediates [36–38]. Recently, Ohishi et al. [33] have proposed
that
over
the
CrOx/MCM-41
catalysts,
the
RWGS
reaction
occurs via the redox mechanism. In this system Cr3+ species
are successively reduced to Cr2+ ones by H2 and then reoxidized
by CO2. The reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ is promoted over silica-
support, which facilitates electron ﬂuctuations, necessary for the
reduction [20]. Moreover, Cr2+ formation is enhanced for the
sample with low Cr content due to high dispersion of the active
phase [20,27].
Fig. 8 shows the results of TPSR of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR
experiments performed for the Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst. The goal of
these studies was investigation of the oxidative properties of CO2.
The series of TPSR/TPR experiments (curves 1 ! 2 ! 3 !
4 ! 5) reveal that the Cr6+ species present in the calcined Cr6.8/
MCM-41 catalyst are reduced in the mixture of H2/CO2. Moreover,
the H2-TPR experiment (curve 3) after second TPSR of CO2 with H2
cycle (curve 2) shows that the catalyst surface is almost completely
reduced.
However,
the
H2-TPR
experiment
performed
after
regeneration of the reduced catalysts in a ﬂow of pure CO2 (curves
4 and 5) reveal a small oxidation effect. This effect increases with
an increase of regeneration time (Fig. 8b), suggesting that CO2
exhibits very weak oxidative properties. Similar poor oxidative
abilities of CO2 were reported previously [1,6]. This suggests that
over the MCM-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the RWGS
reaction may also proceed by redox cycle.
4. Conclusions
The MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by
the impregnation method, exhibit a good catalytic performance in
the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over the most active

Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst the yield of propene and selectivity to
propene are 34.9% and 88.5%, respectively at 823 K.
The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based
materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is
related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+
species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the
catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+).
The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed
over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only
attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy-
drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple
dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction. The high
catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide
catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the
observed higher yield of propene.
