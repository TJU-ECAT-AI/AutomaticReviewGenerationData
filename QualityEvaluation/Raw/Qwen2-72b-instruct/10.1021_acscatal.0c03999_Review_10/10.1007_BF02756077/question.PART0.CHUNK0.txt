Role of Silica-Alumina Catalyst Texture in the Reaction of Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation in the Presence of Sulfur Dioxide
I. G. Danilova and A. S. Ivanova
Boreskov Institute of Catalysis, Siberian Division, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, 630090 Russia Received November 23, 1998 Abstract--The effects of preparation conditions, component ratio, and pretreatment temperature (1000- 1550 of silica-alumina samples on their phase composition, texture characteristics, and catalytic properties are studied in the reaction of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by sulfur dioxide. It is shown that the samples contain individual silicon and aluminum oxides. The product of their interaction (mullite) is formed only at 1550 Mesoporous and macroporous catalysts with mono- and polydispersed pore distributions over sizes are obtained. It is found that the porous structure of the catalyst plays a key role in the process of the oxi- dative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of sulfur dioxide at 600-700 The apparent rate of propy- lene formation increases with an increase in the pore volume with radii between 10 and 100 nm. Propane is transformed into propylene more selectively on the catalyst where the pores with radii of 10-100 nm dominate;narrower pores (< 10 nm) are favorable for the formation of coke and complete oxidation products.
INTRODUCTION
It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxi- dative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon,the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed. These products are themselves more catalytically active toward propylene formation than initial catalysts. The properties OCP depend on the nature of oxide: OCP/A1203 is more active toward propane conversion than OCP/SiO 2, but the latter are more selective toward propylene [1]. Therefore, silica-alumina composites are possibly able to provide a more efficient combina- tion of desired properties.
The goal of this work is the study of the effects of the preparation procedure, component ratio, and the aluminum-silicon catalyst treatment temperature on the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation to pro- pylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide.
EXPERIMENTAL
Silica-alumina catalysts were prepared by wet mix- ing of initial reactants in the desired ratio at a desired wetness with the further formation in tubes with a diame- ter of 2.8-3.0 mm and a length of 4-5 mm, drying at ll0 for 12 h, and calcination at 1000-1550 Four series of samples were prepared, which differed in the nature of aluminum-containing material: (I) pseudo- boehmite aluminum hydroxide, (II) a mixture of pseudoboehmite and hydrargillite aluminum hydrox- ides, (III) thermochemically activated hydrargillite,which is an amorphous mixture of hydrargillite and boehmite, and (IV) alumina prepared by the plasmo- chemical method (a mixture of tx-Al203 (3-5%) plas- mochemical alumina (Al203plasm) with a disordered lat- tice close to 5-A1203). According to the electron micro- scopic data, this oxide consists of the particles with sizes varying over wide ranges from several fractions to several tens of micrometers. The particles differed in the shapes--from globular to spherical. As a silicon- containing material, we used aerosil A-175.
Catalysts were analyzed for the concentrations of silicon and aluminum according to the procedure described in [3]. X-ray phase analyses of the samples were carded out using an HZG-4C diffractometer and CuKa monochromatic irradiation. The specific surface area of the samples were determined by the method argon thermal desorption [4] with an accuracy of +_10%. The porosity was measured before and after the reaction by the method of mercury porosimetry using a Pore Sizer 9300 instrument. To exclude the effect of capillary condensation between 0.5-1.0-mm granules in spent catalysts samples, the pores with sizes larger than 10 000 nm were excluded from consideration. The amounts OCP were determined by an increase in the sample weight.
The catalytic properties of samples in propane oxi- dative dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide were studied in a flow setup at an atmo- spheric pressure at 600-700 and a contact time of x = l0 s. A reaction mixture containing l0 vol % C3H 8, 10,l0 vol % SO 2, and 80 vol % He passed through a cata- lyst bed with 0.5-1.0-mm granules and a total volume of 1 cm 3 placed into a quartz reactor (an inner diameter of 3.5 mm and a reaction zone volume of 2.6 cm3).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Phase composition. According to X-ray phase analysis data described in Table 1, silica-alumina sam- ples contain alumina and silica, as well as the product of their interaction, mullite. The amounts of these phases are determined by the nature of aluminum-con- taining starting material, component ratio, and treat- ment temperature (Ttreat). Alumina in the samples cal- cined at 1000 are mainly in the form of 5-A1203 and 8-Al203-1ike, and o-AI203 (small amount) phases. An increase in the calcination temperature changes the ratio of phases and increases the concentration of ct-
AI203. Upon calcination at 1550
alumina is only present in the form of the s-phase. Silicon dioxide is present in all samples calcined at 1000 in the X-ray amorphous state. With an increase in the treatment tem- perature to 1250 silica is crystallized to form ct-cris- tobalite in the samples of series II and IV. In the sam- ples of series I, silica remains in the amorphous state.
Upon calcination at 1550 silicon dioxide is absent.
It is known that the stable phase of ct-cristobalite is formed by the treatment of pure silica gel only at 1470 [6]. The appearance of SiO2 at 1250 in the series II and IV is associated with the presence of sodium oxide in the starting material. Sodium oxide accelerates polymorphous transformations of silica. Mul- lite (Si2Al6Oi3) is formed only after calcination at 1550 independently of the nature of aluminum-con- taining starting material used in the sample preparation.
Textural characteristics of samples. Together with phase transformations, samples change their specific surface areas and pore structures. The specific surface area decreases with an increase in the treatment tem- peratures and with the replacement of aluminum hydroxide (series I) by alumina (series IV) (Table 2).
Because the pore structures of the compositions obtained by the method of wet mixing may include pores of three types (pores of initial species, pores formed by a "binding agent", and pores between parti- cles [7]), the pore size distribution can be changed by changing the nature of the initial aluminum-containing material. Indeed, Tables 1 and 2 show that the pore size distribution does depend on the nature of a starting material and their treatment temperature. We obtained the samples characterized by different meso- and macropore structures with mono- and polydispersed distributions of pore sizes. In the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the products of oxidative condensation are deposited on the catalyst surface (Table 2). After the reaction, their amount ranges from
1.4 to 34 wt % after 6 h depending on the sample. The
deposition of OCP depends on the initial specific sur- face area and pore volume: at a specific surface area of 34 and 3 m2/g (samples 3-5), the amount of coke is
6.5-26 wt %; an increase in the pore volume by a factor
of -4 (samples 1 and 13) does not change the amount of OCP (21 wt %). It was shown earlier [8] that, on sil- ica-alumina samples, coke is formed on certain surface sites, which are OH groups attached to silicon. The choice of the a starting material, as well as changing the concentration of SiO2 and catalyst treatment tempera- ture, change the concentration of these OH groups, and hence, the amount of OCP. On the samples calcined at 1550 the concentration of surface OH groups is

- much lower than in the samples calcined at a lower tem- perature. The amount of OCP is lower by an order of mag- nitude on the former samples (samples 6-9).
Coke deposits change the textural characteristics of silica-alumina samples (Table 2). The specific surface area of silica-alumina samples calcined at 1000- 1250 decreases during the reaction, and a decrease in Ssp depends on the sample series. The specific surface area of samples calcined at 1550 increases by a fac- tor of  1.4-3. With some exceptions, the overall pore volume of silica-alumina samples also decreases after 6 h of catalyst service. Simultaneously, the pore size distribution changes (Table 2): all samples reveal poly- dispersed distribution of pores over sizes. This fact sug- gests that OCP substantially affect the textural proper- ties of the samples. The maximal decrease in the overall pore volume, which is probably due to site blocking by OCP, is observed in the samples containing thin pores with radii from 4 to 10 nm.
Catalytic properties of samples. It is known that at high temperatures, the oxidation of propane can occur via heterogeneous, heterogeneous-homogeneous, and homogeneous mechanisms, depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst nature. Changes in the volume of the reaction zone and the catalyst-free volume of the reactor [5] allowed us to determine conditions at which the contribution of the homogeneous process is mini- mal. Table 3 shows that the propane conversion x is very small in the absence of the catalyst even if the con- ditions are optimal. Therefore, we neglected the homo- geneous component of the process.
In the study of solid catalysts, the reaction rate is usually a specific value that refers to the unit surface area [9]. However, it was found recently that the spe- cific catalyst activity in a number of reactions occurring via a heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism is basi- cally determined by the value of the total surface area if a series of similar catalysts are considered. The specific activity is describable by the law r s = A/(1 + BS), where 9 p S s the total surface area, A and B are the constants [10, 11]. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the appar- ent specific rate of propane conversion in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation at 640 and 700 The specific activity of the samples is inversely proportional to the total surface area and agrees well with the above regularities. At 600 and 550 no such regularities were observed. Therefore, the homoge- neous component of the reaction is absent. Process acceleration due to the chain reaction at a higher tem- perature and its transfer to the pore volume should cor- relate with the value of the free volume inside the cata- lyst. The catalysts with a higher surface area usually have pores with larger diameters, and the radical decay on the surface should dominate over chain propagation in the pore volume. Taking into account the above law,we further considered the reaction rate relatively to a sample weight in further studies of the effects of the size and volume of pores on the catalyst activity and selectivity.
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur diox- ide at 600-700 over the catalysts under study occurs via a complicated heterogeneous-homogeneous mech- anism. This reaction is accompanied by the formation

2, and coke; SO2 transforms into H2S, H20, and S. Table 3 shows how the catalytic properties of samples with the same composition change depending on the pore structure. Samples 1, 7,and 8 have a monodispersed pore structure with domi- nant pore radii of 7, 80, and 200 nm, respectively. Sam- ple 11 has a polydispersed pore distribution over sizes depending on the reaction temperature and contact time during the initial period of the reaction. It is seen that the pore structure of the samples affects the reaction direction at different temperatures. Sample 1 with fine pores differs from the others in its behavior. At 600- 700 it forms the maximal amount of carbon oxides and coke (the lowest balance with respect to carbon is observed). With an increase in the reaction tempera- ture, falls the yield of propylene to zero at 700 The main products formed on samples 7 and 8 at 600 and 640 are propylene and ethylene. At 700 the selec- tivity to propylene decreases and the yields of ethylene,methane and CO increases. Sample 11 has polydis- persed pore-size distribution over sizes. The selectivity to propylene is maximal at 640 The yields of ethyl- ene, methane, and CO are higher at 700 At 600 carbon oxides are the main products of the reaction.
A decrease in the contact time leads to a substantial decrease in the conversion of propane. The selectivity to olefins increases. We may assume that the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation is accompanied by w • 109, (mol C3H8) m

Apparent rate of propylene formation (at x = 60- 70%) vs. volume of pores with r = 10-100 nm at 640 (1) during the initial period of catalyst service and (2) after 6 h. are optimal for the formation of propylene and ethyl- ene, whereas large transport pores does not play a crit- ical role in the process under consideration.
Earlier, Demidov et al. [12] that the propane conver- sion and the selectivity to propylene in the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation increase for 3-5 h.
Demidov et al. associated this phenomenon with the accumulation of OCP. During the further 70-80 h, the activity and selectivity remained the same. The catalyst deactivation after 100 h was explained by a decrease in the volume of mesopores with r = 10-1000 nm. Taking these data into account, we studied the catalytic proper- ties of silica-alumina samples with different textural characteristics at early stages of the reaction and after 6-h service at 640 and x = 10 s. We found that, at the initial period, the conversion of propane and the selec- tivity to propylene are independent of the phase compo- sition, conditions for sample preparation, and SiO2 con- centration. They only depend on the pore structure. Fig- ure 2 shows that the higher the overall sample volume,the higher the rate of propane conversion. The apparent rate of propylene formation (Fig. 3) increases with an increase in the pore volume with r = 10-100 nm. After 6 h of the catalyst service, coke is formed on the surface in an amount of 1.4-34 wt % (Table 2) and changes the specific surface area, total pore volume, and their distri- bution over sizes. As this takes place, the dependence of the propane conversion rate and propylene yield on the pore volume does not change (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, dur- ing the reaction, the overall pore volume decreases (sample 1). The volume of pores with 10-100 nm increases (Table 2). Correspondingly, the apparent rate of propane conversion after 6-h catalyst service decreases from 8.73 x 10 -7 to 7.42 x 10 -7 (mol C3H8) (g Cat) -l s -l, and the apparent rate of propylene forma- tion increases from 1.06 x 10 -7 to 1.82 x 10 -7 (mol C3H6) (g Cat) -1 s -1. The apparent rates of methane and ethylene formation change likewise. In this experi- ment, we did not observe correlations between the amount of coke deposited for 6 h and catalytic proper- ties (activity and selectivity) of silica-alumina samples.
Thus, in this work we showed that the pore structure of the catalyst plays a key role in the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of sulfur dioxide at 600-700 The nature of pore distribution over sizes affects the process direction at different tem- peratures. Specifically, at 640 propane transforms into propylene more selectively in pores with r = 10- 100 nm. Finer pores with r < 10 nm are favorable for the formation of coke and oxidation products. The above regularities are explainable by the fact that, in the case of a heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism of the reaction, the portion of chemical transformations in the gas phase increases with an increase in temperature.A similar effect of pore diameter on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts was observed for methane oxidative coupling [13]. On the catalysts with pore diameters smaller than 20-50 nm (which is lower than the free path of reacting molecules), Knudsen diffusion regime was observed, and a decrease in the activity was associated with the decay of active methyl radicals in the catalyst pores. The use of the catalysts with fine pores in propane oxidative dehydrogenation leads to the retarded diffusion of initial reactants and products.An increase in the number of collisions between inter- mediate species in the pore volume and on the surface probably results in an increase in the rate of their oxidation into carbon oxides and olefin conversion into coke. .
