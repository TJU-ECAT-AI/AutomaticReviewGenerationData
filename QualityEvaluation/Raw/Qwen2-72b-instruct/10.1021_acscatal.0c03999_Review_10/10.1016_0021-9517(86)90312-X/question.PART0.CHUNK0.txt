September 17, 1985 Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spine1 is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high- temperature,long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.
Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25-500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.
Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 92-94% was maintained over six 24-h reactiomregenera- tion cycles at 600C.
Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles.
This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion,observed after each catalyst regeneration.
The deactivation oc- curred only in catalysts exposed to sulfur since coke burn-off did not cause platinum sintering in catalysts run without hydrogen sulfide addition to the feed.
Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments.
The results are discussed in terms of metal- support interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds. eo IM, Ac:demic Pm\\. Inc
INTRODUCTION
Platinum supported on magnesium alumi- nate (MgAl*OJ is remarkably stable (I, 2) in environments which lead to platinum sin- tering when silica (3), alumina (4), or sil- ica-alumina (5) are used as supports. The spine1 is therefore an attractive support for platinum-catalyzed reactions at high sever- ity.We have studied the dehydrogenation of propane, isobutane, and isopentane over platinum supported on magnesium alumi- nate, in the presence of excess hydrogen and at temperatures of 500-600C. Under these conditions, dehydrogenation could be carried out for extended periods at these temperatures and the catalyst oxidatively regenerated, without loss of catalytic activ- ity and with no significant change in plati- num dispersion. Platinum supported on sil- ica, -y-alumina and r]-alumina lost catalytic activity and showed pronounced growth in platinum crystallite size when used in com- parable cycles.Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H# or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over 23 platinum on magnesium aluminate. With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for ex- ample, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94s selectivity to propyl- ene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C. Sulfur addition eventually led to loss of catalyst activity,however,which was not observed in dehydrogena- tion/regeneration cycles in its absence. We show that the activity loss resulted from in- creases in platinum particle size which oc- curred during coke burn-off but only in catalysts exposed to sulfur during the dehydrogenation cycle. Exposure to sulfur had this effect despite reduction in pure hy- drogen at 600C prior to oxidative regenera- tion.
METHODS
The magnesium aluminate spinels used in this study were prepared by coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of Al(NO&
* 9H20
and Mg(NO& . 6H20 by addition to a solu- tion of NH40H at a pH of 10. The precipi- tate was dried at 120C for 16 h then calcined in two stages, first at 400C for 16 h, then at 600C for 16 h. X-Ray diffraction analysis showed the material to be MgA1204, having the spine1 structure. The 5

MgAl204 composition was confirmed by neutron activation analysis. The supported catalysts were prepared by impregnating the calcined MgA1204 with an aqueous solu- tion of chloroplatinic acid by the technique of minimum excess solution (incipient wet- ness). After impregnation,the catalysts were dried overnight at
120C
then calcined for 16 h at 500C. Platinum was supported on silica, q-alumina, and y-alu- mina following the same procedure.
All dehydrogenation experiments were carried out in a $-in. i.d. tubular quartz re- actor surrounded by a 13-in. tube furnace.
Furnace temperatures were controlled by a thermoelectronic regulator. Temperatures within the catalyst bed were determined by a movable thermocouple mounted in a con- centric thermocouple well running the length of the reactor.
All experiments were carried out at a 2- to-l or 3-to-l molar ratio of hydrogen to paraffin. Gas feeds were controlled by cali- brated gas flow regulators; liquid was sup- plied through either liquid flow regulators or mechanical pumps. The top section of the reactor was packed with corundum pel- lets and used to preheat and mix the feeds.
Sulfur was added to the feed either as H2S or thiophene. Catalyst charges of 10 cm3 of lo- to 20-mesh catalysts were used without dilution.
Before the reactions were carried out,the catalysts were prereduced in flowing hydrogen for at least 30 min at 500C.
Again, prior to regeneration, the catalysts were reduced in flowing hydrogen from 30 min to 2 h at reaction temperatures. Regen- erations were carried out at 450-500C in either flowing air or an air-helium mixture.
These were monitored by GLC and were considered complete when the production of COZ had ceased.
Platinum metal surface areas were deter- mined by hydrogen adsorption (6) or were calculated from platinum size distributions obtained from electron micrographs (6).
Hydrocarbon conversions and selectivi- ties were calculated from gas chromato- grams obtained with an 18-ft. by +-in. column of bisethoxy-2-ethyl sebacate at 25 or 50C using a thermoconductivity detec- tor. Unless otherwise stated, conversions and selectivities were determined over a standard 5-h reaction period. Values re- ported here are for the lined out catalyst and were taken at the end of the 5-h reac- tion period.
RESULTS
ParafJin Dehydrogenation Initial studies were carried out on the de- hydrogenation of isopentane to isoamyl- enes over platinum on various supports.
Table 1 lists results obtained for the dehy- drogenation of isopentane over 0.5% Pt supported on SiOz, r-A1,03, n-Al203 and MgAlzO+ After each 5-h reaction period,the catalysts were reduced and oxidatively regenerated. The most selective catalysts for this reaction were Pt/SiOz and Ptl MgA1204. The Pt/SiO, gave low isopentane conversion, however, and lost most of its activity upon regeneration.
Pt/MgAlZ04 gave higher conversion, initially, and could be regenerated repeatedly with no change in activity or selectivity. Neither Ptly-A1203 nor Pt/q-Alz03 was selective for dehydro- genation, and each tended to lose activity upon regeneration,although not to the same catastrophic extent as Pt/SiO,. Trans- mission electron microscopy showed that

The platinum-alumi- nas were intermediate in behavior.
A series of experiments was then carried out over Pt/MgA1204 wih trace quantities of sulfur (80-625 ppm) added to the feed as thiophene. Sulfur increased both isopen- tane conversion and selectivity to isoamyl- enes. Results of these experiments are shown in Table 2. The addition of 80 ppm sulfur increased selectivity to isoamylenes from 76 to 86 mol%. Further increases in sulfur concentration from 80 to 625 ppm had only a small effect on selectivity but did cause a significant increase in conversion due to decreased coke formation.
As a result, conversion was maintained at a high level over the entire reaction period. In subsequent experiments carried out at 525C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S, an average isopentane conversion of 30 mol% was obtained over a 48-h reaction period with a selectivity to isoamylenes of 96%.
Similar results were obtained for the dehy- drogenation of isobutane at 560C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H2S.

This reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl,OA in the absence of sulfur.The principal reaction was hydrogenolysis,with methane and coke the main products.The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall re- action became endothermic. Yields of pro- pylene increased dramatically and olefin se- lectivities of 90 mol% were obtained. Sulfur also decreased coke formation, as before,and reaction could be carried out for up to 10 days before regeneration became neces- sary. Table 3 shows the effect of sulfur ad- dition on the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAlzO,, Ptlq-AlzOs, and Ptly- A&O+ In the case of Pt/MgAl,O,, as little as 25 ppm sulfur increased propylene selectiv- ity from 47 to 84%. Ninety-five percent se- lectivity was obtained at 425 ppm sulfur.The addition of 425 ppm sulfur had little or no effect with Ptln-AlzO3, and 850 ppm sul- fur decreased both conversion and selectiv- ity with Ptly-AlzOj.Effect of Regeneration During the dehydrogenation of isopen- tane in the absence of sulfur, the Pt/ MgA1204 was regenerated repeatedly with no observable loss in catalyst activity.

Even in the presence of sulfur, no change in activity was observed after the catalyst had been subjected to five regenerations at 500C in flowing air. In dehydrogenating propane in the presence of sulfur, however,catalyst activity decreased after repeated regenerations. This loss of activity was nor- mally observed between the sixth and eighth regeneration. Table 4 shows the ef- fect of air regeneration on conversion and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of pro- pane with 200 ppm sulfur added as HzS.
The conversions and selectivities shown in Table 4 were determined at the end of 24-h reaction periods after which the catalyst was oxidatively regenerated. Catalyst ac- tivity decreased after the seventh regenera- tion and continued to decline after each subsequent regeneration.
Transmission electron micrographs were obtained for the fresh catalyst and for the catalyst after eight regenerations. They showed that platinum particles in the fresh catalyst were between 10 and 20 A in diam- eter, while those in the spent catalyst had grown to between 25 and 80 A in diameter.
The same experiment was repeated with another sample of Pt/MgAl,O,, but in this case the catalyst was sampled after each regeneration and transmission electron mi- crographs obtained for each sample. Plati- num crystallite size distributions were gen- erated from a large number of micrographs,sizing some 300-400 crystallites for each sample. It was found that platinum crystal- lite size increased continuously with each dehydrogenation-regeneration cycle. Fig- ure 1 (A-C) shows the platinum size distri- butions obtained for fresh catalyst, and the same catalyst after three and after eight re- generations. The progressive growth of platinum crystallite size is apparent.
These results were checked by hydrogen chemisorption measurements in a flow sys- tem. Good agreement was obtained with the fresh catalyst which had an H/Pt ratio of
0.71. None of the regenerated samples
would adsorb hydrogen. It was later deter- mined that this was only true for regener- ated catalysts which had been used in the presence of sulfur. Reasonable agreement was obtained between hydrogen adsorption and the electron microscope in the case of regenerated catalysts which had been run in the absence of sulfur.

First,two samples of Pt/ MgAl204 were run for 6 days at 6OOC,one in flowing hydrogen and one in hydrogen with 200 ppm H#. Hydrogen flow in each case was equivalent to that employed in the dehydrogenation experiments.
Platinum size distributions,determined after 6 days for each sample, are shown in Fig. 2. Nei- ther sample showed any significant increase in crystallite size. Hydrogen chemisorption on the sample run in hydrogen alone gave an H/Pt ratio of 0.69, identical to the value obtained with fresh catalyst. The sample run with sulfur adsorbed very little hydro- gen.
Experiments were next carried out to dif- ferentiate between the effects of the dehy- drogenation reaction itself and the regener- ation in air.

wt% PtLMgAlz04 after 7 days propane dehydrogena- tion (200 ppm H2S added), before and after regenera- tion.
Pt/MgA1204 were used for propane dehy- drogenation at 600C with 200 ppm sulfur added as H$. Reaction was continued for 7 days. At the end of this time, one sample was removed from the reactor without re- generation; the other was regenerated at the end of the reaction period. As shown in Fig. 3, platinum crystallite size in the cata- lyst run 7 days without regeneration was unchanged from that of fresh catalyst. Cat- alyst run 7 days with one regeneration was equivalent to samples run 1 day and regen- erated once. These results suggest that plat- inum crystallite size was unaffected by the dehydrogenation reaction but was a func- tion of the number of regenerations carried out.
To be completely sure, a large sample of
0.5% Pt/MgAlzOd was charged to the reac-
tor and run for 24 h at 600C. As before, the feed comprised propane, hydrogen and hy- drogen sulfide. After 24 h, the catalyst was 240

reduced in hydrogen for 2 h at 600C and cooled to room temperature in helium.
One-half of the catalyst was then removed from the reactor. The other half was given a standard regeneration, as described previ- ously, and cooled in helium. A small sam- ple of each half of the catalyst was removed for electron microscopy, the unregenerated half recharged, the entire charge given a standard pretreatment, and a second 24-h reaction period begun. This procedure was repeated six times. Examination of the samples generated in this experiment con- firmed that platinum sintering became pro- gressively worse with each regeneration and showed that all seven samples which had not been regenerated had good plati- num dispersion. The platinum crystallite size distribution obtained for catalyst run 7 days with no regeneration again was essen- tially the same as that of the fresh catalyst. 60 1 n 3

size distributions for 0.5 wt% Pt/MgAlzOd used 3 days for propane dehydro- genation at 600C (125 ppm H2S added) and used 3 days with three regenerations in air.
The sample run for 7 days with seven re- generations showed extensive growth in platinum crystallite size. Figure 4 compares platinum distributions for samples run for 3 days with no regeneration and 3 days with three regenerations. The change in plati- num size distribution is apparent in the sample regenerated three times.
Two further experiments of this type were carried out. In one case hydrogen sul- fide was withheld from the feed, while in the other, only hydrogen and hydrogen sul- fide were passed over the catalyst. (Obvi- ously no coke was formed in the latter ex- periment, but a series of pseudoregenera- tions was carried out under standard condi- tions.) It was hoped that these experiments would determine whether coke burn-off alone caused platinum sintering, or if the presence of sulfur in the feed was involved.
The study showed that sulfur is indeed an integral part of the sintering mechanism.
All 14 samples generated in the sulfur-free program had good platinum dispersions.
Large platinum crystals were not observed in any sample. Quantitative data were ob- tained for the final sample, regenerated seven times. The Pt size distribution ob- tained was very similar to that of fresh cata- lyst (Fig. 5). The sample run without pro- pane did not show the extensive platinum sintering observed previously. Qualitative examination of these 14 samples showed no substantial growth in platinum particle size.
Quantitative data for the sample given seven simulated regenerations showed a small increase in Pt crystallite size com- pared to fresh catalyst (Fig. 5), but this was small relative to the changes which oc- curred during the course of a normal run.
Thus, gross platinum sintering occurred only during carbon burn-off and then only when the catalyst had been run with sulfur present in the feed.
Platinum surface areas for some repre- sentative samples are given in Table 5.
These were calculated from the surface mean diameters of platinum crystallites in each sample, as determined by electron mi-

Pt/SiO, and Pt/MgAl,O,were comparable in selectivity, but conver- sion was much lower on Pt/SiO, than on any other catalyst. This we attribute to the calcination of Pt/SiOz in air at 500C prior to

An 0.5% Pt/q-A&O, catalyst was tested in the same way. Qualitatively, the electron microscope showed that platinum crystal- lite size was little affected by reduction in hydrogen for 4 days at 6OoC,and no signifi- cant sintering occurred after 4 days of pro- pane dehydrogenation at 600C. Thus the platinum in Pt/Al,O, behaved in much the same way as platinum in Pt/MgA1204 in re- ducing environments. Platinum in Pt/AI,O,was less stable in oxidizing environments.
Significant platinum sintering was observed in a sample run 4 days in hydrogen and given a simulated regeneration every 24 h.
A single regeneration after 24 h of propane dehydrogenation gave extensive sintering,and four such regenerations at 24-h inter- vals resulted in extremely large platinum crystals. Significantly, Pt/AI,O, run in hy- drogen at 600C with 125 ppm sulfur as H2S has little effect on platinum on the other supports .
For propane dehydrogenation,thermo- dynamics show that acceptable yields of propylene can be expected only at 600C and above in the presence of excess hydro- gen. At this temperature, hydrogenolysis and coke formation were substantial over all catalysts. Any influence of the support was overwhelmed by the hydrogenolysis activity of platinum itself at 6OoC, and ac- ceptable selectivity required suppression of this hydrogenolysis activity. The use of sul-

fur compounds to suppress hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum is well known, and hydrogen sulfide addition gave the needed change in selectivity (I). It also led to eventual platinum sintering and activ- ity loss in Pt/MgA1204, which was a remark- ably stable catalyst in the absence of sulfur.
The remainder of this discussion will be concerned with this effect of hydrogen sul- fide on the Pt/MgAl,O, catalyst.
The present results show that platinum dispersion was relatively stable on all sup- ports in reducing environments at 600C.
This was true in hydrogen, in hydrogen with added hydrogen sulfide, and also dur- ing propane dehydrogenation. Large differ- ences in the behavior of platinum on the various supports were observed only in the presence of oxygen at high temperatures.
As discussed previously, for example, cal- cination of Pt/Si02 catalysts in air at 500C leads to extensive platinum sintering (3, 6),yet this procedure is used routinely to cal- tine Pt/AlzO, catalysts without ill effect.
This suggests that there must be a mecha- nism for pinning or stabilizing oxidized platinum species in Pt/A1203 which is inop- erative in Pt/SiO,, an interaction which has been the subject of numerous studies (7- 15).
Platinum dispersion was even more sta- ble on magnesium aluminate than on alu- mina in the presence of oxygen at high tem- peratures. With Pt/Al,O, significant growth in platinum crystallite size was observed af- ter cycles of reduction in hydrogen (600C) followed by oxidation in air (500C). More extensive platinum sintering occurred dur- ing regeneration of Pt/A1203 in air after use as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
This sintering grew progressively worse af- ter each coke burn-off,and it occurred whether hydrogen sulfide was present in the propane feed or not. Pt/MgA1204, on the other hand, was stable in all experiments except those where coke was burned off a catalyst which had been exposed to hydro- gen sulfide during propane dehydrogena- tion.
Adamiec et aE. (16) studied the stability of platinum dispersion on magnesium ox- ide. Using hydrogen chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy,they showed that platinum sintering did not oc- cur in oxygen at 550-650C conditions which caused extensive platinum sintering in Pt/Al203 (16). The authors postulate that platinum forms PtO,-MgO complexes in the presence of oxygen at these tempera- tures, which stabilizes platinum to a greater extent than occurs in Pt/Al,O,.
The stability of Pt/MgA1204 in oxygen at high temperatures is more like that of Ptl MgO than Pt/Al,03. (Temperatures during coke burn-off must have exceeded the nom- inal 500C reactor temperature considera- bly, since undiluted air was used as oxi- dant.) Possibly surface oxide ions which have magnesium cations as neighbors pin PtO, species in much the same way as with magnesia itself, i.e., more strongly than in the case of alumina.
This still leaves the question of why the stability of Pt/MgAl,O, during coke burn- off was reduced if the catalyst was exposed to hydrogen sulfide during propane dehy- drogenation.
We suggest a reaction se- quence of the following type Pt, + H2S = P&(S), + HZ Pt,(S), + 02 = Pt, + so:! so* + 40, = so3 4s03 + MgAKh = Mi$04(,) + A12@04)3(s) where (a) denotes an adsorbed species and (s) a surface species, may lead to recon- struction of the support surface through sulfate formation and weaken the bonding between PtO, species and the spine1 surface during oxidative regeneration. Each of the reactions is thermodynamically favored at the conditions used in the present experi- ments, and flow microbalance studies car- ried out by Massoth (27) show that the re- actions do occur over Pt/MgAl204.

spheres. Treating Pt/MgA1204 with SOI and air gave a significant weight gain, i.e., sul- fate formation on the support. Subsequent hydrogen treatment gave a corresponding weight loss (sulfate reduction). When the same catalyst was treated with a HIS/H2 mixture followed by air, a similar weight gain was observed, showing that oxidation of adsorbed H2S will lead to sulfate forma- tion on the spine1 support. Again, the sul- fate could be reduced with hydrogen. X- Ray diffraction analysis of the reduced catalyst after this experiment showed a good spine1 pattern with no evidence of ei- ther MgO or A1203.
Significantly, however,the catalyst did show a strong pattern for platinum metal, indicating extensive plati- num sintering.
We have no direct evidence for sulfur re- tention in reduced PtMgAl,O, prior to coke burnoff. The sulfur content of samples re- duced at 600C before coke oxidation was below the detection limit of combustion methods. A recent study by Mathieu and Primet (Z8), however, provides direct evi- dence for a similar cycle on Pt/Al,O+ They found that H2S adsorbed dissociatively on Pt above 100C with release of hydrogen and full coverage of surface platinum atoms by sulfur. Oxygen treatments removed sul- fur from the platinum and led to formation of sulfate groups on the support which were detected by infrared spectroscopy. High- temperature treatment in hydrogen reduced these sulfate groups but led to renewed poi- soning of the platinum surface, as evi- denced by catalyst selectivity in several test reactions; a conclusion also reached in the work of Apesteguia ef al. (19) on sulfu- rized Pt/A1203.
This result demonstrates the formation and reduction of surface sulfate species in Pt/A1203 exposed to hydrogen sulfide, and the retention of sulfur by platinum, when the catalyst is reduced. The amount of sul- fur which could be retained in this way by
0.5% Pt/MgA1203 is sufficiently small to be
below the detection limit of the combustion method. We theorize that it could neverthe- less be sufficient to disrupt the bonding be- tween platinum and spine1 by the proposed mechanism if surface sulfate is formed in close proximity to the platinum crystallites.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
