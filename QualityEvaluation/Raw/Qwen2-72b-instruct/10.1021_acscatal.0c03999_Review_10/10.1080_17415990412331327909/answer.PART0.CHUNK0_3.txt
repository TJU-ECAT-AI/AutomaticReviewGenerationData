1.The literature does not provide a comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It focuses on the use of H2S as a promoter in the presence of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, achieving a propene yield of 30.4% at 700 C and 5 ms contact time. The specific challenges associated with H2S, such as byproduct formation, are not discussed. Future research could explore the effectiveness of other sulfur-based oxidants and their impact on propylene yield, as well as the development of catalysts that can optimize the overall process.

1.文献没有比较不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯中的效果。它专注于在V2O5/A12O3催化剂存在下使用H2S作为促进剂，实现了30.4%的丙烯产率，反应温度为700°C，接触时间为5毫秒。与H2S相关的具体挑战，如副产品的形成，并没有讨论。未来的研究可以探索其他硫基氧化剂的效果及其对丙烯产率的影响，以及开发可以优化整个过程的催化剂。
