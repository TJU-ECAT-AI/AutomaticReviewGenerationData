Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It focuses specifically on the use of H2S as a promoter in the presence of a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, showing that the introduction of H2S can significantly enhance the yield of propene. The study does not discuss the specific challenges associated with each oxidant or key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

1.The literature does not provide a comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) and conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. It focuses on the use of H2S as a promoter in the presence of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, achieving a propene yield of 30.4% at 700 C and 5 ms contact time. The specific challenges associated with H2S, such as byproduct formation, are not discussed. Future research could explore the effectiveness of other sulfur-based oxidants and their impact on propylene yield, as well as the development of catalysts that can optimize the overall process.

The literature focuses on the use of H2S as a promoter in the presence of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, achieving a high propene yield of 30.4% at short contact times and high temperatures. It does not provide information on the specific challenges associated with each oxidant or key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process for other sulfur-based oxidants.
