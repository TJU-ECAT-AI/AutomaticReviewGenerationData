The interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys significantly enhances their catalytic performance, selectivity, and reactivity compared to monometallic catalysts. In these alloys, the geometric arrangement of atoms creates unique active sites that are not present in pure metals, leading to improved catalytic activity. Additionally, the electronic structure of the alloy can be tuned by varying the composition and structure, which affects the adsorption and activation of reactants. This electronic tuning can lead to increased selectivity for desired products and higher reactivity. The synergistic effect of these geometric and electronic factors in transition-metal alloys makes them highly effective catalysts for a wide range of chemical reactions.
