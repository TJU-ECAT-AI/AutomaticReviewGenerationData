[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
[4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
[5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
[6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
[7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
[8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by allowing the tuning of reaction selectivity and reactivity. Electronic effects refer to the strength of adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, influenced by charge transfer and hybridization, while geometric effects relate to bonding configuration. Charge transfer and changes in orbital overlap due to nuclear distance and orbital extent modification can perturb the d-band, affecting adsorption behavior. However, electronic modifications often affect all reactants and products similarly, limiting improvement potential. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of adsorbates must be perturbed, which can be achieved through intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers. These strategies can lead to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能，允许调整反应选择性和反应性。电子效应指的是吸附物与金属表面相互作用的强度，受电荷转移和杂化的影响，而几何效应与键合配置有关。电荷转移和由于核间距和轨道范围修改导致的轨道重叠变化可以扰动d带，影响吸附行为。然而，电子修饰通常会以类似的方式影响所有反应物和产物，限制了改进的潜力。为了打破这些限制，必须扰动吸附物的键合配置，这可以通过间金属化合物、单原子合金和共吸附结构修饰剂来实现。这些策略可以导致设计出更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统，其性能超过传统的单金属催化剂。
