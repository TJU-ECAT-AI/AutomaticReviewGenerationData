[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
[4] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
[5] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
[6] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[7] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by allowing better tailoring of reaction selectivity and tuning of metal reactivity. Electronic effects refer to the strength of adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while geometric effects relate to bonding configuration. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band filling and thus the adsorption behavior of alloys. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength often affects all reactants and products similarly, limiting improvements. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed, which can be achieved through intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting the interplay between geometric and electronic effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能，通过更好地调整反应选择性和调节金属活性。电子效应指的是吸附物与金属表面相互作用的强度，而几何效应与键合配置有关。杂化的变化可以以各种方式表现出来，影响d带填充，从而影响合金的吸附行为。然而，吸附物结合强度的电子修改通常对所有反应物和产物产生类似的影响，限制了改进的程度。为了打破这些限制，必须扰动吸附物的键合配置，这可以通过金属间化合物、单原子合金和共吸附结构修饰剂来实现。通过利用几何和电子效应之间的相互作用，可以开发创新策略，设计出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性、更可调的催化系统。
