[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
[4] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
[5] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
[6] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[7] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a crucial role in catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. These effects can be manipulated to tailor reaction selectivity and tune reactivity. Changes in hybridization can lead to shifts in the d-band center, affecting adsorption behavior. However, electronic modifications may not always lead to significant improvements in catalysis due to similar effects on reactants and products. To overcome this, the bonding configuration of adsorbates must be perturbed. Strategies such as intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers offer innovative ways to exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应在催化性能中起着关键作用。几何效应指的是键合配置，而电子效应则与吸附物与金属表面的相互作用强度相关。这些效应可以被操纵以定制反应选择性和调节反应性。杂化的变化可以导致d带中心的偏移，影响吸附行为。然而，电子修饰可能并不总是导致催化作用的显著改善，因为对反应物和产物的影响相似。为了克服这一点，必须扰动吸附物的键合配置。诸如金属间化合物、单原子合金和共吸附结构修饰剂等策略提供了创新的方法来利用几何和电子效应之间的相互作用，从而导致更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统，其性能超过传统的单金属催化剂。
