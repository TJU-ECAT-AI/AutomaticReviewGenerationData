[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
[4] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
[5] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
[6] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[7] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by allowing the tuning of reaction selectivity and reactivity. Electronic effects refer to the strength of adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band filling of metal atoms in contact with adsorbates. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength often affects all reactants and products similarly, limiting improvements. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of adsorbates must be perturbed, which can be achieved through intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应通过允许调节反应选择性和反应性，协同影响催化性能。电子效应指的是吸附物与金属表面相互作用的强度，而几何效应指的是键合配置。杂化的变化可以以各种方式表现出来，影响与吸附物接触的金属原子的d带填充。然而，吸附物结合强度的电子修饰通常对所有反应物和产物产生类似的影响，限制了改进的程度。为了打破这些限制，必须扰动吸附物的键合配置，这可以通过间金属化合物、单原子合金和共吸附结构修饰剂来实现。
