[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
[4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
[5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
[6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
[7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
[8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys work together to influence catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into charge transfer and hybridization effects. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band center and the adsorption behavior of alloys. Charge transfer can result in the stabilization of d-orbitals and a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength may limit improvements in catalysis. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能。几何效应指的是键合配置，而电子效应与吸附物与金属表面的相互作用强度有关。d带的扰动可以分解为电荷转移和杂化效应。杂化的变化可以以多种方式表现，影响d带中心和合金的吸附行为。电荷转移可以导致d轨道的稳定和费米能级附近d轨道密度的耗尽。然而，吸附物结合强度的电子修饰可能会限制催化性能的提高。为了打破这些限制，必须扰动吸附物的键合配置。利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括金属间化合物、单原子合金和共吸附结构修饰剂。
