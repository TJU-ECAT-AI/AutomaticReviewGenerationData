[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
[2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
[3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
[4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
[5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
[6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
[7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."

1.The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is influenced by both electronic and geometric effects, which are difficult to separate experimentally. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the underlying microscopic factors. The interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Both geometric and ligand effects should be considered when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The ligand effect can be well studied through electronic structure calculations. Some bimetallic systems, like PtRu, exhibit properties that surpass those of their pure components, while others, like PdCu, behave like a new metal with intermediate properties.

1.双金属基底的反应性受到电子效应和几何效应的共同影响，这些效应在实验中很难分开。电子结构计算可以帮助识别潜在的微观因素。双金属系统中的原子间距离可以显著影响其催化活性。在讨论双金属系统的反应性时，应同时考虑几何效应和配体效应。配体效应可以通过电子结构计算得到很好的研究。有些双金属系统，如PtRu，表现出的性质超越了其纯组分，而另一些，如PdCu，则像一种具有中间性质的新金属。
