[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
[2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
[3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
[4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
[5] "There are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
[6] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
[7] "The electronic and chemical properties of pseudo- morphic overlayers are modified mainly because of two effects, the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain in the overlayers induced by the lattice mismatch between substrate and the overlayers."
[8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
[9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
[10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
[11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
[12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
[13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
[14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
[15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
[16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
[17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
[18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
[19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
[20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."
[21] "This demonstrates the strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate."
[22] "The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an inter- mediate behavior."
[23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
[24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
[25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
[26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a synergistic role in influencing catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应在催化性能中起着协同作用。电子结构计算可以帮助识别双金属系统反应性的微观因素。双金属系统中原子间距离的修改可以显著影响其催化活性。当讨论双金属系统的反应性时，应考虑几何效应，与集合效应和配体效应一起。像PtRu这样的双金属系统表现出超越纯组分的性质，而像PdCu这样的系统则表现出中间行为。伪形态覆盖层的电子和化学性质主要由基底和覆盖层之间的电子相互作用以及由晶格失配引起的应变修改。实验上，很难区分应变效应和电子相互作用效应。Ru与Pt的强烈相互作用导致局部d带中心的下移，从而降低CO的结合能。双金属表面合金提供了双功能机制的可能性，其中一种物种可以吸附一种反应物，另一种物种可以吸附另一种反应物以进行所需的反应。Pt与Ru的混合导致CO结合力减弱，而Ru与Pt的混合导致CO结合力增强。这种混合增强了Pt和Ru位点之间CO吸附能的差异，而不是导致中间行为。对于CuPd(111)合金的CO吸附，电子结构计算中发现了类似的结果。PdCu合金中的相互作用导致Pd上的CO结合力减弱，而Cu上的CO相互作用增强。由于Cu和Pd之间的强烈相互作用，CuPd合金不作为双功能催化剂。相反，它们形成一种相对均匀的新金属，具有介于单组分之间的中间性质。通过比较沉积在Au(111)和Pd(111)上的Pd3簇以及自由Pd3簇的轨道分辨d带局域态密度(LDOS)，分析了Pd簇与金属基底的电子耦合。自由簇的LDOS由孤立的离散峰组成，而Pd3/Pd(111)簇的所有d态都显著展宽，表明簇与基底之间存在强烈的耦合。支持的Pd3/Au(111)簇表现出中间行为，簇层内受限的d带轨道显示出离散结构，而具有垂直z方向分量的其他三个轨道是局域化的。Pd和Au状态之间存在显著的电子耦合，但不如Pd3簇中Pd状态与基底之间的耦合强。
