[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
[2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
[3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
[4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
[5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
[6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
[7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can decisively influence its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered together with ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The ligand effect can be well studied in electronic structure calculations. Some bimetallic systems, like PtRu, exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others, like PdCu, act like a novel metal with intermediate properties.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能。电子结构计算可以识别双金属系统反应性的微观因素。双金属系统中原子间距离的改变可以决定性地影响其催化活性。在讨论双金属系统的反应性时，应将几何效应与集合效应和配体效应一起考虑。配体效应可以在电子结构计算中得到很好的研究。一些双金属系统，如PtRu，表现出超越纯组分的性质，而另一些，如PdCu，则像一种具有中间性质的新金属。
