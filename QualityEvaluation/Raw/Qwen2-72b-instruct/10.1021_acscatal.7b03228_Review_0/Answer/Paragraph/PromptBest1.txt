The interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys significantly enhances catalytic performance, selectivity, and reactivity compared to monometallic catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2014.07.016\]. These effects synergistically influence catalytic activity by altering bonding configurations and adsorbate interaction strength \[10.1021/acscatal.7b03228_0\]. Perturbation of the d-band through charge transfer and hybridization changes adsorption behavior, stabilizing d-orbitals and affecting d-orbital density \[10.1007/s11244-006-0005-x\]. Understanding the modifications in electronic properties, facilitated by DFT calculations, is pivotal for explaining metal surface reactivity \[10.1080/08927022.2010.481794\]. Bimetallic systems like PtRu and PdCu exemplify this, with PtRu exhibiting properties beyond its components and PdCu showing intermediate behavior \[10.1007/s11244-006-0005-x\]. The electrooxidation of CO and H2/CO mixtures on a Pt3Sn electrode surface highlights the synergistic effects of alloy composition on catalytic activity \[10.1021/j100022a002\].
