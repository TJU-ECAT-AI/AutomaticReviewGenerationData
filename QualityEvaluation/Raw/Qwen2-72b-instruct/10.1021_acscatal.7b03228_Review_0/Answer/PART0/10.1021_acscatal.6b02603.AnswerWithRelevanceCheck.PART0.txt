          [1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

          [2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."

It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."

          [1] "A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections."
          [2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
          [3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
          [4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
          [5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
          [6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
          [7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
          [8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
          [9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
          [10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
          [11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
          [13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."
          [15] "The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high."
          [16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
          [17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."

          [20] "To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials."

          The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic state of the active metal. The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

          过渡金属合金的几何和电子效应可以通过改变催化剂表面的几何环境和修改活性金属的电子状态来协同影响催化性能。集合效应是一种几何效应，可以通过减少表面的配位数和金属集合体的大小来增加允许反应的选择性。电子效应可以通过改变活性金属的电子状态来改善催化性能，这可以通过选择适当的第二金属来控制。通过利用这些效应，可以开发出更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统，以超越传统的单金属催化剂。例如，金属间相可以提供锚定位点，修改吸附性质，并实现选择性(去)氢化中的分子识别。它们还可以抑制不需要的副反应，提高催化剂稳定性，提供O2吸附位点，并作为氧化和蒸汽重整中活性组分的前体。为了发展对金属间催化剂化学的全面理解，希望具有高相纯度，使用惰性支撑或块体材料，并具有简单的反应条件。
