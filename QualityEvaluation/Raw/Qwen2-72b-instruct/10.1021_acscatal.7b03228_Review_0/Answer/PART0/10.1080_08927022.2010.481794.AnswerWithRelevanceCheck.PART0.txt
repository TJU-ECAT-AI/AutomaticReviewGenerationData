          [1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

          The reactivity of transition and noble metals is determined by surface properties that influence the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds. These properties include the surface d-band center, the degree of filling of the d-bands, and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms. The d-band model assumes that variations in coupling between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to variations in the coupling of metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is influenced by the average energy of the d-bands, sensitive to factors such as strain and ligand effects. Understanding the modifications of electronic properties in relation to different electronic and geometric effects is crucial for explaining the reactivity of metal surfaces. This can be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can determine the role of electronic and geometric effects separately. The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment. Establishing this understanding would enable the calculation of d-band characteristics for any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with a significantly reduced need for DFT calculations. This would provide a new and fast method for screening potential alloy surfaces, potentially including many different surface structures to identify surfaces with desired chemical properties.

          过渡金属和贵金属的反应性由决定金属原子形成和断裂键能力的表面性质决定。这些性质包括表面d带中心、d带的填充程度以及吸附物与表面金属原子之间的耦合矩阵元素。d带模型假设吸附物与表面金属原子之间的耦合变化主要是由于金属d态与吸附物轨道之间的耦合变化，这种变化受d带平均能量的影响，对包括应变和配位效应在内的多种因素敏感。理解与不同电子和几何效应相关的电子性质的修改对于解释金属表面的反应性至关重要。这可以通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来实现，DFT计算可以分别确定电子和几何效应的作用。通过表面d带宽度与描述原子与其环境之间键合相互作用的原子间矩阵元素之间的相关性，可以估计d带特性的变化。建立这种理解将使我们能够计算任何表面的d带特性，包括结构、合金化等效应，大大减少了对DFT计算的需求。这将提供一种新的快速筛选潜在合金表面的方法，甚至可以扩展到包括许多不同的表面结构，以识别具有所需化学性质的表面。
