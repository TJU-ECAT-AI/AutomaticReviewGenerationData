Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized.

The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Electronically, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can alter the d-band filling, potentially affecting the catalytic activity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay could include designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and dispersion, where the geometric arrangement and electronic properties of the metal atoms are tailored to enhance selectivity and activity for specific reactions.\n1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and high dispersions, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity for carbon-carbon bond rupture in hydrogenolysis reactions while having a smaller effect on other reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. This selectivity is influenced by geometric factors, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, and electronic factors, such as the interaction between different metal atoms.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure and surface composition of the catalyst. The electronic factor, as described by Mott and Jones, involves the filling of the d band in alloys of group 8 and group 1B metals, which can affect catalytic activity. Geometric factors, such as the arrangement of metal atoms at the surface, can also play a crucial role in determining selectivity, particularly in reactions requiring specific surface sites for different types of reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic systems, or bimetallic cluster catalysts, which can exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis and have compositions outside the range possible in bulk solid solutions. These catalysts can be prepared by dispersing metals on a carrier, resulting in very small metal clusters with a high surface area, which can lead to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems compared to traditional monometallic catalysts.", "Chinese": "1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以通过多种方式协同影响催化性能。电子上，当具有不完全填充的d带的第8族金属（如镍）与具有填充的d带的第1B族金属（如铜）合金化时，合金的d带填充程度大于纯第8族金属。这可以改变合金的电子结构和键合性质，可能影响其催化活性和选择性。几何上，表面中不活跃的外来金属原子的存在可以影响催化作用的活性位点的可用性和性质。例如，如果一个反应需要由多个相邻的活性金属原子组成的表面位点，而另一个反应只需要一个活性金属原子的位点，前者对表面中不活跃的外来金属原子的加入更敏感。这可以导致选择性效应，其中向第8族金属添加第1B族金属可以降低后者对需要活性金属原子多重位点的反应的活性，而对其他反应的影响较小。利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括开发高度分散的双金属簇，其中金属原子的分散可以被控制以优化电子和几何效应之间的平衡。通过改变双金属簇的组成和分散，可能设计出更有效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统，其性能超过传统的单金属催化剂。\n1. 过渡金属合金中的电子和几何效应可以协同影响催化性能。从电子学角度来看，将1B族金属添加到8族金属中可以改变d带填充，可能影响催化活性。从几何学角度来看，表面存在不活跃的外来金属原子可以影响需要特定活性金属原子位点的反应的选择性。为了利用这种相互作用，可以开发创新策略，包括设计具有受控表面组成和分散度的双金属催化剂，其中金属原子的几何排列和电子性质被调整以增强对特定反应的选择性和活性。\n1. 过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以协同影响催化性能。电子带理论描述了第8族金属如镍具有不完全填充的d带，而第1B族金属如铜具有填充的d带。当这些金属形成合金时，d带的填充程度比纯第8族金属更高。这可以通过改变d带中电子的填充程度来改变催化活性。然而，最近的观点表明，合金中每种成分都有单独的d带，而不同类型的表面原子，如镍和铜，保留了它们的化学差异，尽管它们的键合性质可能被改变。双金属催化剂的选择性特征直到最近才受到关注，人们意识到双金属系统在催化中可能表现出主要的选择性效应。将第1B族金属添加到第8族金属中可以显著降低后者在烃类氢解反应中碳-碳键断裂的活性，但对其他烃类反应的影响要小得多。表面的几何因素，如不同反应所需的相邻活性金属原子的数量，可以在确定选择性方面发挥关键作用。可以通过设计具有受控表面组成和高分散度的双金属催化剂来开发创新策略，从而产生更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统，超越传统的单金属催化剂。\n1. 过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以通过改变催化剂的电子结构和表面组成来协同影响催化性能。将1B族金属添加到8族金属中可以减少碳-碳键断裂在氢解反应中的活性，而对其他反应如氢化和脱氢化的影响较小。这种选择性受几何因素的影响，例如不同反应所需的相邻活性金属原子的数量，以及电子因素，例如不同金属原子之间的相互作用。利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括开发高度分散的双金属簇，它们可以具有超出块体固溶体范围的组成，并对特定反应表现出增强的选择性。\n1. 过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以通过改变催化剂的电子结构和表面组成来协同影响催化性能。Mott和Jones描述的电子因素涉及8族和1B族金属合金中d带的填充，这可能会影响催化活性。几何因素，如金属原子在表面的排列，也可能在确定选择性方面发挥关键作用，特别是在需要不同类型的反应的特定表面位点的反应中。利用这种相互作用的创新策略包括开发高度分散的双金属系统，或双金属簇催化剂，这些系统在催化中可能表现出重大的选择性效应，并且具有超出块体固溶体可能范围的组成。这些催化剂可以通过在载体上分散金属来制备，形成具有高表面积的非常小的金属簇，这可以导致与传统单金属催化剂相比更高效、更有选择性和可调的催化系统。", "Doi": "10.1021/ar50109a003"},

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.", "Chinese": "过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应在催化性能中起着协同作用。电子结构计算可以帮助识别双金属系统反应性的微观因素。双金属系统中原子间距离的修改可以显著影响其催化活性。当讨论双金属系统的反应性时，应考虑几何效应，与集合效应和配体效应一起。像PtRu这样的双金属系统表现出超越纯组分的性质，而像PdCu这样的系统则表现出中间行为。伪形态覆盖层的电子和化学性质主要由基底和覆盖层之间的电子相互作用以及由晶格失配引起的应变修改。实验上，很难区分应变效应和电子相互作用效应。Ru与Pt的强烈相互作用导致局部d带中心的下移，从而降低CO的结合能。双金属表面合金提供了双功能机制的可能性，其中一种物种可以吸附一种反应物，另一种物种可以吸附另一种反应物以进行所需的反应。Pt与Ru的混合导致CO结合力减弱，而Ru与Pt的混合导致CO结合力增强。这种混合增强了Pt和Ru位点之间CO吸附能的差异，而不是导致中间行为。对于CuPd(111)合金的CO吸附，电子结构计算中发现了类似的结果。PdCu合金中的相互作用导致Pd上的CO结合力减弱，而Cu上的CO相互作用增强。由于Cu和Pd之间的强烈相互作用，CuPd合金不作为双功能催化剂。相反，它们形成一种相对均匀的新金属，具有介于单组分之间的中间性质。通过比较沉积在Au(111)和Pd(111)上的Pd3簇以及自由Pd3簇的轨道分辨d带局域态密度(LDOS)，分析了Pd簇与金属基底的电子耦合。自由簇的LDOS由孤立的离散峰组成，而Pd3/Pd(111)簇的所有d态都显著展宽，表明簇与基底之间存在强烈的耦合。支持的Pd3/Au(111)簇表现出中间行为，簇层内受限的d带轨道显示出离散结构，而具有垂直z方向分量的其他三个轨道是局域化的。Pd和Au状态之间存在显著的电子耦合，但不如Pd3簇中Pd状态与基底之间的耦合强。", "Doi": "10.1007/s11244-006-0005-x"},

{"Quotes": "In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.\nAccording to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.\nIn the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.\nThis model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.\nIn any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.\nThe selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.\nEarly studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.\nIt has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\nWhile an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.\nIf one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.\nFur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.\nIn general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.\nFor a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.\nThe resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.\nThe dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.\nIn some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking.

The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu.

{"Quotes": "In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.\nAccording to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.\nIn the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.\nThis model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.\nIn any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.\nThe selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.\nEarly studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.\nIt has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.\nWhile an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.\nIf one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.\nFur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.\nIn general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.\nFor a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.\nThe resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.\nThe dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.\nIn some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized.

The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Electronically, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can alter the d-band filling, potentially affecting the catalytic activity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay could include designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and dispersion, where the geometric arrangement and electronic properties of the metal atoms are tailored to enhance selectivity and activity for specific reactions.\n1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized.

The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Electronically, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can alter the d-band filling, potentially affecting the catalytic activity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay could include designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and dispersion, where the geometric arrangement and electronic properties of the metal atoms are tailored to enhance selectivity and activity for specific reactions.\n1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized.

The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Electronically, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can alter the d-band filling, potentially affecting the catalytic activity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay could include designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and dispersion, where the geometric arrangement and electronic properties of the metal atoms are tailored to enhance selectivity and activity for specific reactions.\n1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized.

The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.\nResearch in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.\nThe reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,\nEvidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,\nThe addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.\nThe strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.\nThe data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.\nIf the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.\nFor com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.\nThe individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.\nA more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.\nWhile the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.\nRuthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.\nIn bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.\nIn the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.\nHowever, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.\nThus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.\nSimilarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.\nIn addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.\nThese include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.\nAll of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.\nA striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:\nThe effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.\nIn the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.\nFurther addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.\nHowever, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.\nAs the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.\nIn the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -\nC,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments\nThe adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.\nThe symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.\nIn a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).\nThe term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.\nAs the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.\nIf the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.\nAccording to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.\nWhile such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.\nSuch an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,\nIn view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.\nIn ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.\nOne would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.\nIf carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.\nThe markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.\nThere is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,\nWhile this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.\nIf addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.\nHowever, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.\nIt is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.\nThe range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be\nA supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.\nThe material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.\nThis procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.\nThe nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.\nWill the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?\nOne might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.\nThis expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O\nExamples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.\nCatalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.\nThe at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from\n0 to 1.\nThe degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.\nBy contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.\nThe absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.\nThe observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.\nDirect experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.\nIn such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.\nFor supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.\nIn applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.\nData on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.\nA measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.\nThis makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.\nSuch a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only\nThe data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.\nSince incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.\nIt is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.\nA comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.\nThe dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.\nThe presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.\nThe same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.\nA similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.\nClearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.\nThe required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.\nThis indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.\nIf one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.\nFrom this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.\nAs a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l\nHowever, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.\nOthers include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.\nOur present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.\nHowever, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.\nAs already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.\nIn recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.\nIt has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .\nThe application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.", "English": "1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.\n1.

Electronically, the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can alter the d-band filling, potentially affecting the catalytic activity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the selectivity of reactions that require specific active metal atom sites. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay could include designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and dispersion, where the geometric arrangement and electronic properties of the metal atoms are tailored to enhance selectivity and activity for specific reactions.\n1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.", "Chinese": "过渡金属合金的几何和电子效应可以通过改变催化剂表面的几何环境和修改活性金属的电子状态来协同影响催化性能。集合效应是一种几何效应，可以通过减少表面的配位数和金属集合体的大小来增加允许反应的选择性。电子效应可以通过改变活性金属的电子状态来改善催化性能，这可以通过选择适当的第二金属来控制。通过利用这些效应，可以开发出更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统，以超越传统的单金属催化剂。例如，金属间相可以提供锚定位点，修改吸附性质，并实现选择性(去)氢化中的分子识别。它们还可以抑制不需要的副反应，提高催化剂稳定性，提供O2吸附位点，并作为氧化和蒸汽重整中活性组分的前体。为了发展对金属间催化剂化学的全面理解，希望具有高相纯度，使用惰性支撑或块体材料，并具有简单的反应条件。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.6b02603"},
{"Quotes": "No specific quotes were provided in the answers.", "English": "The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.", "Chinese": "文献讨论了过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的作用，特别是在PtSn基催化剂中，用于脱氢反应。在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn会同时改变铂活性相和载体，抑制氢解和异构化反应，最小化金属烧结，中和载体的酸性，并促进焦炭物种从金属表面向载体的扩散。形成PtSn合金和/或部分覆盖铂颗粒的锡物种会导致形成较小的铂集合体，可以抑制结构敏感反应，如焦化。Sn对Pt的电子改性被认为在抑制焦炭形成中起着重要作用，通过增加铂的电子密度，削弱与锡紧密接触的铂原子上乙基化物的吸附。这些效应可以导致Pt和Sn的最佳比例，建议为Pt3Sn。Sn添加的几何和电子效应之间的平衡导致具有高活性和选择性的脱氢反应的催化剂。利用这种相互作用的策略可能包括使用高通量筛选方法来确定最佳合金组成，使用理论计算来预测合金化对催化性能的影响，以及开发新的合成方法来精确控制合金催化剂的组成和结构。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
