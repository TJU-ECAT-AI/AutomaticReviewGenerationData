The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of the catalyst. When metals are alloyed, two effects occur simultaneously: charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals, and changes in the hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important for catalysts, it is often unknown which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys work together to influence catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into charge transfer and hybridization effects. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band center and the adsorption behavior of alloys. Charge transfer can result in the stabilization of d-orbitals and a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength may limit improvements in catalysis. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a synergistic role in influencing catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.

The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does discuss the electrooxidation of CO and H2/CO mixtures on a well-characterized Pt3Sn electrode surface, which could be relevant to understanding the synergistic effects of alloy composition on catalytic activity.

The reactivity of transition and noble metals is determined by surface properties that influence the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds. These properties include the surface d-band center, the degree of filling of the d-bands, and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms. The d-band model assumes that variations in coupling between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to variations in the coupling of metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is influenced by the average energy of the d-bands, sensitive to factors such as strain and ligand effects. Understanding the modifications of electronic properties in relation to different electronic and geometric effects is crucial for explaining the reactivity of metal surfaces. This can be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can determine the role of electronic and geometric effects separately. The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment. Establishing this understanding would enable the calculation of d-band characteristics for any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with a significantly reduced need for DFT calculations. This would provide a new and fast method for screening potential alloy surfaces, potentially including many different surface structures to identify surfaces with desired chemical properties.

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and high dispersions, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the introduction of a second metal can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing its reactivity and selectivity. The study also observes that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that geometric changes in the catalyst surface can affect the adsorption and reaction of molecules.

This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalysts by control of the Sn concentration.

However, it does present a scheme for estimating oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, which could potentially be used to screen such alloys for desirable catalytic properties. The scheme incorporates the effects of changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects into the binding energy analysis through a single parameter, the surface d-band center. The agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on a large number of binary alloys is remarkably good, supporting the notion that the d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for a broad range of alloy systems.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the relative chemical reactivity of alloy sites based on their geometric structure and electronic properties. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationship between the alloy's geometric structure and the electronic properties of the d-band, which can be used to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic state of the active metal. The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.

The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.

The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of the catalyst. When metals are alloyed, two effects occur simultaneously: charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals, and changes in the hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important for catalysts, it is often unknown which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys work together to influence catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into charge transfer and hybridization effects. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band center and the adsorption behavior of alloys. Charge transfer can result in the stabilization of d-orbitals and a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength may limit improvements in catalysis. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a synergistic role in influencing catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.

The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does discuss the electrooxidation of CO and H2/CO mixtures on a well-characterized Pt3Sn electrode surface, which could be relevant to understanding the synergistic effects of alloy composition on catalytic activity.

The reactivity of transition and noble metals is determined by surface properties that influence the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds. These properties include the surface d-band center, the degree of filling of the d-bands, and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms. The d-band model assumes that variations in coupling between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to variations in the coupling of metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is influenced by the average energy of the d-bands, sensitive to factors such as strain and ligand effects. Understanding the modifications of electronic properties in relation to different electronic and geometric effects is crucial for explaining the reactivity of metal surfaces. This can be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can determine the role of electronic and geometric effects separately. The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment. Establishing this understanding would enable the calculation of d-band characteristics for any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with a significantly reduced need for DFT calculations. This would provide a new and fast method for screening potential alloy surfaces, potentially including many different surface structures to identify surfaces with desired chemical properties.

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity.

The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the introduction of a second metal can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing its reactivity and selectivity. The study also observes that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that geometric changes in the catalyst surface can affect the adsorption and reaction of molecules.

This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalysts by control of the Sn concentration.

The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does present a scheme for estimating oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, which could potentially be used to screen such alloys for desirable catalytic properties. The scheme incorporates the effects of changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects into the binding energy analysis through a single parameter, the surface d-band center. The agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on a large number of binary alloys is remarkably good, supporting the notion that the d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for a broad range of alloy systems.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the relative chemical reactivity of alloy sites based on their geometric structure and electronic properties. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationship between the alloy's geometric structure and the electronic properties of the d-band, which can be used to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the geometric and electronic effects of alloying can influence catalytic performance. The literature also shows that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that alloying can alter the reactivity of the surface. These observations may be exploited in practical catalysts by controlling the Sn concentration.

The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does present a scheme for estimating oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, which could potentially be used to screen such alloys for desirable catalytic properties. The scheme incorporates the effects of changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects into the binding energy analysis through a single parameter, the surface d-band center. The agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on a large number of binary alloys is remarkably good, supporting the notion that the d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for a broad range of alloy systems.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the relative chemical reactivity of alloy sites based on their geometric structure and electronic properties. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationship between the alloy's geometric structure and the electronic properties of the d-band, which can be used to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic state of the active metal. The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.

The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of the catalyst. When metals are alloyed, two effects occur simultaneously: charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals, and changes in the hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important for catalysts, it is often unknown which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys work together to influence catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into charge transfer and hybridization effects. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band center and the adsorption behavior of alloys. Charge transfer can result in the stabilization of d-orbitals and a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength may limit improvements in catalysis. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a synergistic role in influencing catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.

The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does discuss the electrooxidation of CO and H2/CO mixtures on a well-characterized Pt3Sn electrode surface, which could be relevant to understanding the synergistic effects of alloy composition on catalytic activity.

The reactivity of transition and noble metals is determined by surface properties that influence the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds. These properties include the surface d-band center, the degree of filling of the d-bands, and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms. The d-band model assumes that variations in coupling between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to variations in the coupling of metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is influenced by the average energy of the d-bands, sensitive to factors such as strain and ligand effects. Understanding the modifications of electronic properties in relation to different electronic and geometric effects is crucial for explaining the reactivity of metal surfaces. This can be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can determine the role of electronic and geometric effects separately. The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment. Establishing this understanding would enable the calculation of d-band characteristics for any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with a significantly reduced need for DFT calculations. This would provide a new and fast method for screening potential alloy surfaces, potentially including many different surface structures to identify surfaces with desired chemical properties.

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and high dispersions, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the introduction of a second metal can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing its reactivity and selectivity. The study also observes that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that geometric changes in the catalyst surface can affect the adsorption and reaction of molecules.

However, it does show that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalysts by control of the Sn concentration.

The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalysts by control of the Sn concentration.

The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does present a scheme for estimating oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, which could potentially be used to screen such alloys for desirable catalytic properties. The scheme incorporates the effects of changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects into the binding energy analysis through a single parameter, the surface d-band center. The agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on a large number of binary alloys is remarkably good, supporting the notion that the d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for a broad range of alloy systems.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the relative chemical reactivity of alloy sites based on their geometric structure and electronic properties. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationship between the alloy's geometric structure and the electronic properties of the d-band, which can be used to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic state of the active metal. The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.

The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of the catalyst. When metals are alloyed, two effects occur simultaneously: charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals, and changes in the hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important for catalysts, it is often unknown which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys work together to influence catalytic performance. Geometric effects refer to the bonding configuration, while electronic effects relate to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface. The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into charge transfer and hybridization effects. Changes in hybridization can manifest in various ways, affecting the d-band center and the adsorption behavior of alloys. Charge transfer can result in the stabilization of d-orbitals and a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level. However, electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength may limit improvements in catalysis. To break from these limitations, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers.

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys play a synergistic role in influencing catalytic performance. Electronic structure calculations can help identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems. The modifications of interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can significantly affect its catalytic activity. Geometric effects should be considered alongside ensemble and ligand effects when discussing the reactivity of bimetallic systems. Bimetallic systems like PtRu exhibit properties beyond those of the pure components, while others like PdCu show intermediate behavior. The electronic and chemical properties of pseudomorphic overlayers are mainly modified by the electronic interaction between the substrate and the overlayers and the strain induced by lattice mismatch. Experimentally, it is challenging to distinguish strain effects from electronic interaction effects. The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center, reducing the CO binding energy. Bimetallic surface alloys offer the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction. Mixing Pt with Ru results in a weaker CO binding, while mixing Ru with Pt causes a stronger CO binding. This mixing enhances the differences in CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites, rather than leading to an intermediate behavior. For CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations. The PdCu interaction in the alloys leads to a weaker CO binding to Pd and a stronger CO interaction with Cu. CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts due to the strong interaction between Cu and Pd. Instead, they form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between the single components. The electronic coupling of Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analyzed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster. The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks, while for the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states are considerably broadened, indicating strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate. The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an intermediate behavior, with d-band orbitals confined within the cluster layer exhibiting a discrete structure, while the other three orbitals with a vertical z-direction component are delocalized. There is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states, but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster.

The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does discuss the electrooxidation of CO and H2/CO mixtures on a well-characterized Pt3Sn electrode surface, which could be relevant to understanding the synergistic effects of alloy composition on catalytic activity.

The reactivity of transition and noble metals is determined by surface properties that influence the ability of metal atoms to form and break bonds. These properties include the surface d-band center, the degree of filling of the d-bands, and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms. The d-band model assumes that variations in coupling between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to variations in the coupling of metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals, which is influenced by the average energy of the d-bands, sensitive to factors such as strain and ligand effects. Understanding the modifications of electronic properties in relation to different electronic and geometric effects is crucial for explaining the reactivity of metal surfaces. This can be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which can determine the role of electronic and geometric effects separately. The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment. Establishing this understanding would enable the calculation of d-band characteristics for any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with a significantly reduced need for DFT calculations. This would provide a new and fast method for screening potential alloy surfaces, potentially including many different surface structures to identify surfaces with desired chemical properties.

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Electronically, when a group 8 metal like nickel, which has an incompletely filled d band, is alloyed with a group 1B metal like copper, which has a filled d band, the d band of the alloy is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the electronic structure and bonding properties of the alloy, potentially affecting its catalytic activity and selectivity. Geometrically, the presence of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface can influence the availability and nature of active sites for catalysis. For instance, if one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive to the inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface. This can lead to selectivity effects, where the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for reactions requiring multiplets of active metal atoms, while having a smaller effect on other reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, where the dispersion of metal atoms can be controlled to optimize the balance between electronic and geometric effects. By varying the composition and dispersion of bimetallic clusters, it may be possible to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The electron-band theory describes group 8 metals like nickel as having an incompletely filled d band, while group 1B metals like copper have a filled d band. When these metals form an alloy, the d band is filled to a greater extent than in the pure group 8 metal. This can alter the catalytic activity by changing the degree of filling of the d band with electrons. However, recent views suggest that there are separate d bands for each component of the alloy, and the surface atoms of different types, such as nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences, although their bonding properties may be altered. The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received attention, with the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal can decrease the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions. Geometric factors at the surface, such as the number of adjacent active metal atoms required for different reactions, can play a crucial role in determining selectivity. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by designing bimetallic catalysts with controlled surface compositions and high dispersions, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure and surface composition of the catalyst. The electronic factor, as described by Mott and Jones, involves the filling of the d band in alloys of group 8 and group 1B metals, which can affect catalytic activity. Geometric factors, such as the arrangement of metal atoms at the surface, can also play a crucial role in determining selectivity, particularly in reactions requiring specific surface sites for different types of reactions. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the development of highly dispersed bimetallic systems, or bimetallic cluster catalysts, which can exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis and have compositions outside the range possible in bulk solid solutions. These catalysts can be prepared by dispersing metals on a carrier, resulting in very small metal clusters with a high surface area, which can lead to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems compared to traditional monometallic catalysts.
