[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
          [2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
          [3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."
          [4] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
          [5] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
          [2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
          [5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
          [6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
          [7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
          [8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
          [9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
          [2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
          [3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
          [4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
          [5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
          [6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
          [7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
          [8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
          [9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
          [10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
          [11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
          [12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
          [13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
          [14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
          [15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
          [16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
          [17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
          [18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
          [19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
          [20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."
          [21] "This demonstrates the strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate."
          [22] "The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an inter- mediate behavior."
          [23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
          [24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
          [26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."



[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."
          [1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

(279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal.

          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction.

[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
          [2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
          [3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."
          [4] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
          [5] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
          [2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
          [5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
          [6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
          [7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
          [8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
          [9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."

          [3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
          [4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
          [5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
          [6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
          [7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
          [8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
          [9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
          [10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
          [11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
          [12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
          [13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
          [14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
          [15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
          [16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
          [17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
          [18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
          [19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
          [20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."

          [23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
          [24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
          [26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."



[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered.

          [4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
          [5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
          [6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
          [7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
          [8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
          [9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
          [10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
          [11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
          [13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."
          [15] "The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high."
          [16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
          [17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."
          [18] "However, the recent increase in publications suggests that this field has also received growing attention."
          [19] "Moreover, the insights obtained from these studies suggest that the potential of intermetallic compounds for catalyst materials is high compared to conventional inorganic catalyst materials."
          [20] "To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials."

[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
          [2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
          [3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."
          [4] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
          [5] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
          [2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
          [5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
          [6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
          [7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
          [8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
          [9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
          [2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
          [3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
          [4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
          [5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
          [6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
          [7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
          [8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
          [9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
          [10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
          [11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
          [12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
          [13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
          [14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
          [15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
          [16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
          [17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
          [18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
          [19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
          [20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."
          [21] "This demonstrates the strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate."
          [22] "The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an inter- mediate behavior."
          [23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
          [24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
          [26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."



[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
          [2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
          [3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."
          [4] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
          [5] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
          [2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
          [5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
          [6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
          [7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
          [8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
          [9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
          [2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
          [3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
          [4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
          [5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
          [6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
          [7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
          [8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
          [9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
          [10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
          [11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
          [12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
          [13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
          [14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
          [15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
          [16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
          [17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
          [18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
          [19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
          [20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."
          [21] "This demonstrates the strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate."
          [22] "The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an inter- mediate behavior."
          [23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
          [24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
          [26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."



[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered.

          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."

          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."

          [16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
          [17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."
          [18] "However, the recent increase in publications suggests that this field has also received growing attention."
          [19] "Moreover, the insights obtained from these studies suggest that the potential of intermetallic compounds for catalyst materials is high compared to conventional inorganic catalyst materials."
          [20] "To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials."
          [1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."
          [1] "A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections."
          [2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
          [3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
          [4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
          [5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
          [6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
          [7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
          [8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
          [9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
          [10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
          [11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
          [13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."

          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."

          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."

[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

(278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."

          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction.

          [1] "A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections."

          [3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
          [4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
          [5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
          [6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
          [7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
          [8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
          [9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
          [10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
          [11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
          [13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."
          [15] "The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high."
          [16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
          [17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."

[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
          [2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
          [3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."
          [4] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
          [5] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
          [2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."
          [5] "Once the perturbation of the d-band due to alloying is known, the adsorption behavior of alloys (to a first approximation) can be described by average d-band filling of the metal atoms in contact with the adsorbate."
          [6] "Charge transfer may result in filling of the d-band for the d-band transition metal, stabilizing the d-orbitals and shifting them to lower energy, resulting in a depletion of d-orbital density near the Fermi level."
          [7] "Although electronic modification of adsorbate binding strength has been demonstrated to affect catalysis positively, a common problem is often evident in that the strengths of all reactants and products are affected in a similar manner, which may limit the degree to which improvements can be made."
          [8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
          [9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

[1] "The reactivity of bimetallic substrates is governed by an interplay of electronic and geometric effects which are hard to disentangle experimentally."
          [2] "It will be shown that electronic structure calculations allow to identify the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems."
          [3] "The modifications of the interatomic distances in a bimetallic system can have a decisive influence on its catalytic activity, as will be shown in this review."
          [4] "Hence this geometric effect should also be con- sidered together with the ensemble and ligand effects when the reactivity of bimetallic systems is discussed."
          [5] "The ligand effect, however, can be well studied in electronic structure calculations."
          [6] "It will be shown that there are bimetallic systems such as PtRu which exhibit properties that do not correspond to an intermediate behavior in between those of the pure components but that are rather beyond those of both components."
          [7] "However, there are other bimetallic systems such as PdCu which act more like a novel metal with properties in between those of the single compo- nents."
          [8] "For pseudomorphic overlayer systems it is experi- mentally usually very hard to disentangle the strain effects from the influence of the electronic interaction between overlayer and substrate."
          [9] "The strong interaction of Ru with Pt leads to a downshift of the local d-band center which together with the compressive strain reduces the CO binding energy on one Pt layer on Ru by more than 0.5 eV compared to pure Pt."
          [10] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
          [11] "The inspection of figure 6 reveals that mixing of Pt by Ru leads to a weaker binding of CO while mixing of Ru by Pt causes a stronger binding of CO."
          [12] "Thus the dif- ference in the CO adsorption energies between Pt and Ru sites increases when Pt and Ru are mixed."
          [13] "This means that the mixing does not lead to an intermediate behavior for both components but rather enhances the differences."
          [14] "For the CO adsorption on CuPd(111) alloys, in fact similar results have been found in electronic structure calculations [10,45]."
          [15] "The PdCu interaction in the alloys does not only lead to a weaker CO binding to Pd, it also causes a stronger CO interaction with Cu."
          [16] "Because of the strong interaction between Cu and Pd, CuPd alloys do not act as bifunctional catalysts."
          [17] "They rather form a relatively homogeneous new metal with intermediate properties between those of the single components."
          [18] "The electronic coupling of the Pd clusters to the metal substrate has been analysed by comparing the orbital resolved d-band local density of states (LDOS) for Pd3 clusters deposited on Au(111) and on Pd(111) and for a free Pd3 cluster."
          [19] "The LDOS of the free cluster consists of isolated discrete peaks corresponding to the localized orbitals of this isolated system."
          [20] "For the Pd3/Pd(111) cluster, all d states in the cluster are con- siderably broadened."
          [21] "This demonstrates the strong coupling between the cluster and the substrate."
          [22] "The supported Pd3/Au(111) cluster shows an inter- mediate behavior."
          [23] "All d-band orbitals that are confined within the cluster layer, i.e., the dxy and the dx2)y2 orbi- tals, exhibit a rather discrete structure."
          [24] "This means that these orbitals are still well localised within the cluster."
          [25] "The LDOS of the other three orbitals that have a component along the vertical z-direction, on the other hand, is rather broad indicating that these states are already delocalized."
          [26] "Thus there is a significant electronic coupling between the Pd and Au states but it is not as strong as the coupling between the Pd states in the cluster and the substrate for the Pd3 cluster."



[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."

          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered.

          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."
          [1] "A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections."
          [2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
          [3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
          [4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
          [5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
          [6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
          [7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
          [8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
          [9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
          [10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
          [11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
          [12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
          [13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
          [14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."
          [15] "The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high."
          [16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
          [17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."
          [18] "However, the recent increase in publications suggests that this field has also received growing attention."
          [19] "Moreover, the insights obtained from these studies suggest that the potential of intermetallic compounds for catalyst materials is high compared to conventional inorganic catalyst materials."
          [20] "To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials."
          [1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."

          [3] "The perturbation of the d-band can be broken down into two terms: a charge transfer effect where the filling of the d-band changes due to a charge transfer event between the metals and a hybridization effect due to the change in the overlap between the orbitals due to the change in nuclear distance and change in orbital extent when one metal is replaced for another."
          [4] "The changes in hybridization can manifest themselves in different ways."

[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
          [2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
          [3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
          [4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
          [5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
          [6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
          [7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band.
According to the original view of Mott and Jones,8 an alloy of a group 8 metal with a group 1B metal is characterized by a d band which is filled to a greater extent than that of the pure group 8 metal.
In the model of electronic structure just described for the alloys, which is known as the rigid band model,there is a single d band for the alloy as a whole, with no differentiation between the different types of atoms in the alloy with regard to their chemical bonding properties.
This model of the electronic structure of group 8-group 1B metal alloys has been challenged in recent yeawg-l2 According to the more recent view,there are separate d bands characteristic of each component of the alloy.
In any case, the experimental data on chemisorption and catalysis indicate that the different types of atoms in the surface of the alloy, e.g.,nickel and copper, retain their chemical differences,although bonding properties of the atoms are probably altered to some degree.
The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention.
Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration.
It has now been shown that the addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases markedly the activity of the latter for the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds in hydrogenolysis reactions of hydrocarbons, but has a much smaller effect on other hydrocarbon reactions such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity.
If one reaction requires a surface site consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms, while another requires a site consisting of only one active metal atom, the former will be more sensitive than the latter to inclusion of inactive foreign metal atoms in the surface.
Fur- thermore, in systems of a group 8 metal and a group 1B metal, the latter may concentrate strongly in the sur- face, so that its influence may be dramatic even at very low concentrations.
In general, the surface composition of a bimetallic catalyst cannot be assumed to be identical with the bulk composition, as recent work in this field has clearly hown.
For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for in- dustrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use.
The resulting catalyst is called a bimetallic cluster rather than an alloy, since systems of interest include metallic combinations which do not form alloys in the bulk.
The dispersion, defined as the fraction of the atoms in a cluster which are present in the surface, depends on the system and conditions of preparation.
In some cases the dispersion approaches unity. The clusters are then extremely small, of the order of 10 A in size, or perhaps possess a two-di- mensional character.
Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst21,22 which has been applied extensively in commercial operations.
The reforming process is important for the production of high an- tiknock quality motor gasolines from petroleum naphtha.,
Evidence that surface and bulk compositions are different in the case of nickel-copper alloys has recently been obtained from hydrogen chemisorption stud- ies,
The addition of only a few percent of copper to nickel decreases the amount of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen severalfold, which suggests that the concentration of copper in the surface is much greater than in the bulk.
The strongly chemisorbed hydrogen refers to the amount which remains on the surface after evacuation at room temperature.
The data in Figure 1 suggest that copper is the predominant component in the surface of nickel-copper alloys containing as little as 5 atom % copper.
If the nickel-copper system is equilibrated at a lower temperature, say 200 C, there is evidence of a miscibility gap.
For com- positions within the gap, the system consists of two phases of constant composition in equilibrium, the relative amounts of the phases depending on the overall composition.
The individual phases do not exist as separate particles, but instead the copper-rich phase forms a surface layer around the nickel-rich phase.
A more extreme example of this type of behavior is the ruthenium-copper system, the components of which are essentially completely immiscible in the bulk.
While the two components are immiscible in the bulk, there is evi- dence of definite interaction between the two at a surface.
Ruthenium-copper samples prepared by precipitation from aqueous solutions of salts of the metals, followed by treatment in hydrogen at elevated temperatures, consist of bimetallic aggregates in which copper tends to cover the surface of the ruthenium.
In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface.
In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations,this component is the group 1B metal.
However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface.
Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold.
Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys be- comes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component.
In addition to selective chemisorption methods, one may employ a variety of other methods to obtain in- formation on the surface compositions of alloys.
These include work function  measurement, Auger spec- t r o s  o p y ,and photoelectron spectrocopy.
All of the methods at present have limitations from the viewpoint of obtaining precise quantitative information on surface composition, but can surely be regarded reliable for yielding qualitative or semiquantitative information.
A striking example of catalytic specificity is provided by recent work on nickel-copper alloy catalysts in which two different reactions were investigated, the hydro- genolysis of ethane to methane and the dehydroge- nation of cyclohexane to benzene:
The effect of adding copper to nickel is markedly different for the two reactions, as shown by the data on specific activities of a series of hickel-copper alloys in Figure 3.
In the case of ethane hydrogenolysis, addition of as little as 5 atom 5% copper to the nickel decreases catalytic activity by three orders of magnitude.
Further addition of copper continues to decrease the activity.
However, for cyclohexane dehydrogenation the initial increments of copper actually increase the catalytic activity of nickel.
As the copper content of the alloy is increased beyond a few percent, the dehydrogenation activity is not affected much over a broad range of composition, exhibiting a marked decline only as the composition approaches pure copper.
In the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metals, it has been concluded that the ethane is chemisorbed with rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds to form a hydrogen-deficient dicarbon surface residue, C2H,, which then undergoes rupture of the carbon-carbon bond to form monocarbon fragments on the  u r f a c e :   -
C,H6 * C,H,(ads) + aH, C,H,(ads) + adsorbed C, fragments
The adsorbed monocarbon fragments are then hy- drogenated to methane.
The symbol ads refers to adsorbed species and the quantity a is equal to (6 - x ) / 2 .  It is visualized that both carbon atoms in the adsorbed intermediate C2H, form bonds with surface metal atoms, and that more than one surface metal atom is involved in the bonding.
In a bimetallic combination of an inactive metal with a highly active metal, we may consider the possibility that the hydrogenolysis activity of the catalyst is de- pendent on the existence of sites comprising multiplets of active metal atoms (i.e., sites consisting of groups of adjacent active metal atoms).
The term multiplet is taken from the work of Balandin.36 The term ensemble has been adopted by  other', in this context.
As the required number of active metal atoms in a multiplet increases, the multiplet concentration becomes more sensitive to dilution of the surface with inactive metal atoms.
If the latter concentrate markedly in the surface, as in the case of nickel-copper alloys, the presence of only a few percent in the alloy may decrease catalytic activity manyfold.
According to this view, the only function of the surface copper atoms in nickel-copper catalysts is to dilute the nickel atoms and thus limit the number of multiplet nickel atom sites.
While such a geometric interpretation is a very reasonable one and can account for a large inhibiting effect of copper on the hydrogenolysis activity of nickel,it is difficult to dismiss the possibility that electronic interaction between copper and nickel atoms may affect the catalysis.
Such an interaction has been called a ligand effect by S a  h t l e r .   ,
In view of the low ability of copper relative to nickel to chemisorb by- drocarbons, the presence of copper could decrease the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbon species.
In ethane hydrogenolysis, the strength of bonding between the two carbon atoms in the chemisorbed intermediate might be expected to vary in an inverse manner with the strength of bonding of the carbon atoms to the metal.
One would then conclude that rupture of the carbon-carbon bond would be inhibited by a decrease in the strength of adsorption accompanying addition of copper to nickel.
If carbon-carbon rupture is rate limiting, the rate of hydrogenolysis should then de- crease.
The markedly different effect of copper on the catalytic activity of nickel for cyclohexane dehydro- genation, as compared to ethane hydrogenolysis, is rationalized as follows.
There is the possibility that the reaction does not require a site consisting of a multiplet of active nickel atoms, and is therefore much less sensitive to the presence of copper atoms in the surface than a reaction requiring such multiplets,
While this possibility can account for the absence of a sharp de- cline in activity as copper is added to nickel, it does not explain why copper-rich alloys have dehydrogenation activities as high as or higher than that of pure nickel.
If addition of copper to nickel decreases the strength of adsorption of hydrocarbons, and the rate-determining step is desorption of the benzene product, the activity of a catalytic site would increase and compensate for a decrease in the number of such sites.
However, it is not necessary that desorption of the product be rate limiting.
It is required only that the rate-determining step be one which is adversely affected by an increase in the strength of adsorption.
The range of composition over which the rate is essentially constant may be
A supported bimetallic catalyst can be prepared simply by wetting a suitable carrier such as silica with an aqueous solution of salts of the two metals of in- terest.
The material is then dried and contacted with a stream of hydrogen at a temperature high enough to accomplish reduction of the metal precursors to the metallic state.
This procedure results in the formation of very small metal clusters dispersed on the surface of the carrier.
The nature of these metallic entities is the question of interest.
Will the individual clusters be monometallic or will there be mixing of atoms of the different metals in the form of bimetallic clusters?
One might expect on purely statistical grounds that the individual clusters would contain atoms of both metals.
This expectation is supported by experiment, even for cases in which the individual metal components exhibit very low miscibility in the blk.l,O
Examples of in- teresting systems involving components of extremely limited miscibility are ruthenium-copper and osmi- um-copper supported on silica.
Catalysts containing 1 wt % of either ruthenium or osmium and varying amounts of copper have been investigated.
The at- tomic ratio of copper to the group 8 metal ranged from
0 to 1.
The degree of metal dispersion was high in all of these catalysts, as evidenced by the fact that x-ray diffraction scans showed no lines due to the metals.
By contrast, a sample containing 1 wt % copper alone on silica gave diffraction lines characteristic of metallic copper with a crystallite size of 200 A.
The absence of lines due to copper in the case of the ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper catalysts indicates that the ru- thenium and osmium interact with the copper, with the result that large copper crystallites are not formed.
The observations are consistent with the existence of ru- thenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters on the surface of the carrier.
Direct experimental verification of the bimetallic cluster concept is complicated by limitations in the ability of physical methods to obtain structural in- formation on highly dispersed systems.
In such a system, however, a catalytic reaction can serve as a sensitive probe to obtain evidence of interaction be- tween the atoms of the two metallic components.
For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose.
In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present.
Data on hydrogenolysis activities of the rutheni- um-copper and osmium-copper catalysts described in the previous paragraphs are shown in Figure 6.
A measure of the number of surface sites in each catalyst is provided by data on the chemisorption of hydrogen at room temperature, each surface site corresponding to one atom of adsorbed hydrogen.
This makes it possible to determine specific activity, i.e., the catalytic activity per surface site.
Such a definition of specific activity is useful for normalizing the catalytic activity data, but should not be interpreted to mean that a hydrocarbon molecule undergoing reaction requires only
The data of Figure 6 provide strong evidence of interaction between copper and the group 8 metal, and thus support the bimetallic cluster concept.
Since incorporation of copper with the group 8 metal decreases the hydrogenolysis activity markedly, the metal components are clearly not isolated from each other on the carrier.
It is of interest to consider how the state of dispersion of ruthenium-copper catalysts affects the relationship between ethane hydrogenolysis activity and catalyst composition.
A comparison of large ruthenium- copper aggregates with highly dispersed ruthenium- copper clusters is given in Figure 7.
The dispersion,defined as the percentage of metal atoms present in the surface, is of the order of 1% for the large rutheni- um-copper aggregates and of the order of 50% for the ruthenium-copper clusters.
The presence of one atom of copper per atom of ruthenium decreases the hy- drogenolysis activity of ruthenium by 1000-fold in the case of the highly dispersed clusters.
The same in- hibiting effect of the copper is found with the large ruthenium-copper aggregates when the amount of copper is only 1-2% of the amount of ruthenium in the catalyst.
A similar conclusion is reached when hydrogen chemisorption data on these systems are compared.
Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect.
The required ratios differ by a factor approximately equal to the ratio of the metal dispersions of the catalysts.
This indicates that the copper in a ruthenium-copper aggregate is confined to the surface, which is consistent with the extremely low miscibility of the two metals in the bulk state.
If one envisions a series of ruthenium-copper aggregates of varying size, each comprising a monolayer of copper on a ruthenium core, the atomic ratio of copper to ruthenium in an aggregate will increase with decreasing aggregate size.
From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals.
As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis.l
However, they are not the only types of bimetallic clusters of interest.
Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium.
Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties.
However, in the case of plati- tum-iridium catalysts, x-ray diffraction has proved to be very useful in providing direct evidence for the existence of platinum-iridium clusters in the approx- imate size range of 25-50 A.
As already pointed out,it becomes increasingly difficult to characterize such systems by conventional physical methods as the degree of metal dispersion increases.
In recent years, there have been advances in the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy which hold much promise for this purpose.
It has been shown that analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) can yield structural information on highly dispersed, noncrystalline ma- t e r i a l  .
The application of EXAFS to bimetallic catalysts is currently being investigated by the author and his  collaborator.





[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
          [2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
          [3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
          [4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
          [5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
          [6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
          [7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
          [8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
          [10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
          [11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
          [12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
          [13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
          [14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
          [15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
          [16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
          [17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
          [18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
          [19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
          [20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
          [21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
          [22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
          [2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
          [4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
          [5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
          [6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

          [4] "In summary, we showed two examples of novel steric effects governed by specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds. These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform. Although only a few examples have been discovered as of yet, future investigations will bring similar observations and open up a new horizon for this area of chemistry."
          [5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

(279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."

          [4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction.
