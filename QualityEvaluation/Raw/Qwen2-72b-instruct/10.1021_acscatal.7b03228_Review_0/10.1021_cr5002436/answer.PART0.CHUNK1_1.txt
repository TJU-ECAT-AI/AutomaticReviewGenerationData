1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can reduce the heat of adsorption and increase the stability of the catalyst by weakening the binding of hydrocarbons to the metal, facilitating the migration of coke precursors from the metal to the support. This suggests that alloying can have significant effects on catalytic performance. Further research is needed to fully understand and exploit the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic properties in transition-metal alloys for catalysis.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金的几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有讨论利用这种相互作用设计比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性、更可调的催化系统的创新策略。但是，它确实提到在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn可以降低吸附热，并通过削弱烃类与金属的结合，促进焦炭前体从金属向载体的迁移，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。这表明合金化可以对催化性能产生重大影响。需要进一步的研究来充分理解和利用过渡金属合金的几何和电子性质在催化中的协同效应。
