1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of promoters, such as tin, to platinum-based catalysts can modify the catalytic properties of platinum, affecting both the geometric and electronic properties of the active sites. For example, tin can reduce the size of platinum nanoparticles, which can suppress side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Additionally, alloyed metallic tin or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum can transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, altering the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. These effects can lead to increased selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有讨论利用这种相互作用设计比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性和更可调的催化系统的创新策略。但是，它确实提到向铂基催化剂添加促进剂，如锡，可以改变铂的催化性质，影响活性位点的几何和电子性质。例如，锡可以减小铂纳米粒子的尺寸，这可以抑制氢解和异构化等副反应。此外，与铂紧密接触的合金化金属锡或Sn2+物种可以向铂原子的5d带转移电子，改变金属的吸附和催化性质。这些效应可以导致催化剂的选择性和稳定性增加。
