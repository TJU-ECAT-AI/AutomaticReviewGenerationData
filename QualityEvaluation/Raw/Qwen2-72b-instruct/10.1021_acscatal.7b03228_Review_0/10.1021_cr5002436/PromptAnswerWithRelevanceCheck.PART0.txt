1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can reduce the heat of adsorption and the amount of highly active Pt step sites, which may affect the catalytic performance. It also notes that the presence of Sn can facilitate the migration of hydrocarbons from the metal to the support, which can reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability. These effects may be related to geometric and electronic changes in the PtSn alloy. Further research is needed to fully understand and exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for catalytic applications.

However, it does mention that the addition of promoters like tin to platinum-based catalysts can modify the catalytic properties of platinum, affecting both the geometric and electronic properties. For example, tin can reduce the size of platinum nanoparticles, which suppresses side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. Tin can also transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, altering the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. These effects can increase selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

1.The literature does not provide specific quotes about how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of tin to platinum-based catalysts can modify both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support. The reducibility of SnO2 depends largely on the interaction with the support, strong interaction making the reduction more difficult. However, Pt in close proximity assists with the reduction of Sn. The formation of a platinum-tin alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles. Tin selectively covers low coordination platinum sites (such as steps, corners, edges, and defects), which are believed to be responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction. The sintering of Pt nanoparticles is retarded with the addition of Sn. Coke precursors prefer to adsorb on large Pt ensembles, and thus the addition of Sn facilitates the migration of these precursors from the PtSn surface to the support, effectively reducing the detrimental effects of coke deposition. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. The interaction of promoters with platinum can be assessed by measuring the heat of adsorption of distinct probe molecules through microcalorimetric methods. DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface.

1.The literature does not provide specific quotes that directly address how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, or what innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, the literature does discuss the role of geometric and electronic effects in the context of PtSn-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. This phenomenon is explained by DFT calculations that show an increase in the electron density of platinum when tin is incorporated into silica and γ-alumina-supported catalysts. The addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, suggesting that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface. These effects result in an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

1.文献没有提供直接说明过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能，或可以开发什么创新策略来利用这种相互作用设计出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性、更可调的催化系统的具体引文。但是，文献确实讨论了PtSn基催化剂中几何和电子效应在脱氢反应中的作用。在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn会同时改变铂活性相和载体，抑制氢解和异构化反应，最小化金属烧结，中和载体的酸性，并促进焦炭物种从金属表面向载体的扩散。形成PtSn合金和/或部分覆盖铂颗粒的锡物种会导致形成较小的铂集合体，可以抑制结构敏感反应，如焦化。Sn对Pt的电子改性被认为在抑制焦炭形成中起着重要作用，通过增加铂的电子密度，削弱与锡紧密接触的铂原子上乙基化物的吸附。这种现象通过DFT计算得到解释，计算显示当锡被掺入到二氧化硅和γ-氧化铝支撑的催化剂中时，铂的电子密度增加。添加Sn还降低了PtSn(111)表面上氢的吸附热，表明与Pt(111)表面相比，氢原子在后者的扩散更容易。这些效应导致Pt和Sn的最佳比例，建议为Pt3Sn。Sn添加的几何和电子效应之间的平衡导致具有高活性和选择性的脱氢反应的催化剂。

However, it does mention that the addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can reduce the heat of adsorption and the amount of highly active Pt step sites, on which reaction intermediates adsorb strongly. This suggests that alloying can influence the electronic structure of the catalyst and thereby its performance. The literature also discusses the use of DFT calculations to study the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on a series of clusters containing a single Cr3+ ion bonded to OH or OSi groups species, which served as a model for the different active sites suggested in literature. This indicates that electronic effects can play a role in determining catalytic activity. Overall, while the literature does not directly address the question, it does provide some insights into how geometric and electronic effects can influence catalytic performance.
