1.The literature does not provide specific quotes related to how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, the literature does discuss the role of promoters like tin in modifying the catalytic properties of platinum, which can be seen as an example of exploiting the interplay between geometric and electronic effects. Tin addition to platinum catalysts can reduce the size of platinum nanoparticles, which is a geometric effect that can suppress side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization. At the same time, tin can also modify the electronic properties of platinum by transferring electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which can alter the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. This dual effect of tin on the geometric and electronic properties of platinum can lead to improved catalytic performance in terms of both activity and selectivity.

1.文献没有提供关于过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体引用，也没有讨论利用这种相互作用设计更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统以超越传统单金属催化剂的创新策略。然而，文献确实讨论了像锡这样的促进剂在修改铂的催化性质中的作用，这可以看作是利用几何和电子效应相互作用的一个例子。向铂催化剂中添加锡可以减小铂纳米粒子的尺寸，这是一种几何效应，可以抑制氢解和异构化等副反应。同时，锡也可以通过向铂原子的5d带转移电子来改变铂的电子性质，这可以改变金属的吸附和催化性质。锡对铂的几何和电子性质的双重影响可以导致催化性能在活性和选择性方面得到改善。
