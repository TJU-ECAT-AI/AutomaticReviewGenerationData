          The literature discusses the role of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly in PtSn-based catalysts, for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts modifies both the platinum active phase and the support, suppressing hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizing metal sintering, neutralizing the acidity of the support, and facilitating the diffusion of coke species from the metal surface to the support. The formation of a PtSn alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles, which can curb structure-sensitive reactions such as coking. The electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play an important role in inhibiting coke formation by increasing the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. These effects can lead to an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which is suggested to be Pt3Sn. The balance between the geometric and electronic effects of Sn addition results in a catalyst with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to exploit this interplay could include the use of high-throughput screening methods to identify optimal alloy compositions, the use of theoretical calculations to predict the effects of alloying on catalytic performance, and the development of new synthesis methods to precisely control the composition and structure of alloy catalysts.

          文献讨论了过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的作用，特别是在PtSn基催化剂中，用于脱氢反应。在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn会同时改变铂活性相和载体，抑制氢解和异构化反应，最小化金属烧结，中和载体的酸性，并促进焦炭物种从金属表面向载体的扩散。形成PtSn合金和/或部分覆盖铂颗粒的锡物种会导致形成较小的铂集合体，可以抑制结构敏感反应，如焦化。Sn对Pt的电子改性被认为在抑制焦炭形成中起着重要作用，通过增加铂的电子密度，削弱与锡紧密接触的铂原子上乙基化物的吸附。这些效应可以导致Pt和Sn的最佳比例，建议为Pt3Sn。Sn添加的几何和电子效应之间的平衡导致具有高活性和选择性的脱氢反应的催化剂。利用这种相互作用的策略可能包括使用高通量筛选方法来确定最佳合金组成，使用理论计算来预测合金化对催化性能的影响，以及开发新的合成方法来精确控制合金催化剂的组成和结构。
