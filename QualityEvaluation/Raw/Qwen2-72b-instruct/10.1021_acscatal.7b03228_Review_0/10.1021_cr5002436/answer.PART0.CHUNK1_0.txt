1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can reduce the heat of adsorption and the amount of highly active Pt step sites, which may affect the catalytic performance. It also notes that the presence of Sn can facilitate the migration of hydrocarbons from the metal to the support, which can reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability. These effects may be related to geometric and electronic changes in the PtSn alloy. Further research is needed to fully understand and exploit the interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for catalytic applications.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有讨论利用这种相互作用设计比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性、更可调的催化系统的创新策略。但是，它确实提到在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn可以降低吸附热和高活性Pt台阶位点的数量，这可能会影响催化性能。它还指出，Sn的存在可以促进烃类从金属向载体的迁移，这可以减少焦炭形成，提高催化剂稳定性。这些效应可能与PtSn合金中的几何和电子变化有关。需要进一步的研究来充分理解和利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的相互作用，用于催化应用。
