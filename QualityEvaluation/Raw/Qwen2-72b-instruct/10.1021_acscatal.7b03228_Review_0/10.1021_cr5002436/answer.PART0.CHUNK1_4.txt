1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it discuss innovative strategies to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. However, it does mention that the addition of Sn to Pt-based catalysts can reduce the heat of adsorption and the amount of highly active Pt step sites, on which reaction intermediates adsorb strongly. This suggests that alloying can influence the electronic structure of the catalyst and thereby its performance. The literature also discusses the use of DFT calculations to study the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on a series of clusters containing a single Cr3+ ion bonded to OH or OSi groups species, which served as a model for the different active sites suggested in literature. This indicates that electronic effects can play a role in determining catalytic activity. Overall, while the literature does not directly address the question, it does provide some insights into how geometric and electronic effects can influence catalytic performance.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金的几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有讨论利用这种相互作用设计比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统的创新策略。但是，它确实提到在Pt基催化剂中添加Sn可以降低吸附热，并减少反应中间体强烈吸附的高活性Pt台阶位点的数量。这表明合金化可以影响催化剂的电子结构，从而影响其性能。文献还讨论了使用DFT计算研究一系列包含单个Cr3+离子与OH或OSi基团结合的簇在乙烷脱氢反应中的机制，这些簇作为文献中提出的不同活性位点的模型。这表明电子效应可以影响催化活性的确定。总的来说，虽然文献没有直接回答这个问题，但它确实提供了一些关于几何和电子效应如何影响催化性能的见解。
