[1] "The reactivity of the transition and noble metals (Cu, Ag and Au) is determined by the surface properties that determine the ability of metal atoms to make and break bonds [2]. Those surface properties include the surface d-band centre (1d),the degree of filling of the d-bands ( fd) and the coupling matrix elements between the adsorbate and the surface metal atoms [3]."
[2] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals. The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
[3] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
[4] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
[5] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
[6] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
[7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."

1.过渡金属和贵金属的反应性由决定金属原子形成和断裂键能力的表面性质决定。这些性质包括表面d带中心、d带的填充程度以及吸附物和表面金属原子之间的耦合矩阵元素。d带模型假设金属d态和吸附物轨道之间的耦合变化在很大程度上决定了吸附物和表面金属原子之间的差异。耦合变化是由于d带平均能量的差异造成的，这与应变和配位效应等因素有关。理解不同电子和几何效应下电子性质的修改对于解释金属表面的反应性至关重要。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算可以作为计算机实验，以分别确定电子和几何效应的作用。通过过渡金属表面d带宽度与描述原子与其环境之间键合相互作用的原子间矩阵元素之间的相关性，可以估计d带特性的修改。如果建立了这种理解，那么就可以在大幅减少DFT计算需求的情况下计算任何表面的d带特性，包括结构、合金化等效应。这将提供一种新的快速筛选潜在合金表面的方法，可以扩展到包括许多不同的表面结构，以识别具有所需化学性质的表面。
