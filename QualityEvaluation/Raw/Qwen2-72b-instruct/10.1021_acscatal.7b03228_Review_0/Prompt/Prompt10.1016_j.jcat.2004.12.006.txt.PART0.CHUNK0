1. Introduction
The development of heterogeneous catalysts to selec- tively remove butadiene in C4 alkene streams produced by steam cracking is of considerable interest. The ideal cat- alyst and process would convert butadiene selectively to butene but not lead to further hydrogenation of butene to butane. Various platinum surfaces, including supported cat- alysts [16] and single crystals [4,712], have been inves- tigated regarding the hydrogenation of butadiene. Unfortu- nately, mixtures of butene isomers and butane apparently are usually produced over platinum catalysts.
Supported PtSn bimetallic catalysts have been reported to be effective in the selective hydrogenation of diolefin im- purities [13]. Generally, adding Sn to Pt catalysts used for * Corresponding author.

Koel). hydrocarbon conversion reactions results in decreased cat- alytic activity, increased selectivity for unsaturated hydro- carbon products, and reduced coking, which prolongs the lifetime of the catalyst. Specifically, several reports show that the presence of Sn in bimetallic Pt catalysts prevents alkene hydrogenation, which is important to the selective removal of diene impurities. Adding Sn to a supported Pt catalyst caused a dramatic decrease in catalytic activ- ity for propene hydrogenation [14]. In addition, hydrogena- tion activity for ethylene and 1-hexene was inhibited on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts [15]. Although the reactivity of a Pt(111) single crystal increased slightly for ethylene hydro- genation when 0.1-ML Sn was added, it decreases quickly with further increase in the Sn coverage [16].

25 acts as an inhibitor to alkene hydrogenation. Other recent ex- periments have shown that chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene com- pletely decomposes on both clean and H-precovered Pt(111) surfaces during TPD, with no hydrogenation reaction ob- served [18]. This presumably is due to the very strong bond- ing interactions between 1,3-butadiene and Pt(111). Previ- ously we have shown in 1,3-butadiene chemisorption studies that alloying Sn with Pt(111) decreases this interaction, and the decomposition pathway is totally blocked on the (2 × 2) and (

3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys [19]. It is natural to inquire whether this reduced interaction between 1,3-butadiene and the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys may lead to hydrogenation reactions in the presence of coadsorbed hy- drogen.
In this paper we report on studies using temperature- programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorption and reaction of 1,3-butadiene on hydrogen-precovered (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (

2. Experimental
Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV cham- ber as described earlier [20]. The Pt(111) crystal (Atomer- gic; 10-mm diameter, 1.5 mm thick) was prepared by 1-keV Ar+ ion sputtering and oxygen exposures (5×107 Torr O2,at 900 K for 2 min) to give a clean spectrum with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a sharp (1×1) pattern with low-energy electron diffraction (LEED).We prepared the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (
3 ×
3)R30-
Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys by evaporating one monolayer of Sn onto the Pt(111) crystal surface and subsequently anneal- ing the sample for 20 s to 1000 and 830 K, respectively. Sn is substitutionally incorporated primarily into the surface layer to form an ordered alloy or intermetallic compound with θSn = 0.25, with a composition and structure correspond- ing to the (111) face of a bulk Pt3Sn crystal, and for the latter situation, θSn = 0.33, with a composition correspond- ing to a Pt2Sn surface. These surface alloys are relatively flat, but Sn atoms protrude 0.02 nm above the surface Pt plane at both surfaces [21]. In the (2 × 2) alloy, pure Pt three-fold sites are present, but no adjacent pure Pt three- fold sites exist. All pure Pt three-fold sites are eliminated on the (
3×
3)R30alloy, and only two-fold pure Pt sites are present. For brevity throughout this paper, we will refer to the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) and (
3 ×
3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) sur- face alloys as the (2 × 2) and
3 alloys, respectively.
A Pt-tube doser was constructed, based on the design of Engel and Rieder [22], as a pyrolytic source of hy- drogen atoms. The principal component is a bent Pt tube (1-mm o.d., 0.8-mm i.d.) into which a 0.1-mm-diameter hole was mechanically drilled. The tube was resistively heated to 1275 C, and water cooling kept the adjacent Cu block cold. The temperature of the Pt tube was directly measured with an optical pyrometer that was calibrated by the tem- perature of the Pt(111) crystal sample, as measured with a Cr/Al thermocouple. The estimated relative accuracy of the pyrometer reading was 5 C. The flux of H atoms obtained from this source operating at 800 C with a back- ground pressure rise in the chamber of 5 × 108 Torr was 3 × 1013 atomscm2 s1. We obtained this value by assum- ing that the initial sticking coefficient of H atoms on Pt(111) at 100 K was unity and using a calibration for the H cover- age, θH, that was given by the hydrogen yield in TPD from the well-known decomposition of ethylene on Pt(111) [23].
H2 (Matheson; 99.99%) was introduced via a variable leak valve (GranvillePhillips) into the Pt-tube doser. 1,3- Butadiene, C4H6 (Matheson; 99.5%), was used without ad- ditional purification. 1,3-Butadiene was exposed on the alloy surface by a microcapillary array doser connected to the gas line through a variable leak valve. All of the exposures re- ported here are given simply in terms of the background pressure in the UHV chamber as measured by an ion gauge.
No attempt was made to correct for the flux enhancement of the doser or ion gauge sensitivity. The mass spectrometer in the chamber was used to check the purity of the gases during dosing.
For all TPD experiments, the heating rate was 3.6 K/s,and all exposures were made with the surface temperature at 100 K. AES measurements were made with a double- pass cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) and a modulation voltage of 4 eV. The electron gun was operated at 3-keV beam energy and 1.5-A beam current. Coverages (θi) re- ported in this paper are referenced to the surface atom density of Pt(111) such that θPt = 1.0 ML is defined as
1.505 × 1015 cm2.
3. Results
Hydrogen adatoms were preadsorbed on the (2 × 2) al- loy, and then adsorption and reaction of a monolayer of 1,3-butadiene (C4H6) on this surface at 100 K were inves- tigated by TPD. An exposure of 0.24-L 1,3-butadiene was used, which produces a coverage of about two monolay- ers on the two clean alloy surfaces. Desorption spectra for 1,3-butadiene, C4H6 (54 amu); butene, C4H8 (56 amu); and H2 (2 amu) obtained in these experiments are shown in Figs. 13, respectively. Several other masses, including bu- tane, C4H10 (58 amu), were also monitored during heating in TPD, but no significant signals were detected in the TPD spectra.
Fig. 1 shows the thermal desorption of molecular 1,3- butadiene from the clean (bottom curve) and H-precovered (2 × 2) alloy surfaces. Desorption from the chemisorbed monolayer on the clean (2 × 2) alloy produces a wide peak centered at 334 K, which is consistent with our previous study [19]. There, we made an estimate of the desorption activation energy Ed of 88 kJ/mol by using the Redhead 26

Preadsorbed H adatoms reduce the amount of 1,3-buta- diene desorption in this peak, and this peak disappears after preadsorption of 0.476-ML H. Desorption of the most strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene is affected first by preadsorbed H. This is shown by the shift of the 1,3-butadiene desorption peak to a lower temperature and the appearance of a peak at 283 K (Ed = 73 kJ/mol) in the TPD spectra taken for 0.159-ML H.
The inset shows the low-temperature region of the des- orption traces in Fig. 1 on an expanded scale. As shown in the inset, the desorption peak of physisorbed (second-layer) 1,3-butadiene shifts from 130 K on the clean (2 × 2) al- loy to 140 K on the 0.476-ML H surface. Some clustering apparently occurs on the H-precovered surfaces, and low- temperature desorption onset characteristic of the multilayer appears near 105 K. One can calculate values of Ed of 33 and 35 kJ/mol for 1,3-butadiene adsorbed in the second layer on the clean and 0.476-ML H precovered (2 × 2) alloy, respec- tively.
Desorption of butene, C4H8, is shown in Fig. 2. This is a hydrogenation product produced by surface reactions. 1,3-Butadiene adsorption on the clean (2 × 2) alloy leads to a small amount of desorption (bottom curve) in a peak at 376 K. Because there is no coadsorption possible from H2 in the background gas (i.e., H2 does not dissociatively chemisorb on the (2 × 2) alloy under UHV conditions [25]),this must originate from hydrogenation reactions utilizing Fig. 2. Butene, C4H8 TPD spectra after after 0.24-L 1,3-Butadiene expo- sures on the clean and H-precovered (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) alloy at 100 K. hydrogen liberated by 1,3-butadiene dehydrogenation. The amount of butene desorption is initially increased by H preadsorption and then decreased by the largest H pre- coverages. The decreased hydrogenation yield at high val- ues of θH is due at least partially to the low coverage of 1,3-butadiene that results from the site-blocking effects of preadsorbed H. The butene desorption peak shifts down to 354 K (Ed = 91 kJ/mol) for 0.16-ML H and then to 345 K (Ed = 89 kJ/mol) for θH = 0.32 and 0.48 ML.
Because butene desorption is reaction-rate limited, as dis- cussed below, this shift arises from faster reaction kinetics at higher θH.
Fig. 2 shows that some butene is produced below 200 K.
The butene TPD peaks near 130 and 145 K have shapes sim- ilar to those of the low-temperature 1,3-butadiene desorption traces shown in the inset to Fig. 1, and thus these are TPD artifacts in the butene spectra. However, for θH = 0.32 and
0.48 ML, the butene peak area at 145 K (Ed = 36 kJ/mol)
increases significantly (and even a new peak arises at 170 K),whereas those for 1,3-butadiene do not, and so butene is in- deed produced under these conditions. At these hydrogen precoverages, desorption of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene near 300 K was nearly eliminated. This indicates that the low- temperature butene yield was due to facile hydrogenation of weakly adsorbed, π-bonded species.
Desorption of H2 associated with these experiments is shown in Fig. 3. The bottom curve shows the H2 yield from 1,3-butadiene dehydrogenation and decomposition on the

This is consistent with previous stud- ies [19] that showed only a small amount of dehydrogenation occurred. In such cases, it is difficult to distinguish between a small reactivity for the alloy and a small number of reac- tive defect sites. H preadsorption results in a new or larger H2 desorption peak at 347 K (Ed = 90 kJ/mol) and a sharp- ening of the peak at 425 K (Ed = 111 kJ/mol). Increas- ing preadsorbed θH to 0.48 ML shifts the primary peak to a slightly lower temperature of 338 K and results in two new desorption peaks at 214 and 254 K. A comparison of these H2 TPD spectra in Fig. 3 with those obtained after the same hydrogen exposure on the (2 × 2) alloy without 1,3-butadiene post-adsorption [26] establishes that the peaks at 214, 254, and 338347 K in Fig. 3 are from desorption of preadsorbed H, and, furthermore, no shifts of these peaks were observed due to coadsorbed 1,3-butadiene. The peak at 425 K is similar to that observed in TPD for the decompo- sition of 1-butene and 2-butene at low coverages and 11 K higher than that from the full monolayers, on the (2 × 2) al- loy [27]. Consistent with this H2 desorption yield at 425 K,surface carbon was detected by AES after TPD experiments on the H precovered (2 × 2) alloy.
TPD experiments were also carried out after 0.24-L ex- posures of 1,3-butadiene on the clean and H-precovered
3 alloy at 100 K. Only 1,3-butadiene, C4H6 (54 amu); butene, C4H8 (56 amu); and H2 (2 amu) were detected in TPD; these curves are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the influence of preadsorbed H on the desorption of molecular 1,3-butadiene from the
3 alloy.
Chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene desorbs in a relatively narrow peak at 285 K (bottom curve) from the clean
3 alloy.
This peak decreases in intensity with increasing H pread- sorption and shifts up slightly to 307 K (Ed = 79 kJ/mol) on the
3 alloy with θH = 0.31 ML. In addition, two new,weak desorption features arise at 177 and 361 K on the H precovered surfaces. Whereas the peak at 177 K (Ed = 45 kJ/mol) is probably from desorption of a weakly bound state of 1,3-butadiene in the monolayer, the peak at 361 K (Ed = 93 kJ/mol) is suggested to be from the dehydrogena- tion of some surface intermediate formed by hydrogenation reactions at lower temperatures. The intensity decrease with increasing θH occurs primarily from site-blocking effects of preadsorbed hydrogen on 1,3-butadiene chemisorption.
The inset in Fig. 4 highlights the H-induced changes in the desorption of physisorbed 1,3-butadiene. Desorption from the physisorbed, second layer shifts from 121 K on the clean
3 alloy to 134 K on the surface with θH = 0.31 ML.
This corresponds to a small increase in the desorption acti- vation energy from 30 to 34 kJ/mol.
Fig. 5 shows butene TPD spectra that result from 1,3- butadiene hydrogenation reactions. On the clean
3 alloy,no butene desorption occurred. No coadsorbed hydrogen is possible from H2 adsorption from the background [25], and 28

3 al- loy are thought to be TPD artifacts in the butene spectra, as discussed above. Preadsorbed H immediately leads to butene production and desorption, and two broad butene TPD peaks were observed at 282 and 348 K from the surface with θH = 0.13 ML. The onset for butene desorption appears to be as low as 170 K (Ed = 43 kJ/mol). The peak at 282 K (Ed = 72 kJ/mol) shifts upward to 295 K (Ed = 76 kJ/mol) with increasing θH, but no large change occurs in the peak at 348 K (Ed = 90 kJ/mol). As occurred on the (2 × 2) alloy,for θH 0.23, butene is produced and desorbs near 134 K (Ed = 34 kJ/mol) because of facile hydrogenation of weakly adsorbed, π-bonded species. Increasing the H precoverage to 0.31 ML results in a new butene desorption peak at 183 K (Ed = 46 kJ/mol).
H2 TPD spectra generated simultaneously in these experi- ments are shown in Fig. 6. The bottom trace of Fig. 6 was ob- tained after 1,3-butadiene adsorption on the clean
3 alloy.
The result that there was no significant H2 desorption is con- sistent with our previous study showing that 1,3-butadiene did not decompose on the
3 alloy during TPD [19]. There is a peak at 272 K (Ed = 70 kJ/mol) at θH = 0.13, which shifts to 260 K (Ed = 67 kJ/mol) at θH = 0.31 ML, and a peak at 217 K (Ed = 55 kJ/mol) for θH = 0.31 ML. Signals below 200 K are derived from butadiene desorption and do not reflect H2 desorption. The observation that no new H2 TPD peaks arose and the close resemblance of the H2 TPD peaks in Fig. 6 with those peaks obtained after the same H Fig. 6. H2 TPD spectra after 0.24-L 1,3-butadiene exposures on the clean and H-precovered (
3 ×
3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy at 100 K. atom exposures without any subsequent 1,3-butadiene ad- sorption indicate that no 1,3-butadiene dehydrogenation or decomposition occurs under these conditions. AES measure- ments after each TPD experiment detect no surface carbon and thus give a consistent picture. Furthermore, coadsorbed 1,3-butadiene had no significant effect on the H2 TPD spec- tra from H atom exposure.
In these experiments, we were unable to identify the na- ture of the butene molecules, that is, as 1-butene, cis- or trans-2-butene, or isobutene, that were desorbed as shown in Figs. 2 and 5. Previously, we studied the adsorption of 1- butene, cis-2-butene, and isobutene on Pt(111) and these two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys [27]. We note that the conversion of the C4H8 TPD peak areas in Figs. 2 and 5 to the amount or coverage of desorbed butene is complicated by the fact that we cannot identify the butene isomers in TPD experi- ments. In general, this is a simple conversion determined by comparing the unknown TPD peak area to that from a cal- ibrated yield of one of the butenes from Pt(111). However,if we do the conversion assuming that 1-butene is the des- orbed product, and thus comparing directly with the yield of chemisorbed 1-butene from the 1-butene monolayer on Pt(111), we obtain about twice the yield that we would cal- culate by using 2-butene as the calibration. We obtained the butene yields reported below in Figs. 7 and 8 using 1-butene as the calibration.
Fig. 7 summarizes and quantifies the influence of pread- sorbed H adatoms on the yields of products measured in the TPD data from the (2 × 2) alloy. We plot in Fig. 7, as a function of the H precoverage θH on the (2 × 2) alloy, the

Influence of H-adatom precoverage on the amount of 1,3-butadiene adsorption, desorption, and hydrogenation on the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) alloy. amount of reversibly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene (θC4H6), the amount of butene desorbed after formation by hydrogenation (θC4H8), and the total amount of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene (θC4H6+C4H8). The conversion (θC4H8/θC4H6+C4H8) is also plotted on the right-hand axis.
The total coverage of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene (θC4H6+C4H8) is decreased, roughly linearly, by preadsorbed H, and we find that 1,3-butadiene chemisorption is elim- inated when θH reaches 0.49 ML. This is a significant site-blocking influence exerted by H adatoms because 1,3- butadiene is potentially a strongly chemisorbed species. The other main effect that is observed is that the yield of butene from hydrogenation reactions increases strongly. The θC4H8 curve increases from near zero on the clean alloy to a broad maximum near θH = 0.25 ML. The decrease observed at larger θH values could easily be due simply to the decrease in the initial amount of 1,3-butadiene available for reaction.
Of course, the amount of reversibly adsorbed 1,3-butadiene θC4H6 decreases quickly with increasing θH because of the combined effects of increased site blocking and the propen- sity for hydrogenation reactions.
The conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene increases al- most linearly with increasing θH and reaches a value of
1.0 at θH = 0.47 ML. But this hydrogenation is in com-
petition with other processes on the surface during heat- ing in TPD. Two H atoms are needed to hydrogenate one 1,3-butadiene molecule to produce one butene molecule. Al- though 1,3-butadiene is in surplus on the (2 × 2) alloy at small θH, some H atom recombination occurs to desorb H2,and this competes with hydrogenation. On the (2 × 2) alloy with large θH, some 1,3-butadiene desorbs without being hy- drogenated, even though H adatoms are oversupplied, and this competes with hydrogenation.
The influence of preadsorbed H on adsorption and hydro- genation of 1,3-butadiene on the
3 alloy is shown in Fig. 8.
The site-blocking effects of preadsorbed H initially decrease Fig. 8. Influence of H-adatom precoverage on the amount of 1,3-butadi- ene adsorption, desorption, and hydrogenation on the (

For ex- ample, the total coverage is reduced to 0.085 ML on both alloys for θH = 0.23 ML. However, for θH 0.25 ML, site blocking is much more effective on this alloy than on the (2 × 2) alloy and 1,3-butadiene chemisorption is completely blocked at θH = 0.34 ML. The yield of desorbed butene θC4H8 increases from zero on the clean alloy to a broad maxi- mum with increasing H precoverage until, at θH = 0.26 ML,it starts to decrease with additional θH because of the sharp decline in the amount of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene avail- able. Increasing θH also decreases the amount of desorbed 1,3-butadiene θC4H6, but in this case the curve tracks much more closely the curve of the decrease in the total amount of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene.
Preadsorbed H adatoms certainly increase the conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene on the
3 alloy, almost lin- early with increasing θH from a value of zero to 0.3 when θH = 0.34 ML. However, this can be compared with a con- version of 65% on the (2 × 2) alloy at this value of θH.
Conversion never climbs higher than 0.3 on the
3 alloy. As on the (2×2) alloy, hydrogenation on the
3 alloy is in com- petition with other processes on the surface during heating in TPD. H2 desorption when θH < 2 × θC4H6 indicates that hydrogenation competes with H recombination. Hydrogena- tion also competes with 1,3-butadiene desorption, which oc- curs even in cases of θH > 2 × θC4H6.
4. Discussion
The addition of alloyed Sn in Pt surfaces weakens the bonding of hydrocarbons, such as alkenes and dienes, and this has been known for some time. The hydrogen coad- sorption experiments reported here greatly extend our un- 30

derstanding of the influence of alloyed Sn on the chem- istry and catalysis that occurs on Pt surfaces by revealing how this weakened bonding alters the influence of coad- sorbed hydrogen on adsorption, desorption, and hydrogena- tion rates.
Blocking of strong adsorption sites by preadsorbed H adatoms on Pt(111) has been reported previously [28].
We also observed this H adatom site-blocking effect for 1,3-butadiene adsorption on H-precovered Pt(111) and have proposed why this could be a general phenomenon for other hydrocarbons [18]. Such a site-blocking effect of pread- sorbed H was also observed in this work for 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on both Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. What is interesting is to realize how alloyed Sn increases the impor- tance of this effect, that is, why much smaller amounts of hydrogen are needed to block chemisorption on the alloy surfaces. Even though the monolayer saturation coverage of chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene (0.15 ML) is nearly the same on Pt(111) and the (2 × 2) and
3 alloys, the amount of pread- sorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on Pt(111) is θH = 0.91 ML, but θH = 0.49 and 0.34 ML on the (2 × 2) and
3 alloy, respectively. The implications of this behavior are clear. One H adatom per unit cell on Pt(111), adsorbed in a three-fold hollow site,produces a saturation coverage of 1 ML. Each Pt at the sur- face has a nearest-neighbor H adatom, and this evidently passivates the surface against additional H atom uptake and strong 1,3-butadiene chemisorption. On the (2 × 2) alloy,two H adatoms per unit cell, adsorbed in pure Pt, 3-fold hol- low sites, produces a saturation coverage of 0.5 ML. The two H adatoms occupy one fcc and one hcp site, with each Pt at the surface having a nearest-neighbor H adatom, and one Pt per unit cell having two nearest-neighbor H adatoms. This evidently passivates the surface against additional H atom uptake and strong 1,3-butadiene chemisorption. Only one H adatom per unit cell on the
3 alloy is required for this pas- sivation. Each H adatom is presumed to be adsorbed in a pure Pt, 2-fold bridge site at the center of each unit cell to produce a saturation coverage of 0.33 ML. Each Pt at the sur- face has a nearest-neighbor H adatom. Obviously, electronic structure calculations are needed to validate and establish such proposals, but we hope these arguments stimulate such work.
Another significant difference in the chemistry of coad- sorbed hydrogen on Pt(111) compared with that on the two Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces is the reactivity for hydrogenat- ing 1,3-butadiene. On Pt(111), chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene is completely irreversibly adsorbed and completely de- composes to liberate H2 and form surface carbon [19].
This chemistry is unaffected by coadsorbed hydrogen, and,specifically, no butene desorption occurs [18]. This may in- dicate that dehydrogenation occurs more easily on Pt(111) than hydrogenation, or possibly that the hydrogenation bar- rier of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene is larger than the H2 desorption barrier for coadsorbed H adatoms. The ad- sorption energy of 1,3-butadiene is decreased on the two Sn/Pt(111) alloy surfaces, and alloying has an even stronger affect on 1,3-butadiene decomposition; that is, decomposi- tion is nearly eliminated on the (2 × 2) alloy and completely eliminated on the
3 alloy [19]. This is due to an increase in the CH bond breaking barrier. On both alloys contain- ing preadsorbed hydrogen, a significant amount of butene desorption from the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene occurs.
This activity is much larger on the (2 × 2) alloy, and 100% conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene is achieved at high values of θH (near 0.5 ML).We did not determine which butene isomer (1-butene, cis- or trans-2-butene, or isobutene) was produced in our TPD experiments. Both 1-butene and cis-2-butene desorb at low coverage on the (2 × 2) alloy at 270 K and on the
3 alloy below 220 K [27]. Thus, butene desorption at temperatures higher than those in Figs. 2 and 5 is rate-limited by hy- drogenation reactions. Butene produced at 170183 K by hydrogenation of weakly adsorbed, π-bonded species ap- pears to be reaction rate limited, but butene evolution at 140145 K occurs at about the temperature at which butene desorbs from physisorbed layers, and so we do not distin- guish the limiting kinetics in this case.
Reaction rate-limited butene desorption peaks in TPD can be used to estimate the hydrogenation reaction barrier Ea for strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene on the two surface alloys (i.e., Ed = Ea). The single butene desorption peak at 354 K on the (2×2) alloy with θH = 0.16-ML H corresponds to a hydrogenation reaction barrier of Ea = 91 kJ/mol. On the
3 alloy with θH = 0.13-ML H, the two butene des- orption peaks at 282 and 348 K correspond to Ea = 72 and 90 kJ/mol, respectively.
Surface-bound butenyl groups,either 1-butenyl (CH2CH2CH=CH2) or 2-butenyl (CH(CH3)CH=CH2),are considered to be reaction intermediates in 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation on Pt surfaces at high pressure [12]. Al- though there is no spectroscopic evidence at this time for butenyl groups on H-precovered Sn/Pt(111) alloys, it is rea- sonable to assume that hydrogenation occurs on these alloys through such intermediates. Our TPD data provide some clues that an additional path exists on the
3 alloy. We observed two reaction-rate-limited butene desorption peaks and a high-temperature 1,3-butadiene desorption peak. In previous studies, surface-bound ethyl groups (CH3CH2) were observed to produce ethylene and ethane on the
3 al- loy at 376 K through self-hydrogenation [29]. Surface-bound butenyl groups would be expected to react via β-H elimina- tion to produce butadiene and butane simultaneously. On the H-precovered
3 alloy, all hydrogen desorbs before 330 K and thus is not available for hydrogenation reactions at higher temperatures. This strongly suggests that the butene desorption peak at 348 K is from self-hydrogenation of surface-bound butenyl groups. This conclusion is also sup- ported by observation of 1,3-butadiene desorption at 361 K.
Apparently, high coverages of H adatoms are able to hy- drogenate weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene species on both alloys. On the
3 alloy at θH = 0.31 ML, a particu-

31 larly weakly bound state of H adatoms exists on the surface,and these species recombine and desorb as H2 at 217 K,as presented in Fig. 6. These species cause a new, weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene species to form that desorbs at 177 K, as shown in Fig. 4, and are implicated in the hy- drogenation of these 1,3-butadiene species to form butane,which desorbs in a new peak at 183 K.
Both Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys have 100% selectivity for the conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene versus butane; bu- tane was never detected as a desorbed product in these ex- periments. This observation is promising for applications of SnPt bimetallic catalysts in the selective removal of dienes from alkene feeds. This selectivity is caused in part by the decrease in the butene adsorption energy when Sn is alloyed with Pt(111). Butene desorbs before any hydrogenation re- action occurs because the butene desorption activation en- ergy barrier is lower than that of the hydrogenation reaction barrier, based on our previous studies of ethylene hydrogena- tion [17].
Reactions on the two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys at low θH can be summarized by the following scheme:(2 × 2) alloy C4H6(ad) C4H6(g)
283 K,
(1) 2H(ad) H2(g)
347 K,
(2) H(ad) + C4H6(ad) C4H7(ad)

285 K,
(8) 2C4H7(ad) C4H6(g) + C4H8(g)
348361 K.
(9) Although θC4H6 is larger on the
3 alloy than on the (2 × 2) alloy at the same value of θH, the 1,3-butadiene con- version to butene is smaller on the
3 alloy because the H2 desorption activation energy on the
3 alloy is a lit- tle smaller than that for 1,3-butadiene. This causes more of the coadsorbed H to recombine and desorb as H2. On the (2 × 2) alloy, recombinative H2 and 1,3-butadiene desorp- tion have similar activation energies, and this results in more extensive hydrogenation reactions. These arguments lead to the conclusion that hydrogenation reactions are maximized when 1,3-butadiene and recombinative H2 desorption have the same activation energies. In practical catalysts, this syn- ergy might be exploited by control of the Sn concentration in the supported SnPt catalysts.
5. Conclusions
Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hy- drogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selec- tively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This hydrogenation reaction was observed on both of the two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys investigated. No further hydrogenation reactions pro- ducing butane were observed. We estimated the activation energy barriers to hydrogenation of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) al- loy and
3 alloys, respectively, by considering the butene desorption that occurs at 354 and 282 K. 1,3-Butadiene hy- drogenation occurs in competition with 1,3-butadiene des- orption and hydrogen adatom recombination to desorb H2,and the relative rates vary with θH and depend on the al- loy surface. The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the
3 alloy. This leads to high coverages of both re- actants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn con- centration.
Hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene presumably proceeds through surface-bound butenyl groups as intermediates on both alloys to produce reaction-rate-limited butene desorp- tion at 282354 K. In addition, on the
3 alloy, self hy- drogenation of surface butenyl groups also occurs during heating in TPD and produces butene desorption at 348 K.
We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol.
Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), that is, θH = 0.49 and
0.34 ML on the (2×2) and
3 alloy, respectively, compared with θH = 0.91 on Pt(111). We propose a simple model for hydrogen adsorption to explain these changes.
