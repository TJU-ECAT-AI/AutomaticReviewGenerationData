Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modi- fied by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
[2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic prop- erties of a catalyst [8]."
[3] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are impor- tant, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
[4] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

1.The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important, it is often unclear which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. Understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

1.金属纳米颗粒的催化性能可以通过改变表面几何形状（由于粒子大小的改变）或通过添加促进剂或形成合金来改变电子性质而被修改。与另一种金属合金化也会影响催化剂的电子性质。虽然众所周知催化剂的这两个方面都很重要，但通常不清楚对于特定反应，哪一个因素对选择性控制的贡献更大。然而，了解特定反应中哪个因素占主导地位，可以用来设计更有效的催化剂。

[2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst [8]."
[3] "Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and rel- ative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridiza- tion of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms."

1.金属纳米颗粒的催化性能可以通过改变表面几何形状（由于粒子大小的改变）或通过添加促进剂或形成合金来改变电子性质而得到修改。与另一种金属合金化也会影响催化剂的电子性质。当金属合金化时，两个效应同时发生：由于价轨道填充水平和相对能量的差异，合金元素之间可能会发生电荷转移；由于金属原子间键合距离的变化，金属间键合的杂化可能会发生变化。虽然众所周知催化剂的这两个方面都很重要，但通常不知道对于特定反应，哪个因素对选择性控制的贡献更大。然而，理解特定反应中哪个因素占主导地位可以用来设计更优秀的催化剂。
