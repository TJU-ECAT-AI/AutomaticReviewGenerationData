[1] "The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in the surface geometry due to modification of the particle size or changes in the electronic properties by the addition of promoters or alloy formation."
[2] "Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst [8]."
[3] "Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are important, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction."
[4] "However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."

1.The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be modified by changes in surface geometry due to particle size modification or changes in electronic properties by adding promoters or forming alloys. Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst. Although both geometric and electronic effects are important for catalysts, it is often unclear which factor contributes more to selectivity control for a specific reaction. However, understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts.

1.金属纳米颗粒的催化性能可以通过改变表面几何形状（由于粒子大小的改变）或通过添加促进剂或形成合金来改变电子性质而被修改。与另一种金属合金化也会影响催化剂的电子性质。虽然众所周知催化剂的这两个方面都很重要，但通常不清楚对于特定反应，哪一个因素对选择性控制的贡献更大。然而，了解特定反应中哪个因素占主导地位，可以用来设计更优秀的催化剂。
