1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance. However, it does show that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalysts by control of the Sn concentration.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息。但是，它确实表明，将Sn与Pt(111)合金化开辟了一条新的氢化途径，在TPD中加热H和1,3-丁二烯的共吸附层时，选择性地产生丁烯。在(2 × 2)合金上观察到从1,3-丁二烯到丁烯的最高转化率，这可能是由于(2 × 2)合金上H2和1,3-丁二烯的脱附活化能几乎匹配，与(3 × 3)R30合金相比。这导致在最高温度下两种反应物的高覆盖率，这种协同作用可能通过控制Sn浓度在实际催化剂中得到利用。
