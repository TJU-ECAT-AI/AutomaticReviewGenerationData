1.The document does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, selectively producing butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the introduction of a second metal can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, influencing its reactivity and selectivity. The study also observes that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that geometric changes in the catalyst surface can affect the adsorption and reaction of molecules. These findings imply that by carefully controlling the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, it may be possible to optimize their performance for specific reactions.

1.文档没有提供过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有概述利用这种相互作用设计更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统的创新策略。然而，它确实强调了在Pt(111)上合金化Sn开辟了一条新的氢化途径，在TPD中加热H和1,3-丁二烯的共吸附层时，选择性地产生丁烯。这表明引入第二种金属可以改变催化剂的电子结构，影响其反应性和选择性。研究还观察到，完全阻止两种合金上1,3-丁二烯化学吸附所需的预吸附氢的数量远小于Pt(111)所需的数量，表明催化剂表面的几何变化可以影响分子的吸附和反应。这些发现表明，通过仔细控制双金属催化剂的组成和结构，可能优化其特定反应的性能。
