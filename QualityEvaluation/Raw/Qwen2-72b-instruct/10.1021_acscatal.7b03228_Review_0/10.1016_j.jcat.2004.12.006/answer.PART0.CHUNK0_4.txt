1.The literature does not provide specific information on how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, nor does it outline innovative strategies for exploiting this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. However, it does highlight that alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This suggests that the geometric and electronic effects of alloying can influence catalytic performance. The literature also shows that the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to completely block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), indicating that alloying can alter the reactivity of the surface. These observations may be exploited in practical catalysts by controlling the Sn concentration.

1.文献没有提供过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的具体信息，也没有概述利用这种相互作用设计更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统的创新策略。然而，它确实强调了与Pt(111)上的化学相比，将Sn与Pt(111)合金化开辟了一条新的氢化途径，可以在TPD中加热H和1,3-丁二烯的共吸附层时选择性地产生丁烯。这表明合金化中的几何和电子效应可以影响催化性能。文献还表明，完全阻止两种合金上1,3-丁二烯化学吸附所需的预吸附氢的数量远小于Pt(111)所需的数量，表明合金化可以改变表面的反应性。这些观察结果可能通过控制Sn浓度在实际催化剂中得到利用。
