[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
[2] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
[3] "The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals."
[4] "The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center."
[5] "The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys."
[6] "The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals."
[7] "The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below."
[8] "The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
[9] "The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b."
[10] "The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength."
[11] "The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states."
[12] "The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
[13] "The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily."
[14] "The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy."
[15] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
[16] "It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another."
[17] "In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys."
[18] "This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated."
[19] "It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy."
[20] "When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5."
[21] "Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
[22] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the relative chemical reactivity of alloy sites based on their geometric structure and electronic properties. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationship between the alloy's geometric structure and the electronic properties of the d-band, which can be used to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

[14] "The fact that the adsorption energies for the adsorption on the Pt surface sites scale as r 3/2 dm , where r dm is the spatial extent of d orbitals of metals which are in contact with the Pt surface sites, is not surprising since according to the tight bonding approximation (Atomic Sphere Approximation) for a fixed geometry (bond distance between the elements that form an alloy) the d-band width projected on a given atom in an alloy is proportional to r 3/2 dm ."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys influence catalytic performance by affecting the chemical reactivity of the alloy. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. The d-band model, which relates the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal to its chemical reactivity, has predictive capacity for pure monatomic metals. However, in alloys, additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another affect the position of the d-band center. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity, which can be predicted by the width of the localized d-band, a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy. This allows for the prediction of the chemical reactivity of various sites in alloys, leading to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1.Predicting the chemical reactivity of pure metals is relatively simple, but doing the same for alloys is more challenging. A model has been proposed that uses experimental analysis and quantum chemical DFT calculations to predict the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of different sites in alloys. The model's central feature is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, and the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. The d-band model has predictive capacity for pure monatomic metals and has been used to understand the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals. However, in alloys, additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another can affect the position of the d-band center. The transfer of charge from one alloy element to another complicates the physical picture and makes it difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys. The results for Ni alloys have been shown in previous contributions. To understand the origin of the 3d-metal-induced shifts in the position of the local d-band center and the chemical reactivity of Pt sites, various mechanisms that can affect the position of the d-band center localized on an atom in metal alloys were discussed. A critical consequence is that since the local d-charge on alloy atoms is preserved upon the formation of alloys, the local d-band center and the chemical reactivity of the atoms in different alloys are mainly functions of the local d-band width. Another important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry, the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site. The studies show that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center and the local chemical reactivity are governed by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy. Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and the chemical reactivity of these sites can be predicted easily. The definition of charge transfer used in the analysis is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated. Small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the changes in the center of the d-band.

1.预测纯金属的化学反应性相对简单，但对合金做同样的预测更具挑战性。已经提出了一种模型，该模型使用实验分析和量子化学DFT计算来预测合金化对合金中不同位点的局部电子结构和化学反应性的影响。该模型的核心特征是，合金中d轨道的杂化不会导致合金组分元素之间发生显著的电荷转移，而局部d态密度投影到位点上的宽度是描述该位点化学反应性的一个极佳指标。d带模型对纯单原子金属具有预测能力，并已被用于理解过渡金属和贵金属的相对化学活性。然而，在合金中，额外的因素，如一个元素向另一个元素的电子电荷转移，可能除了d轨道之间的重叠之外，还会影响d带中心的位置。一个合金元素向另一个合金元素的电荷转移进一步复杂化了物理图景，并且很难设计出一个普遍的模型来捕捉合金的一般行为。Ni合金的结果已在以前的贡献中显示。为了理解3d金属诱导的局部d带中心位置变化以及Pt位点化学反应性的起源，讨论了可以影响金属合金中定位在原子上的d带中心位置的各种机制。一个关键的后果是，由于合金原子上的局部d电荷在合金形成时得以保存，因此不同合金中原子的局部d带中心和化学反应性主要取决于局部d带的宽度。另一个重要的后果是，对于固定位点几何形状，定位在位点上的d带的宽度，以及因此的d带中心和局部化学反应性，仅是形成该位点的原子轨道的空间范围的唯一函数。从这些研究中得出的图景是，当两种过渡金属被带到一起形成合金时，局部d带中心位置（因此是局部化学反应性）的变化在很大程度上仅由局部d带的宽度决定，该宽度是合金几何形状（合金原子之间的键长）和形成合金的金属原子的d轨道的空间范围的唯一函数。由于合金中组成元素之间的键长可以被预测，而合金中轨道的空间范围是已知的，因此可以轻松预测合金中各种位点的d带中心位置以及这些位点的化学反应性。在分析中使用的电荷转移定义是普遍的，因为它独立于积分电荷的截止半径。s/p带填充的小变化对吸附能的影响远小于上述d带中心变化的影响。

1.Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by affecting the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but it changes the width of the local density of d-states, which is a good descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. The d-band model, which has predictive capacity for pure monatomic metals, becomes more complex in alloys due to additional factors such as alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling. However, by considering the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site and the alloy geometry, the chemical reactivity of sites in alloys can be predicted. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding these relationships, which can lead to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

[14] "Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily."
[15] "The main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons."
[16] "It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by affecting the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity of the alloy sites. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, but it does change the width of the local density of d-states, which is a good descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site. This allows for the prediction of the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity. Innovative strategies can be developed by understanding the relationships between the geometric structure of alloys and their chemical reactivity, which can lead to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.

1.过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能，通过影响合金位点的局部电子结构和化学反应性。合金中d轨道的杂化不会在组成元素之间导致显著的电荷转移，但会改变局部d态密度的宽度，这是位点化学反应性的一个良好描述符。这使得能够预测合金化对局部电子结构和化学反应性的影响。通过理解合金几何结构与其化学反应性之间的关系，可以开发创新策略，设计出比传统单金属催化剂更高效、更选择性、更可调的催化系统。
