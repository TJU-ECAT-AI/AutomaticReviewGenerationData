[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
[2] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
[4] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
[5] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
[6] "To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, one should work not only to develop good catalysts but also to elucidate the process of catalysis at an atomic level. Therefore, to avoid complications in mechanistic studies, meeting the following criteria is desirable: (a) high phase purity, (b) use of inert supports or bulk materials, and (c) simple reaction conditions. Satisfying these concerns will reinforce the reliability of mechanistic studies, characterizations, and theoretical approaches."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic state of the active metal. The ensemble effect, which is a geometric effect, can increase selectivity for allowed reactions by decreasing the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles. The electronic effect can improve catalytic properties by changing the electronic state of the active metal, which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal. Innovative strategies can be developed by exploiting these effects to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts. For example, intermetallic phases can provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation. They can also suppress undesired side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide O2 adsorption sites, and act as precursors of active components for oxidation and steam reforming. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts, it is desirable to have high phase purity, use inert supports or bulk materials, and have simple reaction conditions.

1.间金属化合物已被分类为三个主要类别：氢化/脱氢，氧化和蒸汽重整。间金属相的基本作用已被分类为四种类型的效果：电子，几何，立体和排序效果。间金属化合物是有希望的无机催化剂材料，能够创建精心设计的反应环境，并适合开发高效的催化系统。在双金属系统中，两种类型的金属以各种状态存在，例如合金，核心壳结构和金属氧化物复合物。合金根据其结构分为两类：固溶合金和间金属化合物。固溶合金由具有相似原子大小和电子特性的金属组成，具有与母金属相同的晶体结构和随机原子排列。如果一个元素的原子足够小，可以适应另一个元素的晶格空隙，则可以形成间隙固溶合金。间金属化合物涉及相反的情况，其中组分金属具有显著不同的特性，并且具有高度有序的原子排列的独立晶体结构。两种金属的相似性可以通过它们在周期表中的相对位置粗略估计。众所周知，固溶合金长期以来一直被广泛用作催化剂材料进行测试。相比之下，间金属化合物已被研究用于具有独特物理性质的块状材料的应用，例如超导性，形状记忆效应和氢储存能力。然而，直到最近，它们很少被研究用于催化反应，为间金属催化剂化学的发展留下了一个所谓的蓝海区域。合金和间金属催化剂的出版物数量每年都在增加，合金催化剂的上升趋势遵循金属催化剂的趋势，尽管总数并不高。这种上升趋势在2000年之后尤为突出，使双金属催化化学成为一个热门话题。相比之下，关于间金属催化剂的文献作品数量远低于合金或金属催化剂。然而，最近出版物数量的增加表明，该领域也受到了越来越多的关注。此外，从这些研究中获得的见解表明，间金属化合物作为催化剂材料的潜力高于传统的无机催化剂材料。为了促进发展并朝着在不久的将来建立间金属催化剂化学的方向努力，有必要产生并分享关于间金属催化剂可以做什么，它们在增强催化作用中的基本作用以及它们相对于其他无机材料的优势的全面理解。

This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
[2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."
[3] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character. (281, 282) According to this model, the adsorptivity and reactivity are determined by the position of the center of mass of d electrons and holes (d band centers) relative to the Fermi level. This is because the d band center determines the positions of bonding and antibonding states, and hence the degree of filling of the antibonding states."
[4] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
[5] "Thus, in a commonly used sense, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, (278, 293) which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."
[6] "Another approach to studying an intrinsic ensemble effect was recently reported by Widmer et al. using well-defined PdGa(111) and (111) surfaces. (294) Although these two surfaces have equal surface symmetries and very similar electronic structures, the atomic configurations of Pd differ significantly: (111) has a separated 3-fold Pd3 trimer, whereas (111) has an isolated single Pd1 atom. These specific characteristics allow the intrinsic ensemble effect to be studied with a minimum contribution from ligand effects."
[7] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."
[8] "The relationship between the selectivity and Ead has a physical meaning as represented in eq 1:where rx, NSx, NS, and Ex (x = NO2 or CC) are the hydrogenation rate of x, adsorbed NS with x, unadsorbed NS, and adsorption energy of NS with x, respectively. The equation indicates the conversion of the rate ratio to the adsorbate concentration ratio and represents the fraction of adsorbed NS using the Boltzmann distribution equation with its Ead. As a consequence, a simple proportional relationship is found between the logarithm of the rate ratio and ΔE."
[9] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."
[10] "In this section, we have summarized the various effects that control the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds (i.e., electronic, geometric, steric, and ordering effects). It is noteworthy that the electronic state and the surface environment of the catalyst can be well controlled by an appropriate choice of a bimetallic combination and composition. This allows for more sophisticated fine-tuning of the catalyst design compared with conventional techniques for inorganic heterogeneous catalysts."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the surface environment and electronic structure of the catalyst. The geometric effect, known as the ensemble effect, decreases the coordination number and size of active metal ensembles, affecting adsorption and reactions that require large ensembles. This increases selectivity for allowed reactions. The electronic effect, or ligand effect, modifies the electronic states of the parent metal, changing the heat of adsorption and activation barrier, which impacts catalytic activity and selectivity. The d band theory explains that the position of the d band center relative to the Fermi level determines the adsorptivity and reactivity of the catalyst. By forming intermetallic phases, the electronic state of the active metal can be drastically changed or controlled, improving catalytic properties. The electronic states can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal, allowing for the development of a well-designed reaction environment. The ensemble effect can also refer to the change in adsorption energy due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which can drive changes in adsorption mode. Studying the intrinsic ensemble effect on well-defined surfaces with similar electronic structures but different atomic configurations allows for the separation of ligand effects. The second metal atom can act as a functional site, promoting the desired reaction through preferential adsorption of specific molecules or functional groups. The relationship between selectivity and adsorption energy can be represented by an equation, showing a simple proportional relationship between the logarithm of the rate ratio and the energy difference. The ordering effect refers to the improvement in catalytic performance when an ordered alloy is superior to a disordered alloy with the same metal compositions and crystal systems. These effects can be exploited in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by controlling the electronic state and surface environment through the choice of bimetallic combination and composition.

Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
[2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."
[3] "Thus, we here show that the electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
[4] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."
[5] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by changing the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface and modifying the electronic states of the parent metal. The ensemble effect, a geometric effect, decreases the coordination number of the surface and the size of metal ensembles, increasing selectivity for allowed reactions. The ligand effect, an electronic effect, changes the catalytic or adsorption properties by modifying the electronic states of the parent metal. The electronic state of the active metal can be controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases and the choice of the second metal. The site addition effect, a geometric effect, allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules and spatial separation of other molecules, promoting the desired reaction. The ordering effect, the difference in catalytic performance between ordered and disordered alloys, can also influence catalytic performance. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by designing bimetallic catalysts with specific geometric and electronic properties, such as controlling the size and coordination number of metal ensembles, modifying the electronic states of the parent metal, and choosing the appropriate second metal and alloy structure.

[1] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7) Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds. (8) The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a). If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b).

In addition, several Pt-based catalysts that operate under relatively mild conditions have also been developed in recent years.
