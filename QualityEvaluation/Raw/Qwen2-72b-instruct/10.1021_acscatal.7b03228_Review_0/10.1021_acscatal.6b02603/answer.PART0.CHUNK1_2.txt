[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions. This geometric effect is called an ensemble effect. (279) In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96) As mentioned occasionally in section 3, ensemble effects have been frequently associated with various selective conversions."
[2] "The term ligand effect is used for a change in the catalytic or adsorption properties by modification of the electronic states of the parent metal on alloying with a second metal. (278) Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect. (279) However, these days, this term has been used almost synonymously with electronic effects. (278, 280) The degree of modification depends strongly on the nature and composition of the second metal. In general, a drastic change in the electronic state critically affects the heat of adsorption and the activation barrier, thereby altering catalytic activity and/or selectivity."
[3] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps. On the basis of this concept, the HammerNrskov d band model, the so-called d band theory, has been developed to establish a clear-cut relationship between reactivity and d band character. (281, 282) According to this model, the adsorptivity and reactivity are determined by the position of the center of mass of d electrons and holes (d band centers) relative to the Fermi level. This is because the d band center determines the positions of bonding and antibonding states, and hence the degree of filling of the antibonding states."
[4] "The electronic state of the active metal can be changed drastically and/or controlled by the formation of intermetallic phases, which can improve the catalytic property. It is also important that the electronic states can be controlled by an appropriate choice of the second metal, which is necessary for developing a well-designed reaction environment."
[5] "Thus, in a commonly used sense, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, (278, 293) which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."
[6] "Another approach to studying an intrinsic ensemble effect was recently reported by Widmer et al. using well-defined PdGa(111) and (111) surfaces. (294) Although these two surfaces have equal surface symmetries and very similar electronic structures, the atomic configurations of Pd differ significantly: (111) has a separated 3-fold Pd3 trimer, whereas (111) has an isolated single Pd1 atom. These specific characteristics allow the intrinsic ensemble effect to be studied with a minimum contribution from ligand effects."
[7] "For ensemble effects, the second metal atom is present as a spacer that separates the active metal atoms. In contrast, for some intermetallic catalysts, the second metal atom acts as a chemically functional site, such as an anchoring site for alcohols, carbonyl groups, or molecular oxygen. This allows preferential adsorption of specific molecules (or functional groups) and/or spatial separation of the other molecule or group that should be protected from the active metal, promoting the desired reaction. Therefore, this kind of effect, termed site addition, can also be categorized as a geometric effect."
[8] "The relationship between the selectivity and Ead has a physical meaning as represented in eq 1:where rx, NSx, NS, and Ex (x = NO2 or CC) are the hydrogenation rate of x, adsorbed NS with x, unadsorbed NS, and adsorption energy of NS with x, respectively. The equation indicates the conversion of the rate ratio to the adsorbate concentration ratio and represents the fraction of adsorbed NS using the Boltzmann distribution equation with its Ead. As a consequence, a simple proportional relationship is found between the logarithm of the rate ratio and ΔE."
[9] "The major difference between intermetallic compounds and solid-solution alloys is whether the structure is ordered or disordered. Therefore, if the catalytic performance of an ordered alloy is superior to that of a disordered alloy with identical metal compositions and crystal systems, the resulting improvement should be termed ordering effect."
[10] "In this section, we have summarized the various effects that control the catalytic performance of intermetallic compounds (i.e., electronic, geometric, steric, and ordering effects). It is noteworthy that the electronic state and the surface environment of the catalyst can be well controlled by an appropriate choice of a bimetallic combination and composition. This allows for more sophisticated fine-tuning of the catalyst design compared with conventional techniques for inorganic heterogeneous catalysts."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the surface environment and electronic structure of the catalyst. The geometric effect, known as the ensemble effect, decreases the coordination number and size of active metal ensembles, affecting adsorption and reactions that require large ensembles. This increases selectivity for allowed reactions. The electronic effect, or ligand effect, modifies the electronic states of the parent metal, changing the heat of adsorption and activation barrier, which impacts catalytic activity and selectivity. The d band theory explains that the position of the d band center relative to the Fermi level determines the adsorptivity and reactivity of the catalyst. By forming intermetallic phases, the electronic state of the active metal can be drastically changed or controlled, improving catalytic properties. The electronic states can be controlled by choosing an appropriate second metal, allowing for the development of a well-designed reaction environment. The ensemble effect can also refer to the change in adsorption energy due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, which can drive changes in adsorption mode. Studying the intrinsic ensemble effect on well-defined surfaces with similar electronic structures but different atomic configurations allows for the separation of ligand effects. The second metal atom can act as a functional site, promoting the desired reaction through preferential adsorption of specific molecules or functional groups. The relationship between selectivity and adsorption energy can be represented by an equation, showing a simple proportional relationship between the logarithm of the rate ratio and the energy difference. The ordering effect refers to the improvement in catalytic performance when an ordered alloy is superior to a disordered alloy with the same metal compositions and crystal systems. These effects can be exploited in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by controlling the electronic state and surface environment through the choice of bimetallic combination and composition.
