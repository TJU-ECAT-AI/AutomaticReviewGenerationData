[1] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7) Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds. (8) The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a). If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b). The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c). (8)"
[2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
[3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
[4] "The electronic effect is one of the most important factors that govern the catalytic properties of intermetallic compounds. The electronic state of the catalytically active metal is significantly modified by the presence of the second metal, which changes the adsorption properties of the reactants and products."
[5] "The geometric effect is another important factor that governs the catalytic properties of intermetallic compounds. The specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds provide unique active sites that are not available in monometallic catalysts."
[6] "The steric effect is a unique feature of intermetallic compounds that is not observed in other bimetallic systems. The specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds provide steric constraints that prevent the adsorption of large molecules, leading to high selectivity for small molecules."
[7] "The ordering effect is a unique feature of intermetallic compounds that is not observed in other bimetallic systems. The highly ordered atomic arrangements of intermetallic compounds provide a well-defined reaction environment that is suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."

1.The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by modifying the electronic state of the catalytically active metal and providing unique active sites that are not available in monometallic catalysts. The electronic state of the catalytically active metal is significantly modified by the presence of the second metal, which changes the adsorption properties of the reactants and products. The specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds provide unique active sites that are not available in monometallic catalysts. The steric effect is a unique feature of intermetallic compounds that is not observed in other bimetallic systems. The specific surface structures of intermetallic compounds provide steric constraints that prevent the adsorption of large molecules, leading to high selectivity for small molecules. The ordering effect is a unique feature of intermetallic compounds that is not observed in other bimetallic systems. The highly ordered atomic arrangements of intermetallic compounds provide a well-defined reaction environment that is suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by controlling the electronic and geometric properties of the intermetallic compounds through the selection of the component metals and the preparation methods.
