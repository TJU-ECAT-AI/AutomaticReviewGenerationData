[1] "A number of chemical transformations using intermetallic catalysts have been surveyed and classified into three major divisionshydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming and various subsections."
[2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
[3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
[4] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7)"
[5] "Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds."
[6] "The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a)."
[7] "If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b)."
[8] "The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c)."
[9] "In general, the similarity of two metals can be roughly estimated by their relative positions in the periodic table."
[10] "As is well-known, solid-solution alloys have been extensively tested as catalyst materials for a long time."
[11] "In contrast, intermetallic compounds have been investigated for their applications to bulk materials with unique physical properties such as superconductivity, (14, 15) shape-memory effects, (16) and hydrogen storage capability. (17, 18)"
[12] "However, until recently, they have rarely been studied for use in catalytic reactions, leaving a so-called blue ocean area for developments in the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts."
[13] "This situation is clearly represented in Figure 2, which shows the annual increase in the number of publications on alloys and intermetallic catalysts."
[14] "Note that the actual numbers of the corresponding studies may be much longer than those shown in Figure 2, which only roughly reflects the trend in research."
[15] "The upward trend for alloy catalysts follows that for metallic catalysts, although the total number is not as high."
[16] "This upward trend is particularly prominent after 2000, making the chemistry of bimetallic catalysis as a hot topic."
[17] "In contrast, the number of literature works on intermetallic catalysts is much smaller than that of alloy or metal catalysts."
[18] "However, the recent increase in publications suggests that this field has also received growing attention."
[19] "Moreover, the insights obtained from these studies suggest that the potential of intermetallic compounds for catalyst materials is high compared to conventional inorganic catalyst materials."
[20] "To facilitate development and work toward establishing the chemistry of intermetallic catalysts in the near future, it is necessary to produce and share a comprehensive understanding about (1) what intermetallic catalysts can do, (2) their fundamental roles in enhanced catalysis, and (3) their advantages over other inorganic materials."

1.Intermetallic compounds, as a type of bimetallic system, have been widely studied in chemical transformations, including hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, oxidation, and steam reforming. Their fundamental roles in catalysis can be categorized into electronic, geometric, steric, and ordering effects. Intermetallic compounds have the potential to create a well-designed reaction environment and develop efficient catalytic systems. Compared with solid-solution alloys, intermetallic compounds have distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements, which can lead to unique catalytic properties. The geometric and electronic effects in intermetallic compounds can synergistically influence catalytic performance, providing opportunities for the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay, such as the precise control of the electronic structure, specific and ordered atomic-level structure, and homogeneity of geometric and electronic structures, to outperform traditional monometallic catalysts.
