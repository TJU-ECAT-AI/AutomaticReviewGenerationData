[1] "In bimetallic systems, two types of metals are present in various states, such as alloys, (4, 5) coreshell structures, (6, 7) and metaloxide composites. (6, 7) Alloys are classified into two categories depending on their structure: solid-solution alloys and intermetallic compounds. (8) The former, typically substitutional solid-solution alloys, consist of metals of similar atomic size and electronic character with a crystal structure identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements (Figure 1a). If the atoms of one element is sufficiently small to fit within the lattice void of the counterpart element, interstitial solid-solution alloys can be formed (Figure 1b). The latter involves the opposite situation to Figure 1a, where the component metals have significantly different characters and comprise distinct crystal structures with highly ordered atomic arrangements (Figure 1c). (8)"
[2] "The fundamental roles of intermetallic phases obtained from this survey were categorized into four types of effects: (a) electronic, (b) geometric, (c) steric, and (d) ordering effects."
[3] "Thus, intermetallic compounds are promising inorganic catalyst materials capable of creating a well-designed reaction environment and suitable for developing efficient catalytic systems."
[4] "The electronic effect on the adsorption property is very similar to that observed in alkyne semihydrogenation. Thus, it is likely that selective alkane dehydrogenation relies on both the geometric and electronic effects generated by the addition of Sn."
[5] "A DFT study on these Pb-containing materials suggested that the Pd3Pb(111) surface had much lower heat of adsorption of alkyne and alkene than the Pb-deposited Pd(111) surface. (106)"
[6] "A unique surface stereochemistry governed by a specific bimetallic structure allows one-atom hydrogenation for isomerization and inhibits two-atom hydrogenation to alkane, which is explained in detail in section 4.3."
[7] "The incorporated Sn atoms effectively dilute large Pt ensembles, which cause undesired side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, coke formation, and oligomerization. (135) However, 3-fold Pt sites remain on Pt3Sn(111) and act as the minimum active site for CH activation, affording sufficient catalytic activity."
[8] "An X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) (134) and XAFS (134, 139) study showed that the electron density of Pt increases by alloying with Sn. Downward shift of the d band center was also reported for a series of PtSn surfaces. (135) This modified electronic state changes the adsorption properties of Pt."
[9] "Indeed, many experimental (127) and computational approaches (135, 136) have revealed that adding Sn to Pt reduces the heat of propylene adsorption, which promotes desorption of propylene and suppresses successive side reactions."
[10] "The formation of a PdZn intermetallic phase drastically changes the adsorption affinity of Pd for alcohol and amine. On monometallic Pd, the adsorption of amine and the subsequent β-hydrogen activation are kinetically and thermodynamically preferred over those of alcohols. Conversely, this trend is inverted on PdZn, allowing selective adsorption and activation of alcohols for N-alkylation."
[11] "A DFT calculation for Pd(111) and PdZn(111) (described by a CuAu-type unit cell) surfaces revealed that the highly oxophilic character of Zn atoms in contrast to the azophilic character of Pd atoms contributed to the drastic change in adsorption affinity."
[12] "The use of ubiquitous metal elements and their good catalytic performances makes them a fascinating alternative to noble metal catalysts."
[13] "A similar result was also reported in the literature for RhIn/SiO2. In addition, several Pt-based catalysts that operate under relatively mild conditions have also been developed in recent years. (78, 83, 85) Many researchers consider isolation of Pt to be promising for selective nitro-hydrogenation. (78, 85) Indeed, to develop isolated Pt environments, some strategies such as single-atom dispersion (78) and ligand capping (85) have been adopted and demonstrated to be suitable."
[14] "A DFT study on these Pb-containing materials suggested that the Pd3Pb(111) surface had much lower heat of adsorption of alkyne and alkene than the Pb-deposited Pd(111) surface. (106)"
[15] "A DFT calculation for Pd(111) and PdZn(111) (described by a CuAu-type unit cell) surfaces revealed that the highly oxophilic character of Zn atoms in contrast to the azophilic character of Pd atoms contributed to the drastic change in adsorption affinity. (149)"

1.在双金属系统中，两种类型的金属以各种状态存在，例如合金，核心壳结构和金属氧化物复合物。合金根据其结构分为两类：固溶合金和金属间化合物。前者，通常是置换固溶合金，由具有相似原子大小和电子特性的金属组成，其晶体结构与母金属相同，具有随机的原子排列。如果一种元素的原子足够小，可以适应另一种元素的晶格空隙，则可以形成间隙固溶合金。后者涉及相反的情况，其中组分金属具有显著不同的特性，并且具有高度有序的原子排列和不同的晶体结构。
