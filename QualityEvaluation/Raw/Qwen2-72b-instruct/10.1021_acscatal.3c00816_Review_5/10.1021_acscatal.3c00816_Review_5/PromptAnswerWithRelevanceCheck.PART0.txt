[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."
[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates."
[3] "Compared to Pt-SnOx/TS-1, the hierarchical Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 possesses a higher surface area and weaker acidity, thus greatly improving the stability of the catalyst."
[4] "The optimized Pt-SnOx/10%TS-1@SBA-15 catalyst exhibits an initial propane conversion of 54.5% and was still as high as 52.4% after four reaction-regeneration cycles."
[5] "The alloyed PtLa, PtCe, and PtY structures and the hierarchical pores effectively contribute to the PDH performance and stability."
[6] "The optimized Pt3La intermetallic alloys on hierarchical zeolites exhibit an initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion), and the conversion remains >8% after 30 days of reaction."
[7] "The optimized PtY(1)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability with an initial propane conversion of 45% that lasted for 30 days."
[8] "The optimized Pt/Fe-3 catalyst obtains a propane conversion of 39.2% and a propylene selectivity of 96.2% with using undiluted propane reactants and a high propane WSHV of 17 h1, and no obvious deactivation was detected after 3 days reaction."
[9] "The optimized PtZn@S-1-Fin catalyst exhibits a propylene productivity of 15 molC3H6·molPt1·s1 at a high propane WHSV of 180 h1, which is superior to the reference catalysts with propylene productivity of 912 molC3H6·molPt1·s1."
