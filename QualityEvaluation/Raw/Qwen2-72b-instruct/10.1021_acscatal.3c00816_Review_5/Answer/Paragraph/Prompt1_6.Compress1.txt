Types include those with enhanced structures, boosting catalytic efficiency in reactions with bulky molecules. Synthesis involves structure directing agents and high-temperature processes. These zeolites improve PDH performance by better reactant accessibility, reduced metal aggregation, and increased active metal dispersion.", "Doi": "10.3390/catal9020174"},
{"DOC": "Hierarchical zeolites integrate micropores with meso/macropores, enhancing accessibility for PDH reactions without compromising confinement effects. Synthesis methods include desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, and cotemplating with TPAOH and TBPOH. These materials offer higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability, boosting propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Intermetallic compounds formed in hierarchical structures contribute to enhanced PDH performance and stability. Hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites have higher silanol concentrations, leading to superior catalytic lifetime.
