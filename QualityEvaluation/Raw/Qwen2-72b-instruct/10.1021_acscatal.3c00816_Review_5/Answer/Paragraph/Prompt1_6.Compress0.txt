{"Quotes": "[1] \"A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]. However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]. With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40].\"", "English": "Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which greatly improves the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites.

This material combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content showed the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which is higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species.", "Doi": "10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7"}
