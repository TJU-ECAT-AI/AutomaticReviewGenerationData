Hierarchical zeolites, by integrating micropores with mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. This structural amalgamation facilitates improved metal species dispersion through increased defect sites, thereby boosting catalytic efficiency, especially in reactions involving bulky molecules \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. The synthesis of these materials typically involves the use of structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes \[10.3390/catal9020174\].

    The enhanced accessibility of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions is achieved without compromising the confinement effects that are crucial for catalytic activity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Synthesized through methods such as desilication, self-assembly, and the use of bifunctional surfactants or cotemplates like TPAOH and TBPOH, these zeolites offer higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The hierarchical structure facilitates the formation of intermetallic compounds, boosts silanol concentration, and strengthens metal-support interactions, leading to higher propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and overall PDH performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\].

    Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include in situ and postsynthetic approaches, involving hard and soft templating routes \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. Hard templating employs sacrificial templates to create additional porosity, while soft templating uses polymers and surfactants to tailor mesopores \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. Indirect templating synthesizes hierarchical zeolites by partial crystallization or deposition onto mesoporous skeletons \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. These materials improve PDH reaction performance through enhanced mass transport properties, higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\].

    A composite material, TS-1@SBA-16, combining micropores and mesopores for enhanced PDH reaction accessibility, was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The 10% TS-1 content catalyst showed the highest PDH activity, achieving 54.5% initial propane conversion, outperforming TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The superior performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to its hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and the electronic effect of Ti species \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\].

    
    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions, as detailed in the file, open up new avenues for exploration in the field of catalysis. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites using various methods, such as desilication, self-assembly, and templating, presents opportunities for the development of novel synthesis strategies that could further enhance the accessibility and catalytic efficiency of these materials. Future research might focus on the optimization of synthesis conditions to achieve more precise control over the hierarchical structure, aiming to maximize the synergistic effects of micropores and mesopores/macropores. Additionally, the investigation of new structure directing agents and the exploration of alternative synthesis routes could lead to the discovery of hierarchical zeolites with superior properties for PDH and other catalytic reactions. The potential for hierarchical zeolites to improve the sustainability of catalytic processes by minimizing energy, time, and raw materials consumption is a promising area for future research, aligning with the broader goals of green chemistry and sustainable engineering.

Hierarchical zeolites, by integrating micropores with mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. These materials boost catalytic efficiency by improving metal dispersion and preventing metal aggregation, crucial for PDH reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. Main types include micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites, which offer better reactant accessibility and increased active metal dispersion \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\].

    The integration of intrinsic micropores with mesoporous/macroporous networks in hierarchical zeolites enhances micropore accessibility for PDH reactions without compromising confinement effects \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Synthesis methods include desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, and cotemplating with TPAOH and TBPOH \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. These zeolites offer higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability, boosting propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The hierarchical structure facilitates intermetallic compound formation, enhancing PDH performance and stability \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Higher silanol concentration in hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites results in superior catalytic lifetime \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Enhanced metal-support interactions lead to higher dispersion and electron density over metal sites, improving PDH performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\].

    A novel composite material, TS-1@SBA-16, synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica, combines micropores and mesopores to enhance PDH reaction accessibility \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The 10% TS-1 content catalyst showed peak PDH activity, achieving higher propane conversion than TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\].

    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Hierarchical zeolites, with their unique pore structures, have revolutionized the field of catalysis, particularly in PDH reactions. The synthesis methods, including desilication, self-assembly, and cotemplating, offer versatile routes to tailor the hierarchical structure for optimized performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The enhanced metal-support interactions and the synergistic effect of hierarchical porous structures, suitable acid acidity, and Ti species' electronic effect, as seen in the case of TS-1@SBA-16, highlight the potential for further advancements \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel synthesis strategies to create hierarchical zeolites with tailored pore architectures for specific catalytic applications, including PDH reactions. Additionally, exploring the role of different metal species and their interactions with hierarchical zeolites could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability.
