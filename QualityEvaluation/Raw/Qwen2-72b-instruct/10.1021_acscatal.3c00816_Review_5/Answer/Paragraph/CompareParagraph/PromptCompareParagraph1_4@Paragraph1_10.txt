Hierarchical zeolites, by integrating micropores with mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. These materials boost catalytic efficiency by improving metal dispersion and preventing metal aggregation, crucial for PDH reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. Main types include micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites, which offer better reactant accessibility and increased active metal dispersion \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\].

    The integration of intrinsic micropores with mesoporous/macroporous networks in hierarchical zeolites enhances micropore accessibility for PDH reactions without compromising confinement effects \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Synthesis methods include desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, and cotemplating with TPAOH and TBPOH \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. These zeolites offer higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability, boosting propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The hierarchical structure facilitates intermetallic compound formation, enhancing PDH performance and stability \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Higher silanol concentration in hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites results in superior catalytic lifetime \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Enhanced metal-support interactions lead to higher dispersion and electron density over metal sites, improving PDH performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\].

    A novel composite material, TS-1@SBA-16, synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica, combines micropores and mesopores to enhance PDH reaction accessibility \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The 10% TS-1 content catalyst showed peak PDH activity, achieving higher propane conversion than TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The superior performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to its hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and Ti species' electronic effect, facilitating mass transfer and catalytic efficiency \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\].

    
    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Hierarchical zeolites, with their unique pore structures, have revolutionized the field of catalysis, particularly in PDH reactions. The synthesis methods, including desilication, self-assembly, and cotemplating, offer versatile routes to tailor the hierarchical structure for optimized performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The enhanced metal-support interactions and the synergistic effect of hierarchical porous structures, suitable acid acidity, and Ti species' electronic effect, as seen in the case of TS-1@SBA-16, highlight the potential for further advancements \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel synthesis strategies to create hierarchical zeolites with tailored pore architectures for specific catalytic applications, including PDH reactions. Additionally, exploring the role of different metal species and their interactions with hierarchical zeolites could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
Hierarchical zeolites, characterized by their intricate pore structures that span multiple length scales, have emerged as versatile catalysts in the petrochemical industry, particularly in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials are distinguished by their hierarchical architecture, which combines micropores with meso- or macropores, enhancing their accessibility and reactivity. Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites typically involve templating strategies, using organic or inorganic templates to direct the formation of the secondary porosity. This can be achieved through hydrothermal synthesis, dealumination, or post-synthesis modification techniques. The most common types include ZSM-5, Beta, and SAPO-34, each offering unique properties that can be tailored for specific catalytic applications. In PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene by providing enhanced diffusion pathways for reactants and products, reducing coke formation, and improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the process. Their ability to balance acidity and porosity makes them ideal for managing the trade-off between activity and stability in PDH and other hydrocarbon conversion processes.
