Hierarchical zeolites, by integrating mesopores/macropores with micropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. These materials, characterized by their hierarchical structures, outperform conventional zeolites in reactions involving bulky molecules due to improved metal dispersion and catalytic efficiency \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. The synthesis methods typically involve the use of structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. This design boosts accessibility, reduces metal aggregation, and increases the dispersion of active metal species, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of PDH reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\].

        The main types of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions include mesoporous zeolites synthesized via desilication/self-assembly, 2D/layered zeolites created using bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites utilizing TPAOH/TBPOH cotemplates \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. These materials boost PDH performance by offering higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability, achieving higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The enhanced PDH performance and stability are attributed to the formation of intermetallic compounds and higher silanol concentration in hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. Enhanced metal-support interactions lead to higher dispersion and electron density over metal sites, improving PDH performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\].

        Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include in situ and postsynthetic approaches \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. In situ fabrication involves the use of hard or soft templates during synthesis, while postsynthetic methods involve post-treatment of as-synthesized zeolites \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. These materials improve PDH reaction performance by enhancing mass transport properties, activity, selectivity, and cycle time \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\]. The additional meso- and/or macroporous system significantly improves the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials, resulting in minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption \[10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016\].

        A composite material, TS-1@SBA-16, combining TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica, was synthesized to enhance PDH reaction accessibility \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The 10% TS-1 content catalyst showed peak PDH activity, achieving 54.5% initial propane conversion, outperforming TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. The superior performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to its hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and Ti species' electronic effect \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\].

        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Hierarchical zeolites, with their unique combination of micropores and meso-/macropores, have revolutionized the PDH reaction landscape by enhancing accessibility and catalytic efficiency. The synthesis methods, including in situ and postsynthetic approaches, have opened up new avenues for tailoring zeolite structures to meet specific catalytic demands. The future of PDH catalyst development could focus on the optimization of synthesis conditions to achieve more precise control over the hierarchical structure, aiming for enhanced stability and selectivity. Moreover, the exploration of novel structure directing agents and the development of advanced templating strategies could lead to the creation of hierarchical zeolites with unprecedented properties, potentially unlocking new catalytic applications beyond PDH. The integration of computational methods to predict and design hierarchical zeolites with tailored properties could also be a promising direction for future research.

Hierarchical zeolites, by integrating micropores with mesopores/macropores, significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. These materials boost catalytic efficiency by improving metal dispersion and preventing metal aggregation, crucial for PDH reactions \[10.3390/catal9020174\]. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolites involves structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes \[10.3390/catal9020174\].

    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Hierarchical zeolites, with their unique pore structures, have revolutionized the field of catalysis, particularly in PDH reactions. The synthesis methods, including desilication, self-assembly, and cotemplating, offer versatile routes to tailor the hierarchical structure for optimized performance \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_5\]. The enhanced metal-support interactions and the synergistic effect of hierarchical porous structures, suitable acid acidity, and Ti species' electronic effect, as seen in the case of TS-1@SBA-16, highlight the potential for further advancements \[10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7\]. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel synthesis strategies to create hierarchical zeolites with tailored pore architectures for specific catalytic applications, including PDH reactions. Additionally, exploring the role of different metal species and their interactions with hierarchical zeolites could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability.
