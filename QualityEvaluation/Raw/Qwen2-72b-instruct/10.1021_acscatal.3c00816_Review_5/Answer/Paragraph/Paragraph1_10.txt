Hierarchical zeolites, characterized by their intricate pore structures that span multiple length scales, have emerged as versatile catalysts in the petrochemical industry, particularly in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials are distinguished by their hierarchical architecture, which combines micropores with meso- or macropores, enhancing their accessibility and reactivity. Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites typically involve templating strategies, using organic or inorganic templates to direct the formation of the secondary porosity. This can be achieved through hydrothermal synthesis, dealumination, or post-synthesis modification techniques. The most common types include ZSM-5, Beta, and SAPO-34, each offering unique properties that can be tailored for specific catalytic applications. In PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene by providing enhanced diffusion pathways for reactants and products, reducing coke formation, and improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the process. Their ability to balance acidity and porosity makes them ideal for managing the trade-off between activity and stability in PDH and other hydrocarbon conversion processes.
