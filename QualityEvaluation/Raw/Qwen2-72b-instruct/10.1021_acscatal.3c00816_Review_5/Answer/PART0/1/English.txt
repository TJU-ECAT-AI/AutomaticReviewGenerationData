Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which greatly improves the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites. The main types of these materials include zeolites with hierarchical structures, which have been observed to improve catalytic efficiency in reactions involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization, compared to conventional zeolites. The synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites often involve the use of structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes to create the desired pore structures. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing better accessibility for reactants and products, reducing metal aggregation, and increasing the dispersion of active metal species.

Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, achieving enhanced micropore accessibility without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect. The main types of hierarchical molecular sieves for PDH reactions include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates. These materials improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by possessing higher surface areas, weaker acidity, and improved stability, leading to higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The hierarchical structure also facilitates the formation of intermetallic compounds, which contribute to enhanced PDH performance and stability. The higher silanol concentration in hydrothermal-synthesized hierarchical zeolites results in superior catalytic lifetime. The hierarchical structure also enhances metal-support interactions, leading to higher dispersion and electron density over metal sites, resulting in enhanced PDH performance.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and meso-/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing unimpeded transport paths (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). These materials show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, including PDH. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Synthesis methods include in situ and postsynthetic approaches. The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis. The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure. Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing enhanced mass transport properties, higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time. The additional meso- and/or macroporous system significantly improves the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials, resulting in minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption.

The novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This material combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content showed the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which is higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species.
