Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

1.The novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This material combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The catalyst with a TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion of propane of 54.5%, which is higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species.

1.新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16是通过将TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅包裹而合成的。这种材料结合了微孔和介孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。TS-1含量为10%的催化剂显示出最高的PDH活性，丙烷的初始转化率可达54.5%，高于TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂。Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16的优异催化性能归因于通过分级多孔结构的优异质量传递性能、合适的酸酸度和Ti物种的电子效应的协同作用。
