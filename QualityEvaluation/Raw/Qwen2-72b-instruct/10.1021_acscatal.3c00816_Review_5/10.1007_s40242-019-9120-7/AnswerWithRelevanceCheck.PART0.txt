          [1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
          [2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
          [3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

          The novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This material combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content showed the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which is higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported catalysts. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species.

          新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16是通过将TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅包裹而合成的。这种材料结合了微孔和介孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。含有10% TS-1的催化剂显示出最高的PDH活性，初始丙烷转化率可达54.5%，高于TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂。Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16的优异催化性能归因于分级多孔结构、合适的酸酸度和Ti物种的电子效应的协同作用。
