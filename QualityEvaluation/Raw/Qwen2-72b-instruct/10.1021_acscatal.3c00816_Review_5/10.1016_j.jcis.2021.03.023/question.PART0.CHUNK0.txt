Regular Article Spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites derived from MOFs for direct propane dehydrogenation Abstract The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere. This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C. With intensive characterizations and experiments, it is indicated that the real active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 are isolated CoO sites during the PDH process. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy shows the same intermediate product (Co-C3H7) during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation, indicating that they have a reverse reaction process, and a reaction mechanism for PDH is proposed accordingly.
Graphical abstract Isolated cobalt oxide sites in CoOx@NC/S-1(4) are specifically responsible for propane dehydrogenation, and the reaction mechanism is proposed from in situ FT-IR spectra.

1. Introduction
Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] . Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst [1] ,[2] . However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent.
Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] . In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic [16] ,[17] ,[18] . Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction [19] . Apparently, these catalysts contain multiple active sites, which are not necessarily the ideal active sites for PDH process, especially when the valence state of these nanoclusters changes during the catalytic reaction. Besides, the catalyst containing multiple active centers can easily catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and cracking [13] .
The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed [20] ,[21] ,[22] . Hu et al. synthesized tetrahedral Co2+ supported on silica by grafting CoIII(NH3)6Cl3 from ammonium hydroxide solution, which was highly selective toward propene [23] . Copret et al. prepared isolated cobalt oxide on a silica surface by surface organometallic chemistry method, which also showed high selectivity for propene [24] . However, the propane conversion was severely decreased due to the high surface free energy of the isolated Co sites [23] ,[24] . Since the thermodynamically isolated cobalt oxides are unstable, they would grow during the catalytic reactions (especially at high temperatures). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method that can isolate metal species and protect the isolated metal species to prevent their aggregation effectively.
Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis [25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] . As is well-known, zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which have been considered as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in N-doped carbon by pyrolysis [29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] . In addition, if we can introduce the secondary metal atoms to the ZIFs, the spatial distance between the metal sites can be adjusted due to the coordination environment provided by the organic linker. Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process [33] ,[34] ,[35] ,[36] . Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction.
Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere. The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C. The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultravioletvisible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
All chemicals and materials were received from commercial sources and used without further purification. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole were purchased from Beijing Inno Chem. Co. Al2O3 and SiO2 were obtained from Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd.
Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [37] ,[38] . ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method. Typically, 0.5 g of silicalite-1 was dispersed in 25 mL methanol under agitating and ultrasound conditions to form a milk-white suspension. Then the methanol solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (50 mL, 0.084 M) and methanol solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (50 mL, 0.336 M) were added into the above milk-white mixture under agitating at 25 C for 1 h. Afterwards, the methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole (125 mL, 0.16 M) was added to the above solution and stirred at 25 C for 24 h. The resultant mixture was centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 100 C for 12 h, which was labeled as ZnCo-ZIF/S-1. For reference, ZnCo-ZIF sample was synthesized as similar to the above process without the addition of silicalite-1.
CoOx@NC/S-1 (4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 C for 2 h with a 5 C min1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 C min1. A series of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts with different Zn/Co molar ratios were also synthesized by the same synthetic strategy. Moreover, Co/S-1 sample was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method, as shown in the
