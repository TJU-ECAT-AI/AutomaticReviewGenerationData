Priority Communication Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane: An efficient strategy to enhance stability Highlights • Sn-containing HMS exhibits 40% propane conversion and good stability up to 170 h. • The enhanced stability is due to strong interaction between Sn species and HMS. • The reaction route of propane dehydrogenation over Sn-HMS has been proposed.
Abstract Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. XRD, HRTEM and XPS characterizations jointly evidence that, the Sn species are probably embedded into the lattice of HMS bulk at a relatively low Sn loading amount. Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations. The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate. Further, the reaction route of propane dehydrogenation over Sn-HMS catalyst has been proposed.

Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues. Since 1960s, an abundance of research has been focused on the promoting effects of Sn in Pt-based catalyst. It is widely accepted that, the improved selectivity to olefin and good stability of PtSn catalyst [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] , are mainly attributed to the geometric [5] ,[6] ,[7] and electronic [8] ,[9] ,[10] effects of the introduced Sn.
In peoples traditional understanding, Sn alone is inactive in dehydrogenation reaction [11] ,[12] . Inspiringly, Sn-based catalyst has been proved to be efficient for propane dehydrogenation in our recent work [13] . The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst. However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species. To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably. Herein, the facilely synthesized [14] hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties. The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) [15] ,[16] and short channel length [17] of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K [18] and fast diffusion of products, respectively. Moreover, its weak acidity [19] facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions.In this work, a series of Sn-containing HMS samples with SnO2 content of 2, 5 and 10 wt%, has been synthesized and reduced in H2 flow prior to reaction (experimental details are given in the

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
