The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141 It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C. This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. After an induction time of 1 h, the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (crystallized at 100 C) achieved the best performance giving a propene yield of 60%, equivalent to a STY of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 10).
Similar studies investigating V loading (120 wt%) and its effect on the surface V species present in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts reported a volcano plot-type trend between V loading and catalytic performance, with maximum activity being observed at 12 wt% V loading.132 The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected. In situ DRIFTS analysis elucidated the mechanistic pathway, whereby a vanadium propyl intermediate is formed after propane activation and rapidly transforms to propenyl-vanadium. Propene is formed from propenyl-vanadium or propyl-vanadium and desorbs from the catalyst surface.
Gu et al. reported that P modification could greatly influence the structure and activity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.142 More specifically, P modification decreased the degree of VOx polymerization, which had positive implications on the catalyst stability, as evidenced by the retention of high activity (ca. 45% propane conversion) after an 8 h DDH reaction in all P-modified catalysts. This was almost twice the conversion reached with the unmodified catalyst. The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.
Subsequent studies on a VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction.143 It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits. However, the acidity decreases sharply with excessive Mg addition (above 1 wt%) as the excess MgO covers the surface VOx species, which leads to the loss of DDH activity. The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7).
In addition to alumina, other supports have been investigated. Earlier reports by Ovsitser et al. described a silica supported VOx catalyst which exhibited high propene yield (86%), high stability and minimal deactivation over a 20 h DDH reaction.144 Hu et al. explored vanadium doped porous silica (VSiO2) with varying V:Si mass ratios of vanadium to silicon of 1:24, 1:12, 1:6, and 1:3, respectively.145 The V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C. This was equivalent to a STY of 7.9 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 4). Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles. In common with VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, moderate V loadings were concomitant with increased activity, which was attributed to more vanadium active sites in the channels of the porous silica with increased doping. The moderate vanadium doping level was conducive to highly dispersed vanadium species in the form of isolated and low-polymerized VOx species.
As previously discussed for other DDH catalysts, innovative techniques have also been applied in the preparation of V/SiO2 catalysts. Vanadium-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSNs) exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 18.1% and 91% respectively. The STY was calculated to be 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 8), which is one of the highest VOx containing catalysts reported to date.146 Compared to analogous catalysts synthesized via wet impregnation, the direct co-assembly process for the V-DMSNs catalysts contributed to enhancing the interaction between the V5+ species and the silica support. Highly dispersed and stable VOx species, and an absence of V2O5 crystallites, were conducive to high catalytic activity and stability. When tested for both ODH-O2 and DDH reactions, the V-DMSNs catalysts displayed superior performance, signifying the importance of the preparation conditions and synthesis strategy to form well-defined structure of the support and sufficient concentration of highly dispersed and isolated VO4 active sites.
Hu et al. investigated the influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance.147 Interestingly, enhancement to catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity and yield of propene were observed for VOx/SiO2 catalysts (gelation temperature: 60 C, calcination temperature: 580 C). The VOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibited an initial propane conversion of 55% and stable propene selectivity of ca. 91% over 4 h, with excellent reusability displayed over eight successive reaction-regeneration cycles. The STY was 6.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 5), due to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts.
Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before. Chen et al. synthesized numerous VOx/Si-beta zeolites with various V loadings (in the 0.510 wt% range) with the initial propane conversion shown to linearly increase with the amount of acid sites, Fig. 6.148 This demonstrated the dependency of catalytic activity on total Lewis and Brnsted acid sites generated by VOx on silica, with Brnsted acid sites disappearing after high temperature treatment due to decomposition of hydrated VOx. The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. Thus, only weak and medium strength sites were generated and ascribed to mono- and polymeric VOx species, respectively, both of which aided the adsorption and activation of propane. A correlation between increasing V loading, increased degree of polymerization and a subsequent increase in strong surface acid sites was reported. At 7 wt% VOx/Si-beta, the STY was 4.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 6), which is 56 times less active than the most active VOx catalysts reported to date, suggesting that Si-beta does not facilitate a high concentration of active V sites.

Reproduced from ref. 148 with permission from Elsevier.Alternatively, ZrO2 can be used as a support for VOx. It was found that VOx/ZrO2 is approximately five times more active than VOx/Al2O3 and pure ZrO2, exhibiting a STY of 9.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 2).149 The authors proposed that the enhanced performance of VOx/ZrO2 results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing higher proportions of the active V3+ species. In view of this, Jeon et al. investigated various loadings of V on VOx/ZrO2 catalysts.150 For the most active catalyst, with 8 wt% V loading, the initial yield of propene increased from 24% at 550 C to 28% at 575 C with a negligible (<1%) increase at 600 C. This corresponded to a STY of 24 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 3), which is one of the most active VOx-based catalysts reported. As discussed later in section 4.5, ZrO2 is active by itself and therefore this result likely reflects the contribution from an active ZrO2 support rather than an optimised or improved VOx catalyst. Indeed, the authors alluded to a correlation between activity and the formation of a higher concentration of coordinatively unsaturated (Zrcus) sites, created by the addition of the V dopant into the Zr lattice, increasing the density of Lewis acid sites. As discussed below, the STY of ZrO2 without VOx is actually much higher than in the current work.To date, many studies have investigated VOx-based catalysts, which in some cases have been said to exhibit a catalyst performance similar to that of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. However, comparing the typical STY values for VOx with those of CrOx or Pt, it is clear that the VOx catalysts reported in the literature are not as active as supported CrOx or Pt catalysts. In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species. Of particular importance is the role of the support in altering stabilization and electronic effects of the active sites. Much like the industrial (Pt- and Cr-based) catalysts, the surface acidity and selectivity of the catalyst is affected by the nature of the support. Although the most active V species has been identified, the relative proportion and stability of this surface V species can be tuned by varying the preparation method. On the other hand, the role of the other V species on the DDH reaction remains unclear so further work to elucidate this could yield more active and stable DDH catalysts. The range in performance of V-based catalysts varies quite significantly, with the most active catalysts exhibiting STYs that are around 34 time less active than the most active Pt catalysts.
4.5. Other DDH catalysts
As previously discussed, the industrial application of Pt- and CrOx-catalysts is well established because they offer superior activity, selectivity and stability for the direct dehydrogenation of propane. However, these catalysts are limited in two main areas: economically, by the high cost of Pt and environmentally, by the toxicity of Cr6+ species. Thus, a definite need to develop alternative catalyst formulation exists.
Commonly, coordinatively unsaturated metal cations with neighbouring oxygen vacancies serve as adsorption sites for light alkanes, whereby surface oxygen sites abstract hydrogen from the adsorbed alkane. Armed with this knowledge, researchers continue to focus their efforts on catalyst design with the aim of enhancing dehydrogenation performance, creating both economic and environmental benefits.
Bulk ZrO2, characterized with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus4+) as active sites, has emerged as a highly active and selective unsupported catalyst for the direct dehydrogenation of propane. Kondratenko and co-workers first reported that ZrO2 is active in its own right for DDH and subsequently demonstrated the importance of crystallite size and phase composition in determining activity.151,152 The rate of propene formation was inversely proportional to the crystallite size, but crucially, amorphous ZrO2 was very poorly active. Time on-stream conversions dropped significantly over time due to carbon deposition, but regenerative cycles were completed to examine if the activity could be regained. At 550 C, ZrO2 was durable after 20 cycles but at 600 C the ZrO2 crystallites sintered, causing a loss in activity. The initial performance corresponded to an STY of 64 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 13), which is one of the highest non-Pt values reported.

Jeon et al. reported the modification of ZrO2 with a vanadium dopant that exhibited an initial propene yield of 28%, excellent recyclability over ten cycles with no change in the active sites, and twice the activity observed in bulk un-doped ZrO2.150 This was attributed to an increase in Lewis acidic (Zrcus4+) active sites, that are a consequence of structural transformation. Additionally, the authors discovered that regardless of the vanadium content, all the catalysts exhibited a propene selectivity in excess of 98%.
Similarly, a positive effect from the modification of ZrO2 with a Cu dopant was reported by Jeon et al.153 The optimal CuZrOx catalyst displayed improved activity and selectivity at 600 C compared to conventional (1 wt%) Pt/Al2O3, (0.5 wt% Pt-1.5 wt% Sn) PtSn/Al2O3 and (5 wt% CrOx/Al2O3). The authors established a correlation between the specific activity of CuZrOx catalysts and the number of weak acid sites, resulting from the substitution of Cu in the Zr sub-lattice generating oxygen vacancies and Zrcus4+ ions. The STY of the CuZrOx catalyst was 26 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, compared to 22 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 in the unmodified catalyst (Table 7, entries 9 and 10). While this improvement is promising, the STY was lower than half of an optimised ZrO2 catalyst previously reported in ref. 151, suggesting that there is still room for improvement in the CuZrOx preparation, or that it is possible to promote activity through careful catalyst preparation rather than adding metals.
The concentration of dopant atoms, and the temperature of reduction were other contributing factors that affected the catalytic behaviour for ZrO2-based catalysts.3 Numerous binary YZrOx and LaZrOx-based catalysts displayed high activity, selectivity and stability as well as comparable performance to KCrOx/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of 60 DDH cycles at 550 C, 600 C and 625 C under industrially relevant conditions. The experimental parameters had a beneficial effect on the concentration of Zrcus4+ ions, and the concentration of surface lattice oxygen, which in tandem play an active role in propane activation.
As discussed in the above sections, Zn has been used as a promotor in Cr and Pt catalysts. Sun et al. also investigated it as a promotor for Nb catalysts.154 However, its use as a catalyst in its own right has recently been reported, notably by Yuan and co-workers. It was shown that ZnO nanoclusters supported in dealuminated zeolite-beta exhibited an initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of 53% and 97%, respectively at 600 C. The initial STY was 4.2 molC3H6 kg1cat h1, and the conversion dropped to 40% after 6 h on-stream due to coking. ZnO/H-ZSM-5 was also investigated by the same group and it was shown that high SiO2:Al2O3 ratio supports yielded more selective DDH catalysts.155 The presence of strong acid sites is known to promote coke formation via deep dehydrogenation and therefore this trend is expected. The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 12).
Kondratenko and co-workers reported the activity of ZnO supported on composites of N-doped carbon in silicalite-1.156 Initial propane conversion and propene selectivity of the catalyst was ca. 52% and 89% respectively at. This corresponds to a STY of 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 11). Although the catalyst was active in the absence of the N-doped carbon composite, i.e. ZnO/silicalite-1, the activity was over 3 times lower. The role of the N-doped carbon was to encapsulate the ZnO nanoparticles and maintain high dispersion of the active component.
While the above studies indicated that supported Zn catalysts can be selective DDH catalysts, the STY values were an order of magnitude below typical Pt and CrOx based catalysts. However, this gap in performance was recently closed by Han et al., who investigated a range of Zr-containing metal oxides as supports for Zn, including ZrO2, TiZrOx and CeZrOx (as well as control catalysts without ZrO2 such as Al2O3 and SiO2).157 High catalyst activity was observed when Zr was present in the support, which is expected given that it is active by iteslf.151 However, the origin of the high activity could also be linked to the speciation of Zn. In the most active catalyst, 4 wt% Zn/TiZrOx, the Zn was present exclusively as isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+Ox. This catalyst produced a STY of 55 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 at 550 C (Table 7, entry 2). Long term stability studies over 250 h and 10 regeneration cycles showed that a small drop in propane conversion and no loss in propene selectivity takes place. The drop in propane conversion was confirmed by ICP analysis to be due to loss of Zn from the catalyst. Temporal analysis of products studies were carried out to probe the rate-determining step of the reaction over supported Zn catalysts. Interestingly, it was shown that the formation of H2 was rate-limiting in the catalyst, not CH bond activation. Additionally, the presence of Ti in the catalyst support was shown to promote H2 formation, which suggests that Ti in general is a good choice for a propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The observation that ZnZr catalysed DDH is not limited by CH bond activation is a significant finding. As observed over similar catalysts, the rate of coke formation was dependent on acid and base sites, in this case present on the support. However, the best predictor of coke formation rate was the number of basic sites on the catalyst, which showed a strong positive correlation.
In section 3, the current commercial processes for propane dehydrogenation were presented and discussed. With the exception of the K-PRO process by KBR, all of the commercial catalysts have been disclosed. It is only known that the catalyst does not consist of Pt or Cr. We note that a patent was filed in the US in 2020 by Mukherjee et al. at Exelus, inc. (who developed the catalyst that is licensed to the K-PRO process)158 for alkane dehydrogenation using a catalyst consisting of Zn, Zr and Ti oxides.159 The optimal loadings and formulations disclosed in the patent are very similar to those reported by Han et al.157 and therefore we tentatively suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process is likely to be based on ZnZrTiOx.
Co-Based catalysts have also been demonstrated as potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. Dai et al. reported a Co/Al2O3 catalyst with a high stability and selectivity (>97% propene selectivity), and a corresponding STY of 16 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 4).160 Through extensive characterization it was observed that the Al2O3 sufficiently stabilized isolated Co2+, preventing surface reconstruction of Co species under reaction conditions. As a result, the catalyst efficiently facilitated propene desorption, inhibiting the formation of coke and other by-products. The application of a reductive-reoxidation treatment positively affected dehydrogenation performance of Co/Al2O3 catalysts.161 An initial propene yield of 28% and high selectivity to propene (>93%) was obtained over the course of the reaction. The authors attributed this to increased dispersion of Co metal species, a consequence of the mild reoxidation conditions resulting in markedly smaller (6 nm) Co metal nanoparticles, contrary to those observed in the fresh (34 nm) and reduced counterparts (25 nm).
As an efficient promoter of Pt-based catalysts, Sn was previously thought to be an inactive metal for dehydrogenation reactions. Surprisingly, metallic Sn supported on SiO2 has proven to be an efficient, dehydrogenation catalyst, exhibiting a sustained propene yield of 30% over the course of a 70 h DDH reaction at 600 C.162 The incorporation of a hydrogenation component (Pd) can improve the stability of this catalyst, however, loss of Sn metal under reaction conditions, as a consequence of its low melting point, requires further investigation into more suitable supports than SiO2. Hexagonal mesoporous silicas have emerged as possible candidates due to Sn-HMS exhibiting high propane conversion (ca. 40%) and enhanced stability after multiple oxidative regenerations and 170 h on-stream.163 The improved stabilization is a result of two factors: firstly, Sn incorporation into the lattice of HMS forms strong SnOSi bonds, which inhibit Sn reduction to low melting point Sn0, and secondly, additional stabilization of the Sn species is induced by the mesoporous structure of the HMS support.
Wang et al. revealed the dependency of the nature and distribution of SnOx species on the Sn loading, and through advanced characterization revealed uniform distribution and stabilization of isolated Sn4+ species in fresh samples, whilst being stabilized in the Sn2+ state after reduction on SiO2 due to strong metalsupport interactions.164 Superior long-term stability, as well as recovery of the initial activity upon oxidative regeneration, suggests that these materials could be very promising DDH catalysts.
Pd and Pd3Fe supported on SiO2 exhibited propene yields of 4.5% and 9.4% respectively at 510 C. The bimetallic catalyst exhibited a much higher propene yield than Pd-only, despite both catalysts having a similar average nanoparticle size (ca. 2 nm).165 The STY of the Pd3Fe catalysts was 32 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 1). This was partly due to a geometric effect in the formation of the Pd3Fe alloy nanoparticles, breaking the ensemble of Pd, thus enhancing the selectivity and suppressing structure sensitive CC hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Electronic effects, often thought to promote high selectivity in Pt dehydrogenation catalysts, were not concluded to strongly influence the selectivity of Pd3Fe/SiO2.
Recent advances in catalyst design have yielded non-noble-based intermetallic compound (IMC) catalysts, which present unique surface and catalytic chemistry that may be promising for propene production. He et al. explored highly selective and stable phase-pure Ni3Ga IMC nanoparticles with Ga-rich surfaces supported on Al2O3. These exhibited high selectivity (94%), good stability over long term (82 h) testing and regeneration ability at 600 C, resulting in a STY of 6.1 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 8).166 In order to compare with industrial-type catalysts, PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (CATOFIN) catalysts were prepared and tested under the same reaction conditions. It was shown that the Ni3Ga/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited comparable conversion to PtSn/Al2O3 and inferior conversion to CrOx/Al2O3, although after 14 h on-stream the CrOx/Al2O3 had deactivated to a similar conversion as Ni3Ga/Al2O3. Although the authors claim that Ni3Ga/Al2O3 exhibited comparable performance to the commercial catalysts, there is no indication that the PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared in this work would be as active as the actual commercial catalysts. Furthermore, the STY of all of the catalysts was an order of magnitude below the literature values associated with PtSn and CrOx catalysts (Tables 3 and 4, respectively).
Typically, oxygenic functional groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials, high surface area, stable structure, tuneable nanoscale dimensions and porosity are all important parameters which determine the efficiency of metal free carbon-based dehydrogenation catalysts. The induced activity of the oxygenic functional groups is a consequence of localization of π-electrons from defects, edges and vacancies.167 Meanwhile, their porous structures are key determinants in achieving efficient mass and diffusion transfer.
Hu et al. recently reported the exploitation of biomass-derived porous carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts prepared by a simple alkali (KOH) activation method.168 The carbon catalyst activated with KOH at 700 C exhibited the best catalytic activity, displaying an initial propene yield of 36.6% and a STY of 4.5 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 7). The activity was attributed to the carbon catalysts possessing high surface area, hierarchical porous structure, and abundant oxygenated functional groups. Interestingly, no carbon deposition was observed with a carbon balance of 100% being maintained over 10 h of reaction time, rendering high stability signified by negligible loss in surface area and pore volume.
Recent interest into mesoporous carbons has yielded numerous dehydrogenation catalysts, with the large and well-ordered porosity proving beneficial for mass transport while long term stability (of up to 100 h) has also been shown, which exhibited an STY of 5.7 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 3).169 As discussed above, it has been previously mentioned that coke formed in the DDH reaction can catalyse the reaction itself, so it is expected that carbonaceous catalysts would exhibit some activity. Of course the obvious drawback of such catalysts is the inability to burn off the coke, as would be typically done over mixed metal oxide or supported Pt catalysts in order to regenerate them. Mesoporous carbons prepared via a soft templating method and carbonized at 600 C, 700 C and 800 C were investigated by Hu et al.170 The increase in carbonization temperature positively influenced the propene selectivity of the aforementioned catalysts to 85.6%, 88.7% and 93.5%, respectively. The authors observed tuneable concentrations of the CO, OCO and OH functional groups by adjusting the carbonization temperature. As such, low carbonization temperatures (600 C) enhanced deep cracking due to surface acidic sites (e.g. OCO), hindering propene desorption. The subsequent increase in carbonization temperature (up to 700800 C) caused the decomposition of the acidic sites, thus increasing propene selectivity. Consequently, a linear relationship between the concentration of CO groups and specific activity was established. The application of resorcinol-formaldehyde and Pluronic F127 also induced different pore ordering, with highly ordered mesoporous carbons displaying improved catalytic performance as a result of more accessible active sites and favourable mass transport properties.
Moreover, Pan et al. reported the modification of carbon with phosphorus from various sources, which introduced defects, forming numerous surface functional groups.171 It was found that P modification of mesoporous carbon with triethyl phosphate had a promoting effect relative to (NH4)2HPO4- and H3PO4-modified mesoporous carbon displaying initial propene yields of 27.2%, 18.7% and 17.2%, respectively. The most active catalyst exhibited a STY of 3.4 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 7, entry 6). The improved catalyst performance was attributed to larger specific surface area, pore volumes, and pore sizes, as well as an increased number of carbonyl/quinone groups and a higher degree of graphitization.
There are many non Pt, Cr, Ga and V containing catalysts in the literature that have not been given the same attention as the aforementioned elements. Notable examples include Zn/ZrTiOx and ZrO2, which in terms of STY, outperform many Pt and Cr-based catalysts. These catalysts consist of non-toxic, abundant elements and are good candidates for commercialisation. Based on an analysis of the patent literature and commercial press releases, we suggest that the catalyst in the K-PRO process consists of a mixed metal oxide of Zr, Zn and Ti. Despite very impressive catalyst performance, investigations into Zn and Zr catalysts are very few. In contrast to Pt, Cr, Ga and V catalysts, which have been extensively studied and are fairly well-understood, Zn and Zr catalysts should be studied in greater detail to better understand the active species involved and how the performance can be further improved.
In conclusion, the direct dehydrogenation of propane can be catalysed by a broad range of metal oxides. Pt and Cr-based catalysts constitute the most commonly reported catalysts and are amongst the most active, which is not surprising given that both of these have been implemented in commercial processes. However, improvements in this sub-field of catalyst research has been incremental for some time and it is unlikely that a step-change in activity will be realised by further investigation. In contrast, Zr and Zn based catalysts are relatively immature and there are many opportunities to prepare highly active, stable DDH catalysts using these elements. Despite numerous investigations into coke formation over various catalysts, all DDH catalysts are prone to coking to some extent, and this remains the frontier in DDH catalyst design. More often than not, the origin of coke formation is due to strong acid/base sites on the support, or specific structures of the active component. Careful preparations and appropriate promotors can help to neutralise coke formation, but this can come at the expense of propene selectivity or propane conversion.
5. Oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using oxygen (ODH-O2) is an attractive route to propene due to favourable thermodynamics, theoretically being unlimited and exothermic is highly beneficial for industrial scale-up. Oxygen is cheap and non-toxic, but conditions must be controlled to ensure that the oxygen/propane ratio is not flammable. Regarding safety and industrially relevant processes, if selectivity is improved further for ODH-O2, then the reaction could be an exciting and useful process. In general, productivities are not currently high enough to be of interest for industrial application due to the low selectivity of many metal oxide catalysts, but more recent developments in the field may change this, with boron-based catalysts forming ethene as a secondary product in contrast to COx products over metal oxide catalysts.
ODH-O2 reaction pathways are much simpler than DDH and ODH-CO2, with fewer side reactions and products forming over typical catalysts. Overoxidation is the main limitation in ODH-O2. For metal oxide-based catalysts, gaseous oxygen is utilised via a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, with lattice oxygen abstracting hydrogen from propane. The following section describes the most significant literature reports on catalysts for ODH-O2.
5.1. Vanadia based ODH-O2 catalysts
The first vanadia-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation were VMgO catalysts applied for the ODH-O2 of butane. In 1988, VMgO catalysts were found to be active and selective to propene when compared to V2O5 and MgO.172 Since this early discovery, there have been many investigations into V-based catalysts for ODH-O2, which have focussed on catalyst optimisation as well as understanding the nature of the active site.
Sam et al.173 analysed Mg2V2O7, which in contrast to other VMgO phases tested, contained vanadium species with a VO bond. Mg2V2O7 exhibited a conversion of 6.9% and propene selectivity of 53.5% at 550 C, which was much more productive than Mg2V2O8 and Mg2V2O6. This early work highlighted the importance of the VO bond in producing effective ODH-O2 catalysts. Corma et al. later examined the influence of supports for supported vanadia catalysts.174 It was shown that VO2+ pairs present in V2O5 are active for ODH-O2 but were also the source of overoxidation to COx products. More acidic supports, such as silica, decreased dispersion and therefore more V2O5 was detected, compared to more basic supports such as MgO and TiO2. It was also found that if the VO bonds were adjacent to VO sites, then overoxidation occurred. Limiting the formation of V2O5 and forming VO sites with tetrahedral coordination was found to be crucial to forming a selective catalyst.
Subsequent reviews of the literature by Kung and Kung,175 and Blasco and Lpez Nieto176 further highlighted that VO bonds were the active sites for ODH-O2 in these materials. These reviews have guided modern investigations to focus on preparing isolated V species on metal oxide supports, rather than Mg-containing mixed oxide materials. It was shown that ODH-O2 rates initially increase with VOx surface density but decrease when V2O5 crystallites form at high V loadings, due to agglomeration of particles. It was also found that the formation of V2O5 crystallites significantly reduced the selectivity to propene, as the surface propyl species will react over two V atoms.177 The formation of V2O5 was shown to occur at lower V loadings for more acidic supports, such as SiO2, whilst using a high surface area silicate, MCM-41, was found to maintain a high STY due to a larger area for dispersion.178 A general trend can be shown across the literature in which isolated VO4 species (sometimes denoted as monomolecular or monomeric) are predominant at low vanadium loadings, and as the VOx surface density increases, the predominant V species become V2O7 dimers, forming polymeric vanadia across the surface (also commonly denoted in the literature as polyvanadate, V2O5-like, 2-dimensional or more generally, VOx). With higher V loadings, V2O5 crystallites become present (also denoted as 3-dimensional species), as shown in Fig. 7. This has been shown to be the case for many supports including SBA-15,179 TiO2180 and γ-Al2O3181 Fig. 7 Two dimensional (monomeric and polymeric) and three-dimensional structures for supported metal catalysts. S = support atom, M = support metal.182 The density of isolated V sites can also be influenced by the nature of the support, and some supports can sustain a higher density of isolated V sites compared to others. For example, a higher density of isolated V sites was achieved on SBA-15, when compared to conventional SiO2 and MCM-41, due to a lower surface acidity.183 The loading of vanadia required to sustain only monomeric sites is 89 V nm2 on most supports, with SiO2 showing a maximum loading of 3.3 V nm2 for monomer only coverage.184 SiO2 tends to have a poor interaction with the vanadia precursor species in general due to similarities in the acidity of both, so dispersion of V atoms is lower. Depending on the preparation method, monomolecular or polymeric species can exist with high dispersion, or 3-dimensional V2O5 crystallites can form even below monolayer coverage.
An in-depth review of vanadia based catalysts for ODH-O2 was undertaken by Carrero et al.4 in 2014. The review highlighted that the activity of supported vanadia catalysts can be explained by one scaling parameter: the energy of oxygen defect formation. This in turns defines the reducibility of the site and therefore the redox potential. In practice, the formulation of the oxide support, the V loading (and subsequently, the dispersion and speciation) all affect the final catalyst structure and give rise to the wide-range of performances reported. The review also highlighted the complexity in the relationship between V species and catalytic activity: not all VO4 units are equally active; the local geometry and support affect the reducibility and therefore activity. In fact, the authors concluded that despite many reports in advancing the synthesis of supported VOX catalysts, only a minority of surface species are highly active. Since 2014, several studies have further improved vanadia dispersion and subsequently, the catalyst performance. The most significant advances in this endeavour are discussed below.
The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield. The isolated VOx species present at low V loadings became reduced at a lower temperature compared to polyvanadate species and V2O5, suggesting that isolated species can facilitate oxidation of propane more effectively.185 In contrast, vanadia has been supported on Al2O3 that was doped with varying concentrations of MgO to induce basic site functionality.186 Increasing the Mg content led to a decrease in strong acid sites, decreasing activity, consistent with the fact that strong acid sites can activate propene. An Mg/V ratio of 0.8 showed the highest yield of propene, as the ratio of Mg/V balanced the effects of strong acid sites for propane conversion, whilst limiting overoxidation through the addition of Mg resulting in a change of surface species and acidity. The strength of the VO bond was also influenced by Mg doping, with the binding energy of VO bonds increasing with increasing Mg content. This effect increased selectivity by decreasing overoxidation due to the inhibited lability of lattice oxygen.
Zhang and Liu187 also investigated VMgO catalysts with the aim of increasing the loading whilst maintaining a high level of dispersion on SBA-15, which has previously been show V2O5 crystallite formation even at low loading levels. To limit agglomeration of vanadia, co-impregnation of V and Mg was undertaken which resulted in the suppression of 3D V2O5 crystallite formation. In this investigation, it was shown that with increasing V content, the V environments went from isolated VO4 species to Mg3V2O8, and no crystalline V2O5 was detected, even with V loading levels of 25 wt% when using co-impregnation of V and Mg. The Mg3V2O8 phase was shown to be intrinsically more selective than dispersed VO4, and at 20% propane conversion, propene selectivity was found to be higher for MgVO catalysts, than VO catalysts, with some dependence on crystallite size (a 2030 nm crystallite size gave the highest propene selectivity of 59%). Small Mg3V2O8 crystallites showed preferential kinetics (i.e., a higher rate of propene formation compared to rate of combustion and rate of propene formation) when compared with dispersed VO4 species, since the latter have an increased preference for propene oxidation compared to Mg3V2O8. This is interesting as H2-TPR showed a lower level of reducibility for Mg3V2O8 when compared to VO4 species, suggesting that former catalyst was sufficiently reducible to achieve oxidation of propane, but not to overoxidise to COx products.
Supporting vanadia on SBA-15 via wet impregnation has been explored and a loading of 6.6 wt% V achieved a surface density of 1.6 V nm2, the highest surface density achieved on SBA-15 without V2O5 crystallite formation; coverage was increased by rehydrating the support before impregnation, aiding dispersion.188 The increased dispersion led to an increased selectivity when compared to similar catalysts. Zhu et al. investigated pre-treatment of the support, with the simple idea that modifying the support before loading V could control the dispersion.189 A SiO2 support was treated at different temperatures before grafting VOCl3 onto the surface. Higher temperature treatments (700 C to 1000 C) resulted in the removal of neighbouring silanols and only isolated silanols were detected using IR spectroscopy. Isolated silanols can anchor VOx species, and isolated silanols would be expected to produce monomeric VO4. Due to the silanol site concentration decreasing, the loading of vanadia decreased with increasing support pre-treatment temperature. However, the increase in pre-treatment temperature also led to an increase in monomeric vanadia sites compared to dimeric sites. The catalysts with the highest abundance of isolated monomers showed the highest propene selectivity of 90% at 500 C and 68% at 600 C (Table 8, entry 4), leading to the conclusion that monomeric sites are more selective than the polymeric structure. This study highlighted the difference in selectivity between different VOx species. It must be noted that no 3D V2O5 crystallites were detected when using VOCl3 grafting on heat-treated SiO2 supports, and therefore selectivity to propene was maintained.

To probe the influence of monomer sites, Barman et al.190 grafted monomeric V species onto SiO2 using surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). This approach represents another example of changing the preparation technique to increase dispersion. It was found in this study that monomeric vanadia species are intrinsically more selective. The incipient-wetness impregnation technique formed catalysts which were more selective than SOMC catalysts below 500 C, but above this temperature, the SOMC catalysts exhibited an equivalent or even higher selectivity. A STY of 82 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 6) was measured over V/SiO2 prepared via SOMC.
In addition to high dispersion and control of oxygen environments of the vanadia, tailored support properties are crucial in optimising ODH-CO2 performance. A widely debated topic in catalysis is the effect of support porosity on catalytic properties. The preparation route of Al2O3 was varied to form flower-like, sphere-like and bulk-like morphologies to investigate the influence of varying porosities. Bulk-like morphology only exhibited intraparticle pores, and the monolithic architecture of γ-Al2O3 (formed by a roasting method) achieved the highest productivity for ODH-O2, despite the surface vanadia species being consistent across all architectures, with the degree of polymerisation being fairly similar for all Al2O3 structures as (shown by adsorption edge energy analysis).191 The bulk-like morphology showed a lower resistance to external mass transfer, and reduced the residence time of propene through the catalyst bed, lowering the tendency for further reactions.
Mesoporosity was also explored when forming fibrous vanadia catalysts via electrospinning. A comparison between fibrous catalysts which presented mesoporosity, and particle-like catalysts without apparent mesoporosity, indicated no influence on catalytic performance due to porosity,192 consistent with the aforementioned morphology analysis. However, it is interesting to note that a change in preparation technique changed performance. A one-step synthesis to form VZrOx catalysts was found to form the most active catalyst with 5 wt% V loading, when compared to incipient wetness impregnation catalysts. Incipient wetness impregnation with 5 wt% V loading showed the formation of 3D-V2O5 crystals, known to be detrimental to selectivity, whilst the one-step process did not show evidence of V2O5 formation and improved the dispersion of isolated VOx sites. It is also noteworthy that the VZrOx catalysts from the research by Ternero-Hidalgo et al. operate at a lower temperature, namely 400 C, when compared to other catalysts in the field (Table 8, entry 1) and achieved a STY of 38 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.
Vanadia supported on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (V-DMSN) was formed via a one-step synthesis as DMSN materials were found to have large pore volumes and a larger surface area than conventional mesoporous silica.146 The one step synthesis, similar to the VZrOx catalysts discussed previously, led to higher dispersion and a higher stability of vanadia on the DMSN support when compared to incipient wetness impregnation (denoted V/DMSN). A surface V density of 0.55 V nm2 (2 wt% V), gave the highest STY of 9.1 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 8, entry 5). H2-TPR analysis revealed that the isolated V species were more reducible, which is a strong predicter of activity in ODH-O2.
Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports having been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported. Doping the SiO2 surface with 0.4 wt% Na+ enhanced the V dispersion to a level corresponding to monolayer coverage (i.e., 8.6 V nm2 for 6.2 wt% V loading) (Table 8, entry 2), which is equivalent to many other metal oxide supports.182 It was hypothesised that Na+ ions provide a source of SiONa+ surface species, which facilitate increased monomeric vanadia species, boosting the propane conversion. However, it should be noted that the intrinsic activity of the V/SiO2 catalysts did not increase; the calculated TOFs were similar for V supported on promoted and unpromoted SiO2. Instead, the presence of Na+ simply facilitated a greater density of isolated V sites. The activity of the Na+ promoted V/SiO2 was sustained for 4.5 days and post-reaction Raman spectroscopy showed no formation of 3D V2O5 crystallites. This is an excellent example of doping having a beneficial effect. However, it is sometimes found that doping has deleterious effects on redox properties. For instance, doping with K+ was found to decrease the selectivity and activity when compared to V-only supported catalysts.193 When loaded onto KIT-6 supports, the V began to segregate with the addition of K+ ions because VOx and K+ have a strong interaction, which led to the formation of unselective K+ and V mixed phases such as potassium vanadate. The interaction between K+ and VOx species decreased the reducibility of the catalyst. Interestingly, K+ incorporation led to an increase in the ethene to propane ratio, but the alkene yield was decreased overall. The incorporation of basic metal oxides should be done cautiously, as the benefit of enhanced propene desorption can be outweighed by the detrimental effects on the redox properties of the catalysts.
In conclusion, vanadia catalysts have been extensively investigated for ODH-O2, with the main focus being on maximising the number of isolated vanadia species, which is fundamental to increasing propene selectivity. A more precise view of vanadia species in recent studies has shown isolated vanadia sites to be more selective than polymeric species which contain VOV bridging bonds. Therefore, high activity is associated with high V dispersion. Acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity. More frequently, there are reports of dispersion being influenced by the preparation technique, with grafting vanadia onto the support surface showing promise. However, a one-step synthesis of support and vanadia, in contrast to analogous surface impregnation catalysts, has been shown to improve catalyst productivity. The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies and loadings when compared to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques. Research into one-step synthesis methods is far from exhausted and shows considerable potential for further development. In contrast, incipient-wetness techniques can still be improved, with hydration of the surface or doping being effective strategies. Doping has been shown to influence the intrinsic reactivity of the active sites, but an increase in activity is usually accompanied by a decrease in selectivity. Increasing selectivity via dispersion techniques may be deemed a more promising route to improving catalytic performance. The choice of support material composition and chemical properties is more influential than morphology on overall catalytic performance; many studies comparing mesoporous catalysts with bulk-like morphologies found mesoporosity to have either a detrimental or negligible effect on productivity. Porosity can, however, increase specific surface area and therefore support a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites.
5.2. Boron-based ODH-O2 catalysts
Boron based catalysts are relatively new to the field of dehydrogenation catalysis. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has historically been used a catalyst diluent due to its high thermal stability under oxidative conditions. The 2-D structure of h-BN also allows for high thermal conductivity via efficient phonon transmission across the sheets of BN.195 High thermal conductivity is appealing with regards to industrial application, as this limits the formation of hot spots, and selectivity becomes more controllable. The discovery that h-BN catalyses propane dehydrogenation was first reported in 2016196 and since then there has been significant developments in the understanding of the active centres and reaction mechanisms. In the initial investigation, h-BN (Table 9 entry 8) was observed to catalyse ODH-O2, with similar activity to V/SiO2 catalysts. However, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) displayed higher productivity, selectivity and yield than conventional V-SiO2 catalysts with the BNNT having a STY of 110 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 1), which is 7 times greater than the analogous V/SiO2 materials tested.196Fig. 8 illustrates this difference in performance. In contrast to supported VOx catalysts that produce COx, the major by-product is typically ethene, which is of course more valuable than carbon oxides.

Values next to element/phase represent wt%.
Such a different product distribution hints at a distinct reaction mechanism from other metal oxide ODH-O2 catalysts, and investigations into the reaction mechanism have suggested as much. First order dependence on O2 partial pressure and second order dependence on propane partial pressure was noted by Grant et al.196 It was also suggested that molecular oxygen forms an armchair from B to N at the platelet edges to form a BOON active site, but subsequent studies found catalysts without any N present were also highly active.
Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BN-OH) was subsequently reported to have the highest productivity of any previously reported catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane.197 BN-OH catalysts were also shown to be stable over 300 h on-stream (with no significant reduction or change in selectivity at 530 C). The BN-OH materials were catalytically active after O2 activation, with DFT calculations suggesting that neighbouring B-OH sites formed BOB linkages once both B-OH groups are dehydrated. The sites could be reduced back to BN-OH using steam. Clear discrepancies were seen between previously proposed reaction mechanisms and explanations on how structure influences catalytic activity, showing that in situ edge functionalisation is key to catalytic activity. When comparing supported BN and supported B2O3 on dendritic fibrous nanosilica (termed BN/DFNS and B2O3/DFNS respectively), BN/DFNS showed improved productivity relative to B2O3/DFNS, although both were active.198 This finding is noteworthy, as it shows that BN on the surface can be oxidised to B2O3 during the reaction. The as-prepared BN catalysts however already contained a large proportion of hydroxyl groups, underlining the importance of hydroxylated B in catalysing ODH-O2. This observation is consistent with the activity trends noted for edge-hydroxylated BN (Table 9, entry 2).
Subsequently, the Hermans group probed the influence of heteroatoms on activity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts using a range of metal borides, including B4C, TiB2, elemental B (Table 9, entry 3) and WB amongst others. Elemental boron showed a remarkably high STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1,199 which represented an improved productivity over BN-OH catalysts that had been previously described in the literature. In a subsequent review, it was noted that the propene selectivity was the same at isoconversion for every boron material that was tested,200 suggesting that the boron heteroatom is the source of the active site. Metal borides with a high oxygen and boron surface content showed the highest productivities and the presence of BOx species have been identified as essential for catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of various B compounds depended on the concentration of B at the surface. Under ODH-O2 conditions, the B is oxidised to BOx, which is the active site. It was also shown that the activation of O2 is the rate-limiting step for boron-based catalysts in ODH-O2. These new insights disproved the previously suggested mechanism that required N.
Yan et al. reported that silicon boride was active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane and isobutane.201 At 545 C, SiB6 exhibited a STY of 48 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 7) and subsequent stability tests at 545 C showed that a propane conversion of 20% and propene selectivity of 80% could be maintained over the 100 h experiment.
An extended literature review by Shi et al.5 in 2018 outlined recent advances in testing and further understanding of structureperformance relationships. Key comparisons were drawn between traditional V catalysts and the highly promising B catalysts. In particular, COx selectivity for edge hydroxylated boron catalysts was shown to be 0.5%, in comparison to 1050% for V-based catalysts, whilst productivities for boron catalysts can be maintained for 300 h. Mechanistic studies showed oxygen to have a reaction order of 0.5, suggesting that dissociative adsorption of oxygen is of importance to facilitate the reaction, whilst in the absence of oxygen catalysts had no activity. In situ infrared analysis has demonstrated that the presence of OH groups led to the interaction of molecular oxygen with the surface. Interestingly, alkane partial pressure was shown to have a reaction order of 2,197 with two propane molecules needed during the reduction phase of the redox cycle, to form the two adjacent BN-OH sites in the original catalyst (Fig. 9).

As described above, there are differences in the reaction mechanism between boron-based catalysts when compared to supported metal oxide catalysts. For example, h-BN and other boron-based catalysts do not function for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation,199 whilst metal oxides do function initially and do not require an induction period. This shows that boron-based catalysts form the necessary active sites under reaction conditions, and that the initial catalysts can be perceived as precursors to the active phase. Propane partial pressures exhibit a second order rate dependence for h-BN, whereas in metal oxides it is first order. Metal oxide catalysts such as VOx and MoOx used for ODH-O2 operate using via a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism, whilst h-BN cannot do this due to the absence of lattice oxygen.200 Therefore, in order to optimise boron-based catalysts, a more complete understanding of the reaction mechanism must be developed to tailor the nanostructure to the process.
DFT studies of optimised structures of h-BN have been undertaken to probe the ODH-O2 reaction mechanism. The dissociative O2 adsorption was shown to be favoured on B terminated edges, rather than N terminated edges, leading to B atom terminated platelet edges being more active. DFT calculations also showed that the dehydrogenation reaction at B atom terminated edges is favoured over CC bond breaking due to kinetic and thermodynamicfactors.203 Other DFT studies have built upon the understanding that boron is the active centre for ODH-O2 and suggest that CH abstraction is undertaken by heterolytic cleavage over a BO pair in a BO3 active structure. It has been suggested that O2 abstracts the hydrogen from the newly formed OH group, reducing O2 to HO2, and subsequently forms B-OOH and B-C3H7 on neighbouring BO3 sites. The HO2 group then abstracts hydrogen from the propyl surface intermediate to form propene, whilst H2O2 breaks down to form H2O and the BO3 active site is regenerated.204 Experimental studies comparing h-BN and VOx/Al2O3 once more highlighted the different reaction mechanisms at work. It has been shown h-BN exhibited a C2/C1 product ratio of 2, whilst the VOx catalyst shows almost no C2 products, and complete oxidation to COx dominated.205 This implies that different reaction pathways dominate, with only the first CC bond cleavage being favourable for h-BN catalysts, leaving the methyl group to have many different reaction pathways. Interestingly, an increase in C2H4 selectivity was recorded with increasing temperature. Methyl radicals generated from CC bond cleavage over h-BN catalysts can undergo four secondary reactions which include oxidative coupling of the methyl groups to produce C2 products. The oxidative coupling leads to a better yield of C2 products, whilst other processes such as hydrogenation of methyl to form methane and selective oxidation to CHxOy serve to lower the COx selectivity. Although the study did not undertake extensive surface characterisation techniques, the origin of selectivity is explained and may lead to improving conditions and structural properties by mapping the various reaction pathways. For example, isoconversion studies would extend understanding of the reaction mechanism and form a better comparison between h-BN and VOx/Al2O3.
Advanced characterisation of gas-phase radicals was undertaken by Zhang et al.204 to develop an understanding of reaction pathways of methyl radicals which are formed during CC bond cleavage. Using synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), methyl radicals were detected under reaction conditions (600 C, ODH-O2 conditions with BN treated via gas exfoliation to increase surface area to 72.7 m2 g1). The detection of gas phase methyl radicals linked with the kinetic data showed that methyl radicals contribute to C1 and C2 products. The selective route to propene was expected to be a surface-controlled pathway as no propyl radicals were detected by SVUV-PIMS, despite the group being able to demonstrate a high sensitivity for propyl radicals. Therefore, control of conditions to maximise surface-controlled processes may increase the selectivity to propene and limit C1 and C2 products. Both high surface BN and supported oxidised boron catalysts were tested, with both showing formation of gas-phase radicals.
Venegas et al.206 also highlighted the importance of gas-phase reactions in the reaction mechanism over B-based catalysts and suggested that the propyl radicals are not bound to the surface and react with HOO radicals in the gas-phase. The hypothesis is that if propane reaction pathways were surface-mediated, then similar selectivity-conversion trends to metal oxides would be seen. This is a direct contradiction of the analysis of radicals undertaken using SVUV-PIMS shown previously, which did not detect propyl radicals despite previously showing the capability, and so further elucidation may be needed.
Lu et al. investigated various B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. 10 wt% of B2O3 yielded the highest conversions at 500 C, while conversion drops above this loading.207 The supported boron oxide catalysts showed activity at 405 C, much lower than previous examples of boron-based catalysts. Analysis by 11B NMR detected four different B environments in fresh and spent catalysts: namely B3O9/2 (boroxol ring), BO3/2 (non-ring), tri-coordinated planar B species and tetra-coordinated B species. The latter species were fused into the silica matrix. The presence of boroxol ring and non-ring sites was proposed as the reason for activity at lower temperature, but the data presented does not differentiate between the two. Comparison of fresh and spent catalysts showed an increase in the boroxol ring environment and a decrease in BO3/2. This suggests a structural change due to oxidative conditions, rather than temperature, as the materials were prepared at 700 C.199 Amorphous B(OH)xO3x was identified using 11B solid state NMR, SEM and XAS after h-BN and BNNTs were exposed to ODH-O2 conditions. Boron species with different levels of hydroxylation were detected using 1H11B double resonance experiments208 to show a wide range of oxidation states associated with boron. A range of oxide bridges, hydroxyl and oxide species were present, which result from oxidation and hydrolysis of BN catalysts. The study clearly demonstrates the complexity of these catalysts under ODH-O2 conditions, and that in situ characterisation of the working catalyst is crucial to understanding the reactivity.
Boron oxide was supported on SiO2 to probe how structural control of the surface influences the catalytic performance of boron-containing catalysts. The preparation method employed (calcination of tri-isopropyl borate on an amorphous silica support at 550 C) formed BO3 chains, which cannot be replenished, unlike h-BN and BNNT. The BOx/SiO2 material showed a 10% lower selectivity for a similar conversion when compared to h-BN, but the loading of B was comparatively low, and the bare SiO2 may lower the selectivity.209 Dual or single boron sites were present with varying levels of oxidation and hydroxylation after exposure to ODH-O2 conditions, and the active centre of the catalyst may be one or more of these species. The difficulty in fully understanding the active site in this system is due to the co-existing boron species detected after exposure; BO3 and B-OH have both been implicated but conclusive evidence has not been found. The appearance of metaborate and BO3OH species in the spent catalysts was detected, but there is no data suggesting that these are desirable. It is clear that restructuring of the surface occurs, with a dynamic active site that undertakes ODH-O2. It is also reasonable to expect that a hierarchy of activity exists, where some B species are more active than others, but a multitude of oxidised or hydroxylated boron surface sites can catalyse the reaction. The preparation of single-site boron catalysts would be instructive to understand the active phase.
A h-BN/cordierite monolithic catalyst exhibited a productivity increase of 55% when compared to elemental B. This is among the most active B catalysts reported to date. It was shown that optimising conditions for a high WHSV can lower CO2 selectivity to 0%, which impressive even by the standards of h-BN catalysts.210 It was hypothesised that the high WHSV did not allow for deep oxidation and therefore limited the formation of COx products. The monolith surface was characterised using FT-IR to confirm the presence of BN, but the B speciation was not determined. Wang et al. speculated that the linear channel structure of cordierite allowed for gas-phase radical chemistry to be enhanced and therefore showed improvement over h-BN powders. The h-BN/cordierite material was prepared by the chemical vapour deposition process. The geometry of the support was essential in this case, as well as the support forming strong oxygen bridge bonds with the catalytic phase.
When comparing macroporous BPO4 to bulk BPO4, it was found that the macroporous structure increased the performance significantly. The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6).211 When using the same WHSV, macroporous BPO4 exhibited three-times the conversion of bulk BPO4 despite being tested at a 30 C lower temperature, whilst achieving roughly the same product distribution. The surface area normalised results revealed that both catalysts were equally active, suggesting that the same tri-coordinated BO species is the active, but an increased number of active sites were formed in the macroporous structure. The interconnected macroporous structure was found to achieve outstanding productivity when exposed to a large WHSV by facilitating efficient mass transfer through the catalyst. As macroporous BPO4 and h-BN/cordierite both exhibited a very high STY, it is implied that optimisation of mass transfer via engineering porosity has significant impact on the resulting catalyst. These data suggest that the reaction proceeds in the gas-phase, and as long as it can be rapidly initiated by a large surface area, then a large WHSV will limit surface intermediate contact time, and increase selectivity and turnover frequency.
Overall, it is clear that an important and rapidly developing area of ODH-O2 catalysis is the application of boron-based materials. Many reports corroborate that BO and B-OH species, or a mix between the two (i.e., B(OHx)O3x) are the active sites for h-BN based catalysts. While many reports examine catalyst design, the specific active site and phase is not well understood. This is to be expected with such a new generation of catalysts, but many papers suggesting different active sites and phases of boron exist, resulting in confusion of how to progress with catalyst improvement. Attempts to understand the mechanism have not yet been validated, and a different range of structures have been concluded to be the active sites. Supported catalysts have been formed and show high productivities and potential advancement in the field, but the fundamental understanding of in situ phases and mechanistic processes is still somewhat lacking. It may be beneficial to explore applications of boron-based catalysts in other oxidation reactions and start to build up structureactivity relationships. For example, focussing on bulk and layered materials as well as high surface area materials, may be advantageous in developing an understanding of the intrinsic properties which are desirable when using boron-based catalysts for ODH-O2. Controlling the structure by a consistent synthesis method seems viable, as shown by the formation of nanoporous hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNNS) from amorphous h-BN precursors. The h-BNNS catalysts prepared by Chen et al.212 exhibited a surface area of 347 m2 g1, as well as high purity, high crystallinity and increased thermal stability when compared to the amorphous h-BN materials. The dehydrogenation activity was measured using dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole as the substrate. The h-BNNS catalyst achieved a 34% increase in yield when compared to amorphous h-BN. To build on this, nanoporous h-BNNS could be applied to propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and if this is successful, begin to build structureactivity relationships using these highly crystalline materials.
5.3. Other ODH-O2 catalysts
While the majority of ODH-O2 catalysts are based on BOx or VOx, a multitude of other elements have been demonstrated to be active for ODH-O2. In this section the most significant reports are critically reviewed and compared to the state-of-the-art VOx- and BOx-based ODH-O2 catalysts. Cavani et al. compiled an extensive literature review in 2007, where MoOx-based catalysts were shown to have a lower catalyst performance when compared to analogous vanadia based catalysts for the for ODH-O2 reaction.213 A direct comparison of kinetic parameters for V2O5/Al2O3 and MoO3/Al2O3 in the ODH-O2 reaction showed that vanadia-based catalysts had higher selectivity at isoconversion, and were more reducible than the analogous MoOx-based catalysts.214 The V and Mo catalysed ODH-O2 reaction proceed via similar mechanisms. When comparing V-based catalysts to Mo-based catalysts, both supported on ZrO2, it was found that Mo was less active as the catalyst showed a higher activation energy.215 MoO bonds were found to be active for CH abstraction, with the strength of the MoO bond influencing the activity: the stronger the bond, the lower the activity. Furthermore the strength of the MoO bond was shown to be influenced by MoOx loading. The bridging oxygen bond between Mo and the support was found to be active in the complete combustion of propane.216 The reactivity of MoOM anchoring bonds is influenced by the cation electronegativity in the support material; a low support cation electronegativity leads to increased basicity of the bridging oxygen, and therefore has a higher activity for redox processes.217 Analysing speciation of MoOx on ZrO2 supports found that two dimensional polymolybdate species dominated the surface up to loadings of 5 Mo atoms nm2 and that further increasing Mo concentration led to a lower activity per Mo atom, ascribed to either limiting access to active sites or strengthening of the MoO bond.216 The selectivity of MoOx/ZrO2 can be increased by the addition of alkali metal dopants to reduce Lewis acidity of the Mo6+ centres allowing propene to desorb more effectively, thus decreasing the rate of consecutive oxidation reactions.218 However, the overall performance of the catalyst was lower due to decreased reducibility, which inhibited the Mo6+ centre from undertaking CH abstraction. A typical conversion selectivity trend was seen, where selectivity decreases with an increase in conversion. When MoOx was supported on Al2O3, MoO3 crystallites formed above 4.5 Mo atoms nm2. Below a surface density of 4.5 Mo atoms nm2, the polymolybdate regions were abundant and ODH-O2 rates were high. Above monolayer surface coverage (4.5 Mo atoms nm2), the formation of MoOx crystallites occurred which limited the number of exposed MoO sites. Unlike VOx catalysts where V2O5 crystallites reduce selectivity, the presence of MoO3 crystallites were not detrimental to selectivity, just the intrinsic activity. Bridging oxygen bonds between the support and Mo for both Al2O3 and ZrO2 were found to be active for propane combustion to COx, in a similar manner to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
The above studies of Mo-based catalysts have shown that they are limited when compared to analogous V-based catalysts. A selectivity increase is found for increasing molybdenum loadings up to 10 wt%, indeed suggesting that polymeric MoOx up to monolayer coverage gives the best selectivity. However, selectivity was slightly lower at the same conversion when compared to 2 wt% V catalysts.219 Reports involving Mo containing catalysts often concern mixed metal oxide catalysts containing both V and Mo. When comparing Mo-only to mixed Mo and V oxide catalysts formed via flame spray pyrolysis, a Mo-only loading of 10 wt% on Al2O3 (10Mo/Al2O3) gave a yield of 9.4%, compared to a mixed catalyst containing 4 wt% Mo and 2 wt% V (4Mo2V/Al2O3) reaching a yield of 10% (Table 10, entries 8 and 10). The relative rate of oxidation of propene to COx products, when compared to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, was found to be lower for 4Mo2 V/Al2O3 than 10Mo/Al2O3 between 350500 C. A Mo/V ratio of 2 gave the highest yield for the mixed Mo/V catalysts, and the synergistic nature of the two metals leads to the suppression of overoxidation. This research was limited in that it did not contain any in situ characterisation to probe the synergistic nature of the metal species. Interestingly, V catalysts formed via co-impregnation with Mo exhibited a VO binding energy increase which limited overoxidation as the oxygen became less labile.220 Mo also increased the concentrations of V4+ and V3+species, which are more selective than V5+ entities. The strength of the VO bond can therefore be carefully controlled by level of Mo doping, which may be the origin of synergistic properties which were observed for 4Mo2 V/Al2O3 catalysts.

The value next to element/phase represents wt% loading.
The cycling of Mo-only catalysts has also been explored.221 Interestingly, propene selectivity increased by 15% for the second ODH-O2 phase, at a similar propene conversion, leading to an overall propene yield increase of 5%. In situ XANES showed that the oxidation state of Mo in the second ODH-O2 phase was between +6 and +4 (corresponding tetrahedral and octahedral coordination respectively), with the change from the initial +6 environment happening under the DDH conditions. The distorted structure between +6 and +4 oxidation state of Mo is seemingly more selective than the tetrahedral Mo moieties in the original catalyst. In situ characterisation has thus highlighted a key structureproperty relationship which will be useful in guiding future ODH-O2 catalysts based on Mo.
Mo supported on titanate nanotubes (Mo-TNT) is a rare example of a supported Mo catalyst being developed in recent years. Mo-TNT was explored due to MoOx/TiO2 showing high dispersion,217 an effect that was limited by anatase titania having a low surface area. Doping with K, according to a Mo/K ratio of 10, led to increased dispersion of MoOx across the TNT surface, achieving a conversion of 21.2% and selectivity of 53.3%.222 The increased dispersion caused by doping the titanate with K led to an increase in propene yield by 20% when compared to undoped Mo-TNT catalysts, despite a lower conversion.
Transition metal binary molybdates have also been investigated for ODH-O2 activity. For instance, nickel molybdate catalysts have been shown to be active for ODH-O2.223 Increased selectivity was found to be directly correlated with an increase in Mo/Ni ratio. Further investigation of phases present found that NiO, whilst showing complete conversion, favoured overoxidation, whereas α-NiMoO4 was more active for propane conversion, and β-NiMoO4 was more selective. A Mo/Ni ratio of 0.4 gave the highest propane yield of 15.6% (Table 10, entry 13), which was ascribed to the high ratio of β-NiMoO4/α-NiMoO4, the mesoporous structure and redox properties. Although the activity was identified as being sensitive to the phases present, the underlying properties of each phase were not individually explored.
