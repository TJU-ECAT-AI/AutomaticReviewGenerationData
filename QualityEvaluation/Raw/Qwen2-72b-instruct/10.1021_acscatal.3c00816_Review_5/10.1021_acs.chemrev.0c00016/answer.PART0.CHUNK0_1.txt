1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and meso-/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing unimpeded transport paths (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). The main types of hierarchical zeolites are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Synthesis methods include in situ approaches that create microporous and mesoporous products with or without secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis, and postsynthetic approaches that involve post-treatment of as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure. Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by enhancing mass transport properties, leading to higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time.

1.分层沸石通过提供无障碍的传输路径（大孔）和增强的微孔可及性（介孔），同时不牺牲内在催化活性（微孔），结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性。分层沸石的主要类型是微介孔、微大孔和微介大孔结构的沸石。合成方法包括原位方法，这些方法在沸石合成过程中使用或不使用二次硬模板或软模板来制造微孔和介孔产品，以及后合成方法，涉及对合成的沸石进行后处理以引入分层结构。与传统沸石相比，分层沸石通过增强质量传输性能，提高活性、选择性和循环时间，从而改善PDH反应的性能。
