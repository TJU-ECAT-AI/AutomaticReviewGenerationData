[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion."
[2] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."
[3] "The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites."
[4] "The large variety of synthetic strategies for the construction of pore hierarchy can be divided into in situ and postsynthetic approaches."
[5] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."
[6] "The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites."
[7] "The hard templating route involves the use of either nonporous or porous solid materials with a relatively rigid structure usually used as sacrificial templates to create the additional porosity during zeolite crystallization."
[8] "The soft templating route offers a versatile way to tailor the mesopores."
[9] "The soft templates should (1) be stable in alkaline media even at 140180 C as the zeolite synthesis generally occurs in alkaline conditions, (2) be positively charged to achieve the strong interaction with negative silica species, (3) be of suitable mesoscale sizes in aqueous solution, and (4) be of low cost."
[10] "The main characteristic of the primary methods is one-step synthesis in which all the components are added at the beginning of synthesis."
[11] "The main characteristic of the secondary methods is a two-step synthesis process, in which all the components except the surfactant are added in the first step, while in the second step the soft template can either assist the assembly of zeolite seeds into hierarchically porous structures or form microemulsions/reverse micelles for confined space synthesis/steam-assisted conversion of hierarchically porous zeolites."
[12] "The indirect templating route involves the partial zeolite crystallization of a mesoporous material or the deposition of microporous zeolites onto a mesoporous skeleton."
[13] "The indirect templating method typically produces composites consisting of supported nanosized zeolite crystals."
[14] "The inert supports can only be used as a macroporous template and cannot be used as the initial nutrients."
[15] "The active supports generally contain one or two components, such as silica materials, porous glass, aluminosilicates, and titanosilicates, which might be able to form the building blocks of the zeolite framework."
[16] "The active support can be partially crystallized during the construction of the micro-macropore structures, resulting in the successful incorporation of the active component into the monolith structure."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and meso-/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing unimpeded transport paths (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). This improves performance in a wide range of catalytic reactions.
2.The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those synthesized via in situ and postsynthetic approaches. In situ synthesis creates microporous and mesoporous products with or without templates, while postsynthetic methods involve post-treatment of as-synthesized zeolites to introduce hierarchy.
3.Synthesis methods include hard templating using sacrificial templates and soft templating using stable, positively charged, mesoscale-sized, low-cost templates. Primary methods involve one-step synthesis, while secondary methods use a two-step process.
4.Indirect templating involves partial crystallization of mesoporous materials or deposition of microporous zeolites onto mesoporous skeletons, producing composites with supported nanosized zeolite crystals.
5.Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by providing enhanced accessibility and mass transport properties.

1.层次多孔沸石通过结合微孔和中/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性，提供无阻碍的传输路径（大孔）和增强的微孔可及性（中孔），同时不牺牲其内在的催化活性（微孔）。这在广泛的催化反应中提高了性能。
2.层次沸石的主要类型是通过原位和后合成方法合成的。原位合成在有或没有模板的情况下创建微孔和中孔产品，而后合成方法涉及对合成沸石进行后处理以引入层次结构。
3.合成方法包括使用牺牲模板的硬模板化和使用稳定、带正电、中尺度大小、低成本的模板的软模板化。初级方法涉及一步合成，而次级方法使用两步过程。
4.间接模板化涉及介孔材料的部分结晶或介孔骨架上微孔沸石的沉积，产生具有支撑纳米尺寸沸石晶体的复合材料。
5.与传统沸石相比，层次沸石通过提供增强的可及性和质量传输特性来改善PDH反应的性能。
