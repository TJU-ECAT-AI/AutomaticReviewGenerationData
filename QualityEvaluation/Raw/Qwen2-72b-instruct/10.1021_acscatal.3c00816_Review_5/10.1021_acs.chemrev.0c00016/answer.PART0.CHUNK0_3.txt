[2] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."

[4] "The large variety of synthetic strategies for the construction of pore hierarchy can be divided into in situ and postsynthetic approaches."
[5] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."
[6] "The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites."
[7] "The hard templating route involves the use of either nonporous or porous solid materials with a relatively rigid structure usually used as sacrificial templates to create the additional porosity during zeolite crystallization."
[8] "The soft templating route uses silylated polymers, hydrophilic cationic polymers, cationic organosilanes, and surfactants to create additional porosity."
[9] "The indirect templating route synthesizes hierarchical zeolite materials by partial zeolite crystallization of a mesoporous material or by the deposition of microporous zeolites onto a mesoporous skeleton."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and meso-/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing unimpeded transport paths (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). These materials have great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions.
2.The main types of hierarchical zeolites are created through in situ and postsynthetic approaches. The in situ approach uses hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis, while the postsynthetic approach modifies as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure.
3.Synthesis methods include hard templating using solid materials as sacrificial templates, soft templating using polymers, organosilanes, and surfactants, and indirect templating through partial crystallization or deposition onto mesoporous skeletons.
4.Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by providing enhanced mass transport properties, higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time, as well as improved utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials.

1.分层多孔沸石通过提供无阻碍的传输路径(大孔)和增强的微孔可及性(介孔),同时不牺牲固有的催化活性(微孔),结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性。这些材料在广泛的催化反应中具有巨大潜力。
2.分层沸石的主要类型是通过原位和后合成方法创建的。原位方法在沸石合成过程中使用硬模板或软模板,而后合成方法修改合成沸石以引入分层结构。
3.合成方法包括使用固体材料作为牺牲模板的硬模板化,使用聚合物、有机硅烷和表面活性剂的软模板化,以及通过部分结晶或沉积到介孔骨架上的间接模板化。
4.与传统沸石相比,分层沸石通过提供增强的质量传输性能、更高的活性、选择性和循环时间,以及提高沸石材料的利用效率,改善了PDH反应性能。
