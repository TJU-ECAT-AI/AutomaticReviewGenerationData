[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, FischerTropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion."
[2] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."
[3] "The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites."
[4] "The large variety of synthetic strategies for the construction of pore hierarchy can be divided into in situ and postsynthetic approaches."
[5] "The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis."
[6] "The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites."
[7] "The hard templating route involves the use of either nonporous or porous solid materials with a relatively rigid structure usually used as sacrificial templates to create the additional porosity during zeolite crystallization."
[8] "The soft templating route exhibits inherent flexibility and advantages, such as tunable size and adjustable functionality, and is more versatile than hard templates."
[9] "The soft templates should (1) be stable in alkaline media even at 140180 C as the zeolite synthesis generally occurs in alkaline conditions, (2) be positively charged to achieve the strong interaction with negative silica species, (3) be of suitable mesoscale sizes in aqueous solution, and (4) be of low cost."
[10] "The soft template route offers a versatile way to tailor the mesopores."
[11] "Using this method, either inter- or intracrystalline mesopores can be created in the zeolites by using designed organic molecules, self-organized molecule arrays, or emulsion forming agents."
[12] "The main characteristic of the primary methods is one-step synthesis in which all the components are added at the beginning of synthesis."
[13] "The largest category of soft templates is macromolecular structures, such as soluble nonsurfactant polymers."
[14] "Hydrophilic cationic polymers exhibit a strong interaction with silica-based species due to their high positive charge and high alkali resistance stabilities in the high-temperature process (up to 200 C)."
[15] "The first example of their use as mesopore templates was reported by Xiao et al."
[16] "Nonsurfactant polymers have multiple advantages in synthesizing hierarchical zeolites."
[17] "They have minimized intermolecular interactions, which have little influence on the zeolite crystallization process and thus contribute to the high zeolitic character of the final products."
[18] "Besides, the mutual interpenetration of the polymers and the zeolite crystalline network provides disordered but highly interconnected mesopores within zeolites."
[19] "Thus, nonsurfactant polymers allow for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite single crystals with various compositions and different framework types."
[20] "Moreover, extra functional groups can be added in the polymers to incorporate desired functionalities into hierarchical zeolites."
[21] "The organosilane surfactant has a hydrolysable methoxysilyl moiety connected to a hydrophilic quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic alkyl tail."
[22] "The template 3-(trimethoxysilyl propyl))hexadecyl dimethylammonium chloride ([(CH3O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C16H33]Cl, TPHAC) was added directly to the conventional MFI synthesis gel and then hydrothermally converted to zeolite phase."
[23] "Depending on the different alkyl chain lengths ranging from C12 to C18 in TPHAC, disordered wormholelike mesopores of about 27 nm were created."
[24] "An extension of mesopore size to 24 nm was observed when the synthesis gel was enriched with the triblock copolymer EO20PO70EO20 (poly(ethylene oxide)poly(propylene oxide)poly(ethylene oxide), P123)."
[25] "The organosilane surfactant is also a promising candidate to control the formation of nanosheets, especially for the zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio that are difficult to be prepared by using other types of SDAs."
[26] "The direct synthesis of zeolites with layered structures via the SDA approach is still in an early stage of development."
[27] "Recently, this approach has been employed to prepare hierarchical zeolite nanosheets with MFI and FAU topologies."
[28] "The specially designed amphiphilic organosilane surfactants and nonsurfactant polymers offer precise control over mesoporosity, but they are difficult to synthesize and very expensive."
[29] "Thus, it is still desirable to use conventional cationic surfactants, which are cheap and readily scalable porogens to introduce mesopores into zeolites."
[30] "Due to their excellent mesopore-generating role in the synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials, surfactants are considered as a reasonable template to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites."
[31] "Initial attempts of such approaches were based on the use of mixed templates of monovalent surfactant molecules, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr, mesopore template) and small organic ions, such as tetrapropylammonium (TPA+, micropore template), to simultaneously generate mesoporous and microporous structures in a single zeolite material."
[32] "However, the interaction of the zeolite with monofunctional surfactants (e.g., CTABr) is not strong enough to compete with the zeolite-forming SDA (e.g., TPA+ for MFI zeolite)."
[33] "In most cases, only a physical mixture of bulk zeolite and an amorphous mesoporous material was obtained due to the phase separation caused by the competition between the two different templating systems."
[34] "To improve the interaction between the conventional monovalent cationic surfactants and the negatively charged silica-based species during zeolite synthesis, cosolvents such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) were introduced into the synthesis system, thus facilitating the condensation of the zeolites around the surfactant micelles and resulting in the formation of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites."
[35] "Cotemplates, such as nonionic amphiphilic copolymer F127, sulfonic-acid-ended organosilane, carboxyl-ended organosilane, and amphiphilic organosilane, were added to assist CTABr in synthesizing hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 without the phase separation between the mesoporous phase and microporous zeolite phase."
[36] "The effects of different combinations (different molar ratios) of these two mesogeneous templates (TPOAC/CTABr) on the mesoporosity of the highly siliceous mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were also studied."
[37] "CTABr showed a more effective retarding effect than TPOAC on the nucleation and crystallization of the MFI structure."
[38] "The effect of hydrothermal conditions on the interactions between surfactant molecules and silicate species has been made evident and has been shown to also play a crucial role in the structural transformations of silica precursors."
[39] "The original hexagonal structure of MCM-41 transformed to lamellar and then to the microporous MFI framework as the reaction temperature increased from room temperature to 150 C and then to 165C, respectively."
[40] "Besides, several successful attempts were reported in which microporous zeolites were crystallized at room temperature."
[41] "Thus, the low-temperature crystallization of zeolites in the presence of surfactant micelles seemed to be a possible approach to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites."
[42] "There were a few reports on the synthesis of LTA (Linde type A) zeolite nanocrystals with CTABr."
[43] "In these procedures, the organic surfactant was used as a capping agent to effectively minimize the crystalline size of the zeolite."
[44] "The surfactant prevented further crystal growth by covering nanoparticle surfaces by electrostatic attraction, coordination bonding, or hydrogen bonding, or even using weak van der Waals interaction to the surface atoms."
[45] "The observed hierarchically porous structure in the products followed a two-stage growth mechanism."
[46] "Small zeolite nanoparticles were formed and assembled around the CTABr micelles at the early stage of the gel evolution."
[47] "The slow crystalline rate of the amorphous phase and the low growth rate of the formed crystals kept the CTABr micelles within the crystalline domain during the second stage."
[48] "After template removal, the resultant zeolites exhibited abundant mesopores due to the intercrystalline voids among the aggregated zeolite nanocrystals."
[49] "However, the surfactant capping was not effective enough to generalize the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with other frameworks."
[50] "The difficulties in the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites using the conventional monovalent surfactant as soft templates have been mainly attributed to the weak binding between these monovalent surfactant molecules and silicate species which induces the phase separation."
[51] "To avoid the severe phase separation observed in the synthesis using monovalent surfactants, two-in-one (dual-function) templates have been developed which are surfactant-based."
[52] "The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites using multivalent surfactants has been reported."
[53] "These surfactants directed a periodically ordered mesostructure by the self-assembled supramolecular micelle while micropores were generated by individual surfactant head groups."
[54] "Thus, the surfactants should have a sufficiently strong interaction with the growing zeolite surface to effectively compete with the zeolite SDA to allow for successful dual-template synthesis of hierarchical zeolites."
[55] "Wu et al. synthesized a mesoporous CHA zeolite by using C22H45N+(Me)2C4H8N+(Me)2C4H9 as a mesopore template in a synthesis mixture containing N,N,N-trimethyl-adamantanammonium hydroxide for the micropore formation."
[56] "Jo et al. further synthesized FAU-, MOR-, CHA-, and MFI-type zeolite nanocrystals using the capping effect of the multivalent cationic surfactants in the hydrothermal synthesis conditions."
[57] "The nanocrystals formed due to the stronger and multiple binding effect of the surfactant molecules on the zeolite surfaces when compared with monovalent surfactants."
[58] "The agglomerated zeolite nanocrystals possessed intercrystalline mesopores."
[59] "However, the zeolite morphologies (nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets) and the intrinsic zeolite structures were still controlled by the surfactants."
[60] "The phase separation could be effectively eliminated in the synthesis using dual-function templates."
[61] "However, there are still two major processes which are neither thermodynamically nor kinetically compatible: the condensation of aluminosilicates that forms the micropores and the assembly of surfactants that creates mesopores."
[62] "The mesopores induce great strains inside zeolite structures."
[63] "A supramolecular self-assembled mesoscale structure forms rapidly while the zeolites crystallize slowly."
[64] "Therefore, it is quite difficult to simultaneously realize the long-range order of both micropores and mesopores."
[65] "Surfactant-based templates create the ordered mesopores within zeolites at the cost of the crystallinity of the zeolite structure."
[66] "Consequently, most developed zeolites possessed a lamellar structure with alternated two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets."
[67] "For those two-dimensional zeolites (2D zeolites) constructed by nanosheets or nanosheet assemblies, the third dimension is limited to 23 nm, that is, a 12 unit cell."
[68] "They exhibited large intersheet mesopore volume, high external surface area, open porous structures, and a large number of exposed acidic or catalytic sites when compared with conventional three-dimensional zeolites."
[69] "Long-chain alkyl-quaternary ammonium molecules are usually used to synthesize mesoporous silica materials due to the strong interactions between quaternary ammonium species with the inorganic frameworks."
[70] "Choi et al. were the first to succeed in synthesizing lamellar mesostructured zeolites with dual-function surfactants (C22H45N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C6H13, C22-6-6)."
[71] "The ammonium head groups induced the conversion of the amorphous silica precursor to the microporous crystalline zeolitic framework while the self-assembled surfactant tails directed the zeolite crystal morphology into the formation of a lamellar mesostructure."
[72] "Based on the synthesis condition, the MFI zeolite nanosheets could be obtained in the form of multilamellar stacked MFI nanosheets or unilamellar MFI nanosheets."
[73] "For these multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets, the samples were arranged in a regular way along b-axis, resulting in the formation of uniform mesopores between neighboring nanosheets."
[74] "However, the ordered mesopores disappeared after calcination."
[75] "An effective approach to inhibit the collapse of MFI zeolite layers is to introduce silica pillars in the interlayer space to maintain the ordered mesoporous structure of multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets."
[76] "After the success of the C22-6-6 dual-functional surfactant, Ryoo and co-workers extended the synthesis strategy to various zeolite structures (MFI, BEA, MRE, and MTW) in the form of nanosheets or nanosponges by varying the localized SDA groups in surfactant molecules and mesoporous structures."
[77] "A series of Gemini-type multiammonium surfactants were synthesized and used as structure-directing agents (SDAs) for ordered mesoporous molecular sieves with a crystalline microporous structure."
[78] "For example, a triquaternary ammonium surfactant C18H37N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C6H12N+(CH3)2C18H37 (18-N3-18) generated a hexagonally ordered mesoporous molecular sieve that possessed crystalline walls."
[79] "The multicationic fractions in the surfactant generated the micropores."
[80] "Contrarily, the resultant zeolite Beta nanocrystals aggregated in a disordered arrangement when the micropore porogenic part in the surfactants is replaced by a phenyl group, as reported in the synthesis of disordered mesoporous molecular sieves like KIT-1."
[81] "Besides, the average thickness of the framework is directly decided by the quantities of the ammonium groups in the surfactant."
[82] "More ammonium groups led to thicker walls."
[83] "Moreover, the mesopore size was tunable from 3.8 to 21 nm by using 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB) as a micelle-swelling agent."
[84] "Recently, Xu et al. reported that aromatic groups introduced into the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant molecules not only provide ππ interactions that could stabilize the lamellar micelle but also adjust their configuration to geometrically match the MFI zeolitic framework."
[85] "It was found that the dual stabilization effects made by multiple positively charged ammonium heads and the strong ππ interactions in the surfactant template energetically favored the formation of an MFI zeolite framework with a 90 rotational structure."
[86] "The resulting zeolite nanosheets had a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure, in which the primary microporosity formed in the MFI nanosheet and the secondary mesopores in the 90 rotational boundary, and the tertiary macropores were constructed by the mutual pillaring between the plates."
[87] "A theoretical analysis further confirmed that the coexistence of multiple quaternary ammonium heads and aromatic group tails in one surfactant molecule would significantly reduce the binding energies for mesostructured zeolites."
[88] "Furthermore, they realized the cylindrical assembly of surfactants by introducing azobenzene into the hydrophobic tail of a surfactant with a diquaternary ammonium head group."
[89] "This allowed the formation of ordered mesoporous MFI zeolite with an ordered two-dimensional square mesostructure."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and meso/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing unimpeded transport paths (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores). These materials show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, including PDH.
2.The main types of hierarchical zeolites are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Synthesis methods include in situ and postsynthetic approaches. The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis. The postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure.
3.Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing enhanced mass transport properties, higher activity, selectivity, and cycle time. The additional meso- and/or macroporous system significantly improves the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials, resulting in minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption.
