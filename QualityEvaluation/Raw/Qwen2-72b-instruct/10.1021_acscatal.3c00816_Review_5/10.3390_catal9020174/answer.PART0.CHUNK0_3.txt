[1] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]. However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]. With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which greatly improves the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites. The main types of these materials include zeolites with hierarchical structures, which have been observed to improve catalytic efficiency in some reactions involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization, compared to conventional zeolites. The synthesis methods of these materials often involve the use of structure directing agents and high-temperature crystallization processes. Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing better accessibility for reactants and products, reducing metal aggregation, and increasing the dispersion of metal species.

1.分层沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性，这大大提高了金属物种的分散性，因为缺陷位点的数量大幅增加。这些材料的主要类型包括具有分层结构的沸石，这些沸石在涉及大分子的一些反应中，如异构化、芳构化和加氢脱硫，与传统沸石相比，观察到催化效率的提高。这些材料的合成方法通常涉及结构导向剂的使用和高温结晶过程。与传统沸石相比，分层沸石通过为反应物和产物提供更好的可及性、减少金属聚集和增加金属物种的分散性，提高了PDH反应的性能。
