[1] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]. However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]. With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which greatly improves the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites. The main types of these materials include zeolites with hierarchical structures, which have been observed to improve catalytic efficiency in reactions involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization, compared to conventional zeolites. The synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites involve the introduction of mesoporous structures into microporous zeolites, which can prevent metal aggregation and improve the dispersion of metal species.

1.分层沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统，结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性，这大大提高了金属物种的分散性，因为缺陷位点的数量大幅增加。这些材料的主要类型包括具有分层结构的沸石，与传统沸石相比，人们观察到在涉及大分子的反应中，如氢异构化、芳构化和加氢脱硫，催化效率有所提高。分层沸石的合成方法涉及在微孔沸石中引入介孔结构，这可以防止金属聚集，提高金属物种的分散性。
