[1] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]. However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]. To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]. With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."

1.Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network, which greatly improves the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites. The main types of these materials include zeolites with hierarchical structures, which have been observed to improve catalytic efficiency in reactions involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization, compared to conventional zeolites. The synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites involve the creation of additional porosity in the zeolite framework, which can be achieved through various techniques such as the use of structure-directing agents, secondary synthesis, and post-synthesis modification. These hierarchical structures improve the performance of PDH reactions by providing better accessibility for reactants and products, reducing the diffusion limitations, and enhancing the dispersion of active metal species, leading to higher catalytic activity and selectivity.

1.分层沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统，由于大量增加的缺陷位点，极大地提高了金属物种的分散，从而增强了PDH反应的可及性。这些材料的主要类型包括具有分层结构的沸石，与传统沸石相比，这些沸石在涉及大分子的反应中，如氢异构化、芳构化和加氢脱硫，观察到催化效率的提高。分层沸石的合成方法涉及在沸石框架中创建额外的孔隙性，这可以通过各种技术实现，如使用结构导向剂、二次合成和后合成改性。这些分层结构通过为反应物和产物提供更好的可及性、减少扩散限制和增强活性金属物种的分散，提高了PDH反应的性能，从而导致更高的催化活性和选择性。
