1.The literature does not provide specific details on how hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. However, it does mention that hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition, and that the presence of mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 is helpful for accelerating the diffusion rate, allowing propane to easily access the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which enhances propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal becomes fast, leading to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation.

1.文献没有提供关于分级沸石如何结合微孔和介孔/大孔以增强PDH反应的可及性，这些材料的主要类型和合成方法，以及它们与传统沸石相比如何提高PDH反应性能的具体细节。但是，它确实提到分级ZSM-5是通过在温和条件下用NaOH溶液处理ZSM-5合成的，而且分级ZSM-5中存在介孔有助于加速扩散速率，使丙烷能够轻松接触PtSn颗粒进行脱氢反应，从而提高丙烷转化率。此外，丙烯从沸石晶体中的扩散速率加快，导致裂解反应和焦炭形成的减少。
