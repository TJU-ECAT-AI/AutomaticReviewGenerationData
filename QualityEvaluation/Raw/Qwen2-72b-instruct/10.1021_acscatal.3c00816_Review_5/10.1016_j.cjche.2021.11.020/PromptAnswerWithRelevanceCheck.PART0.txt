Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide specific details on how hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. However, it does mention that hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition, and that the presence of mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 is helpful for accelerating the diffusion rate, allowing propane to easily access the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which enhances propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal becomes fast, leading to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation.
