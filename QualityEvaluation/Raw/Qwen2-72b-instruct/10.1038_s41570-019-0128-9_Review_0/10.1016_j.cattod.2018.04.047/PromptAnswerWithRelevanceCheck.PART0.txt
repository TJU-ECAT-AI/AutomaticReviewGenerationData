How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

1.The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them. The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions. On CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions. The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species. CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH. Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/ and dry-reforming reactions.

1.载体的性质影响铬物种的氧化态,以及催化剂的活性和稳定性。CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2在乙烷氧化脱氢中表现出较高的活性,但在它们上面的反应途径不同。CrOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的主要途径是伴随RWGS的直接脱氢(DDH)乙烷,裂解和焦炭形成作为副反应。在CrOx/ZrO2上,乙烯通过选择性氧化脱氢形成,副反应是非选择性氧化或/和干重整反应。CrOx/ZrO2在高温下快速失活是由催化剂可能的烧结和/或非活性铬物种的形成引起的。CrOx/CeO2是活性较低,但最稳定的催化剂,由于形成在DDH中不活跃的α-Cr2O3相。这个催化剂上的选择性ODH的小贡献与CO2表面再氧化的困难有关。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2的相对高稳定性是由它们对乙烯形成的低活性和由于载体的基本位点而去除碳沉积物引起的。CrOx/CeO2和CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2的副反应类似于CrOx/ZrO2,即非选择性氧化或/和干重整反应。
