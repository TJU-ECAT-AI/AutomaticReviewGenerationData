1. Introduction
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane by O2 to eth- ylene was an important process as an alternation to ther- mal cracking of ethane. However, the challenge of this reaction was to avoid over-oxidation in order to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene. In the last decade, the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide has received much attention. This reaction exhibited obvious advantage compared to the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with O2, which had been demonstrated by many researchers [1 4]. Up to now, metal oxides [1,5], KCrMn/SiO2 [6,7], Cr/ SiO2 [3,8], Ga/TiO2 [9,10], Cr/diamond [11], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [4], CaOCeO2 [2,12], FeMn/Si-2 [13] and Mo2C/SiO2 [14] catalysts have been used to the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts, Cr-based catalysts showed excellent performances for this reaction,especially Cr/SiO2 catalyst. In order to obtain better cata- lytic activities, some work had been carried out on the modification of Cr/SiO2 using alkali metal oxides and sul- fate [8,15].
TS-1, a typical redox molecular sieve, have been widely used to the epoxidation of olefin, which also can be served as a support. Au/TS-1 [16], Nb2O5/TS-1 [17] and Ag/TS-1 [18] catalysts have been prepared and used to various organic reactions, such as propylene epoxidation and syn- thesis of diols. However, few work concerned the prepara- tion and application of Cr/TS-1 catalyst. Weckhuysen et al. had ever investigated the Cr/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting that the addition of submonolayer quantities of surface titania species to silica (CabOSil) can enhance the concentration of surface polychromate species and result in comparable amounts of surface monochromate and polychromate spe- cies [19]. Therefore, Cr/TS-1 catalyst could exhibit particu- lar catalytic properties for the dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide compared to Cr/SiO2 catalyst.
In the present paper, a series of Cr/TS-1 catalysts have been prepared, and the chemical and structural properties of these catalysts have been characterized and these results 1566-7367/$ - see front matter  2006 Elsevier B.V.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
TS-1 supports were synthesized according to the proce- dures described in the literature [20]. The hydrothermal synthesis of TS-1 molecular sieves with various Ti content was carried out using gels of the following composition:
30TEOS:15TPAOH:xTNBT:28.5IPA:2H3PO4:750H2O
(x = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2) with tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide employed as the organic template. In a typical preparation,21 g tetraethyl orthosilicate (Aldrich, 99.9%) was added to
50.8 g tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide (Aldrich, 20% aq.
solution) under vigorous stirring for 2 h. Then a solution containing 1.13 g tetra n-butyl titanate (Aldrich, 98%) and 5.7 g dry isopropanol (AcrosOrganics, 99%) was added slowly to the above clear solution under vigorous stirring.
Stirring was continued for another 30 min before adding to it a solution of 0.77 g H3PO4 in 4.4 ml water very slowly under vigorous stirring, which was continued for another hour. The resultant clear homogeneous reaction mixture was charged into a stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 C for 7 h under static conditions to induce crystalliza- tion. The solid was collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly first with deionized water, then with an acid solution (containing 2 wt% H2SO4 and 5 wt% H2O2) and again with deionized water, dried at 120 C and calcined at 540 C in air for 16 h.
A series of chromium catalysts supported on TS-1 molecular sieves with different nSi/nTi (nSi/nTi = 15, 30,60, 150) were prepared by impregnating a solution with appropriate weights of chromium nitrate onto a TS-1 under air conditions for 10 h, then the slurry was dried at 120 C for 6 h. After being calcinated at 450 C for 6 h,the catalysts were cooled to room temperature, crushed and sieved into granules of 2645 mesh for the ethane dehydrogenation reaction tests. The Cr content was 6 wt% for all the catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max-2400 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. BET surface areas of the support and catalysts were determined by nitro- gen adsorption at 196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 instrument, after outgassing the catalysts at 200 C and 102 Pa over night. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with a Physical Electronics 5702 instrument provided with a multi-channel hemispherical electron analyzer, the band-pass energy being 29.35 eV.
The pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained below
1.3 · 107 Pa during data acquisition. The binding energies
(BE) were obtained with 0.125 eV accuracy and charge compensation was done with the adventitious C1s peak at
248.6 eV.
Temperature programmed reduction
(TPR)
experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor loaded with 0.05 g samples. The samples were reduced in 10% H2/ Ar flow at a rate of 30 ml/min from ambient temperature to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. Before TPR the samples were pretreated under Ar gas flow of 30 ml/min to 300 C at a heating rate of 5 C/min and then further trea- ted at the same temperature for 30 min. The concentrations of H2 were determined by a GC-7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD. To calibrate the amount of H2 con- sumption, the CuO powder supplied by Merck was used.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide was carried out using a fixed bed flow-type quartz reactor (i.d.,8 mm · 180 mm) at atmosphere pressure. 400 mg of a cat- alyst, 12 ml/min C2H6 and 48 ml/min of CO2 (or 12 ml/ min C2H6 and 48 ml/min of N2) were introduced. The products (CO, CH4, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6) were analyzed with on-line
GC-7890
gas chromatograph (TianMei, ShangHai, China) equipped with a 3 mm · 3 m stainless steel column packed with Poropak Q using H2 as a carrier gas. An analysis of H2 was carried out with an offline GC- 7890 gas chromatograph
(TCD
detector) with a 3 mm · 3 m stainless steel column packed with a 5 A
molecular sieve with an Ar carrier. Blank tests were con- ducted under the same conditions, by replacing the catalyst with quartz sand particles of the same size. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: C2H6 conversion  1  2  nC2H6=2  nC2H6 2  nC2H4  nCH4 CO2 conversion  1  nCO2=nCO2  nCO C2H4 selectivity  2  nC2H4=2  nC2H4  nCH4 The calculations do not consider the conversion of ethane to coke, as its instantaneous formation is time dependent and difficult to estimate. All the experimental data were corrected after the reaction for 0.5 h. Moreover, the reac- tion data in the work were reproducible with a precision of less than 5%.
3. Results and discussion
BET surface areas of the support and supported chro- mium catalysts were listed in Table 1. It was seen that TS-1(30) showed the highest surface area among all the cat- alysts, followed by Cr/TS-1(150), Cr/TS-1(60), Cr/TS- 1(30) and Cr/TS-1(15). On the other hand, we can see that the surface area of the Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst reduced at a large extent after the impregnation of chromium nitrate.
This might be due to the blocking of pores.
The XRD patterns of the six samples (Fig. 1af) clearly revealed that these samples contained framework struc- 634

tures of the MFI type zeolite [21]. For Cr/TS-1(30), the structure of TS-1(30) was not strongly affected by the pres- ence of impregnated chromium. The XRD patterns of Cr/
TS-1(150),
Cr/TS-1(60), Cr/TS-1(30) and Cr/TS-1(15) (Fig. 1ad) showed that no diffraction lines attributed to crystallite phase of the chromium oxide presented, indicat- ing that the chromium species were probably highly dis- persed on the TS-1 supports. However, for Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst, the peaks at 2h = 33.5, 36.2, 41.4, 50.2, 54.8,
63.5, and 65.1, corresponding to the diffractions of (104),
(110), (113), (024), (116), (214), and (300) of Cr2O3 were observed after the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide.
The surface concentrations of Cr species determined by XPS measurements were given in Table 2 and Cr2p spectra were shown in Fig. 2. It was seen from the table that the surface concentration of Cr on Cr/TS-1(30) and Cr/TS- 1(150) showed small difference, moreover, their XPS spec- tra appeared somewhat different. The peaks in Cr/TS- 1(150) spectrum exhibited a shift to lower binding energy.
Two Cr species can be found by curve fitting and they were assigned to Cr3+ (peaks A and C) and Cr6+ (peaks B and D), whose binding energies (BE) were given in Table 2 [2224]. The ratios of the two Cr species on the two cata- lysts also show different values. On the surface of Cr/TS- 1(150) catalyst, the ratio of Cr6+ was high.
Fig. 3 presented the TPR curves of Cr/TS-1 catalysts,together with the profile of TS-1(15) support for compari- son.Only one small reduction peak attributed to Ti4+ was observed for TS-1(15) while two reduction peaks in the TPR profiles of those Cr/TS-1 catalysts (Fig. 3be). There- fore the reduction peaks of these Cr-containing catalysts must be related with the presence of reducible chromium species. The assignment of the first reduction peak was quite complicated for the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts (Fig. 3be). It was noticeable that the shape of the first reduction peak of Cr/TS-1(15) catalyst was very irregular.
Based on the TPR curve of TS-1(15), we considered that this peak could contain two reduction steps by curve fit- ting. The first step at 280 C was due to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ because of interaction with chromium. The second step at 320 C was due to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr5+ because of its interaction with titanium [25,26].
However, for other three catalysts (Fig. 3ce), the first reduction peak observed at 310355 C could be attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. The peak assigned to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, appearing in the profile of Cr/ TS-1(15) catalyst, was not detected in the profiles of Cr/ TS-1(30), Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150).

635 content could be responsible for the absence of the reduc- tion peak of Ti4+ in the three catalysts (Fig. 3ce). On the other hand, the assignment of the second reduction peak was relatively simple for the group of Cr/TS-1 cata- lysts (Fig. 3be), this peak observed at higher temperature (400435 C) was assigned to the reduction of Cr6+strongly interacting with the supports to Cr3+ [25,26].
3.1. Catalytic data
Table 3 lists the results of homogeneous reaction between ethane and CO2. It was seen that this reaction could not be carried out at 600 C. When the reaction tem- perature was above 650 C ethane conversion and ethylene yield significantly increased with the increasing tempera- ture. On the other hand, CO2 conversion was zero and CO was not detected in the whole range of temperatures studied. Therefore, the homogeneous reaction of ethane and CO2 was mainly an ethane dehydrogenation, as ethyl- ene was a primary product (selectivity above 91.0%) and a minor amount of methane was a secondary product pro- duced by thermal cracking of ethane at the higher temper- atures.
These results were consistent with those of literatures [12,27]. In the present paper, we restricted the reaction temperature below 650 C. Under this reaction condition, the homogeneous reaction between ethane and CO2 was negligible.
Dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Cr/TS-1 catalysts with different nSi/nTi (nSi/nTi = 15, 30, 60, 150) in the presence or absence of CO2 was investigated at 650 C. The result was given in Table 4. The TS-1(15) support were inactive;therefore the observed catalytic activity of chromium-con- taining solids must be associated with the presence of chro- mium species. The major product was C2H4, and the minor products were CH4, CO, H2 and H2O in the presence of
CO2. Above products were also detected except for CO

and H2O in the absence of CO2. Whereas, O-containing organic compounds were not detected on both cases. In contrast, the Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30), whose supports have the same crystal structure as that in Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150), were not as active as Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/ TS-1(150) in the presence or absence of CO2. The order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS- 1(150)  Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30)  Cr/TS-1(15).
This result suggested that it was the compositions of TS-1 sup- ports affected the activities of the above catalysts. Many researchers had investigated the dehydrogenation of light alkane in the presence or absence of CO2 over Cr-based catalysts [38,11,28,29]. A redox mechanism was suggested in the presence of CO2 [3,68,11,29]. Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher cata- lytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane [4,29]. In our case, TPR results showed that the interaction of high-valence chromium species with the supports over Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150) catalysts was relatively weaker compared to that of Cr/TS-1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30) catalysts, which can well account for their different initial catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of ethane. XPS results demonstrated that there was no significant differ- ence of chromium content on Cr/TS-1(30) and Cr/TS- 1(150). However, Cr6+/Cr3+ was higher on Cr/TS-1(150) catalyst. This was believed to increase the redox potential and had been reflected in the TPR profile. It was the higher redox potential of Cr/TS-1(150) that determined higher activities of this catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane.
On the other hand, the catalytic performances of the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts in the presence of CO2were slightly higher than that without CO2, indicating the promoting effects of CO2 on the ethylene yields. The role of CO2in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the group of Cr/TS-1 catalysts was as yet unclear. In the presence of CO2, consid- erable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, demonstrating the occurrence of a reaction between CO2 and H2 (water gas shift reaction). Removal of deposited carbon through the Boudouard reaction was another plausible cause. Water gas shift reaction could shift the dehydrogenation of ethane to product side, thus leading to the higher C2H6 conversion over these catalysts.
Moreover, CO2 could have the function maintaining chro- mium oxide in higher oxidation states [4,29,30].
The variation of the ethane conversion as a function of the reaction temperature of chromium supported TS-1 cat- alysts (Fig. 4) revealed that the ethane conversion depended on the supports, and for each catalyst increased with increasing reaction temperature. Among the four cat- alysts, Cr/TS-1 (150) catalyst exhibited the maximum value of conversion in the whole range of temperatures studied.
The variation of the selectivity to ethylene with the reac- tion temperature can be observed in Fig. 5. It was seen that with increasing reaction temperature the selectivity to eth- ylene decreased for all the catalysts, clearly indicating that the higher the temperature the higher the rates of second- ary reactions, in which the formation of CH4 took place.
Chromium oxide with high oxidation states was considered the main species resulting in the cracking process of ethane to methane [31]. On the other hand, we can see that the four catalysts exhibited similar selectivity towards ethylene at lower temperatures (below 500 C), whereas, Cr/TS- 1(15) and Cr/TS-1(30) catalysts showed higher ethylene selectivity compared to Cr/TS-1(60) and Cr/TS-1(150) at higher temperatures (over 500 C). In the case of Cr/TS-1 catalysts system, we believed that the difference of ethylene selectivity was closely related with their different redox properties, which had been reflected in the TPR profiles.

637 that the conversion of ethane gradually decreased with the increase of reaction time, indicating a deactivation of the catalyst, which could be associated with the reduction of an active chromium species [29]. The appearance of the less active chromium oxide crystallite in the XRD pattern of the Cr/TS-1(30) catalyst after the dehydrogenation reac- tion of ethane (Fig. 1e) indirectly indicated the reduction of the active chromium species, which can well account for the deactivation of this catalyst. After the reaction for 3 h, the gas flow of the mixture of ethane and carbon diox- ide was stopped and replaced by the gas flow of O2 at a rate of 50 mlmin1. After the treatment with O2 for 3 h, replac- ing the gas flow with a mixture of ethane and carbon diox- ide, then the reaction was again started. The activity of Cr/ TS-1(30) was recovered as seen by the fact that ethane con- version returned to the original value. Moreover, CO2 con- version slightly increased, and selectivity to ethylene decreased at a small extent compared to its incipient value.
When the catalyst was again put under the reaction condi- tions after the O2 treatment, the conversion of C2H6 decreased in an almost similar way to the first reaction step.
This result was consistent with that of the literature [29].
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the groups of Cr/TS-1 catalysts behaved as highly active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane by carbon dioxide. This behavior was a consequence of the exis- tence of reducible chromium species. At 650 C the order of activities of the above catalysts was as follows: Cr/TS- 1(150)  Cr/TS-1(60) > Cr/TS-1(30)  Cr/TS-1(15).
The order of ethylene selectivity was in opposition to that of activities. Cr/TS-1(30) showed 47.4% ethylene yield with a selectivity of 90.0% among these catalysts, whereas, this cat- alyst deactivated quickly during this reaction. In order to improve the catalytic stability of this family of materials new experiments are being carried out to modify the sup- ports and the active phase.
