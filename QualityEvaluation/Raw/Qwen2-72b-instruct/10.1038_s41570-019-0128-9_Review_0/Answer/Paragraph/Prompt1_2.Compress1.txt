{"DOC": "Support materials significantly impact CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help overcome diffusion issues and maintain highly dispersed active sites. The support's acidic or basic properties modify the dispersed active site's characteristics, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. Activated carbon-supported catalysts exhibit high conversion due to their high surface area and dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites. Oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides, despite similar surface areas, show varied catalytic activities. The support affects the redox cycle of iron oxide, with supported Cr2O3 showing better performance due to lower reoxidation rates compared to pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher in supported catalysts due to stronger Cr6+OM bonds. In supported chromium systems, isolated CrOx units prevent reoxidation, maintaining better catalytic performance.
