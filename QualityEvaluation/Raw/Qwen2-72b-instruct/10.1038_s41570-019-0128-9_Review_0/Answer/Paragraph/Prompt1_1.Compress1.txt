{"DOC": "Chromium oxide catalysts on SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 show high activity and selectivity, but excess Cr forms inactive polychromates, favoring undesired products. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 are most active, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 using DDE and RWGS pathways, susceptible to deactivation by coke, while CrOx/ZrO2 operates in a single step, deactivating through sintering or Cr speciation changes. CrOx/CeO2 is less active but more stable due to coke consumption by the reverse Boudouard reaction. CrOx/SiO2's activity and C3H6 selectivity increase with CO2 partial pressure, unlike CrOx/γ-Al2O3, which decreases. CO2 adsorption on γ-Al2O3 competes with C3H8 adsorption and affects CrOx/γ-Al2O3's acid-base properties. CrVI centers in MCM-41 activate CO2, and an 8wt% Cr content maximizes CrVI:CrIII ratios and alkane conversion. Excessive Cr content leads to agglomeration into α-Cr2O3 and inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species rapidly dehydrogenate alkanes, but CrIII reoxidation is slower, causing deactivation and coking in highly dispersed CrOx catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0"},
