{"DOC": "CrOx catalysts show peak activity and selectivity on SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 supports, but inactive polychromates favor undesired products. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 are most active, with the former using a two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, prone to deactivation by coke, and the latter performing CO2-ODH in a single step, deactivating via sintering or Cr speciation changes. CrOx/CeO2 is less active but more stable due to coke consumption. CrOx/SiO2 increases activity and C3H6 selectivity with higher CO2 partial pressure, unlike CrOx/γ-Al2O3, which decreases activity. CO2 adsorption on γ-Al2O3 competes with C3H8 adsorption and alters CrOx/γ-Al2O3's acid-base properties. CrVI centers in MCM-41 activate CO2, and 8wt% Cr content maximizes CrVI:CrIII ratios and alkane conversion. Excessive Cr content leads to agglomeration and inactive polychromate increase. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes faster than CrIII reoxidation, causing deactivation and coking in highly dispersed CrOx catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0"},
