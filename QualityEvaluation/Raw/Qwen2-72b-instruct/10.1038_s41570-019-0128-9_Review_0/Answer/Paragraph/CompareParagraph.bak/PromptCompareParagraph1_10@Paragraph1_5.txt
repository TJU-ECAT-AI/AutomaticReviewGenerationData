The performance, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO\(\_2\) oxidative dehydrogenation (CO\(\_2\)-ODH) reactions are profoundly influenced by the nature of support materials and reaction conditions. Chromium oxide, a versatile catalyst in the realm of CO\(\_2\) valorization, exhibits varying activity and selectivity depending on its interaction with the support and the surrounding reaction environment. The choice of support material is critical, as it can significantly alter the electronic and geometric properties of the chromium oxide active sites, thereby influencing the adsorption and activation of CO\(\_2\) and the hydrocarbon substrate (1). For instance, supports with high acidity, such as silica or alumina, can promote the formation of Lewis acid sites that enhance CO\(\_2\) activation, leading to improved CO\(\_2\)-ODH activity (2). Conversely, supports with basic properties, such as magnesium oxide, can stabilize the chromium species, enhancing catalyst stability under oxidative conditions (3).

Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-reactants, also play a pivotal role in determining the catalytic performance. Elevated temperatures generally favor the CO\(\_2\)-ODH reaction by increasing the kinetic energy of reactant molecules, but they can also lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering or the formation of inactive chromium species (4). The presence of water vapor or oxygen can further modulate the reaction pathway, affecting the selectivity towards desired products such as ethylene or acetylene (5). Oxygen, in particular, is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process, as it serves as the oxidant, regenerating the active chromium sites and preventing catalyst deactivation (6).

Mechanistic studies have revealed that the CO\(\_2\)-ODH reaction over chromium oxide catalysts proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen from the support is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process (7). The role of the support in this mechanism is twofold: it not only provides lattice oxygen but also stabilizes the chromium species, preventing their agglomeration and ensuring a high density of active sites (8). The interplay between the chromium oxide and the support is thus essential for the efficient and selective conversion of CO\(\_2\) to value-added hydrocarbons.

In summary, the effectiveness of chromium oxide catalysts in CO\(\_2\)-ODH reactions is intricately linked to the properties of the support materials and the reaction conditions. Tailoring these factors can significantly enhance the catalytic performance, offering a promising route for the sustainable utilization of CO\(\_2\) as a feedstock in the chemical industry.

The performance, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions are significantly influenced by support materials and reaction conditions \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\]. Chromium oxide supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 exhibits good performance in propane dehydrogenation, with CO2 having a promoting effect on Cr-O/SiO2 and a negative effect on Cr-O/Al2O3 for propene yield \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\]. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show high activity, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 favoring direct dehydrogenation of ethane and CrOx/ZrO2 promoting selective oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. CrOx/ZrO2 faces rapid deactivation at high temperatures due to sintering or inactive chromium species formation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. CrOx/CeO2, while less active, is the most stable due to the formation of α-Cr2O3, which is inactive in direct dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. Its stability is attributed to the removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to the support's basic sites \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, involving non-selective oxidation or dry-reforming reactions \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. CO2 partial pressure boosts CrOx/SiO2's activity and C3H6 selectivity, whereas CrOx/Al2O3's activity declines \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_0\]. CrVI centers in MCM-41 activate CO2, and an 8wt% Cr content maximizes CrVI:CrIII ratios and alkane conversion \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_0\]. Excessive Cr content leads to agglomeration and inactive polychromate species \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_0\]. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes faster than CrIII reoxidizes, causing deactivation and coking \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_0\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in the file highlight the pivotal role of support materials and reaction conditions in optimizing the performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel support materials that can enhance the stability and activity of chromium oxide catalysts while minimizing side reactions. Exploring the synergistic effects of mixed supports, such as CeO2-ZrO2, could offer new avenues for improving catalyst stability and selectivity. Additionally, the precise control of Cr content and the optimization of CO2 partial pressure could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The investigation of the redox cycle and the role of CrVI=O species in dehydrogenation could provide insights into the design of catalysts with enhanced reoxidation rates and reduced coking. Moreover, the exploration of the impact of steam on the acidity/basicity of CrOx/Al2O3 could open new perspectives on the modulation of catalyst properties for improved performance. The development of catalysts with tailored surface properties and optimized metal-support interactions could pave the way for the next generation of CO2-ODH catalysts.
