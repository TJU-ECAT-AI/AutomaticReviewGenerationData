However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits.

The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species.

The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst.

However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2, leading to deactivation of even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with appropriate Cr loading due to relatively inactive CrIII sites and eventual coking.", "Doi": "10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0"},

The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst. For example, activated carbon-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion due to their high surface area and high dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas but had significant differences in catalytic activities. The support can also affect the redox cycle of iron oxide. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. In supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus maintaining a better catalytic performance. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include maintaining high surface area, high dispersion of metal oxide, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing the catalytic activity and selectivity.", "Doi": "10.1039/c2ee22409g"}
