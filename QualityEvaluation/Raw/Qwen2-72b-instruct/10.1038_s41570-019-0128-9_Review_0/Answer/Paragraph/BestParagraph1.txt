        The performance, stability, and mechanistic behavior of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions are significantly influenced by support materials and reaction conditions \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\]. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 exhibit good performance in CO2-ODH reactions, with CO2 having a promoting effect on Cr-O/SiO2 and a negative effect on Cr-O/Al2O3, impacting propene yield \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\]. The synthesis gas composition can be controlled by adjusting the CO2:C3H8 molar ratio in the feed \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\]. Key challenges include achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining stability and preventing side reactions \[10.2478/v10026-012-0106-1\].

                    CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 show high activity in CO2-ODH reactions, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 favoring direct dehydrogenation of ethane and CrOx/ZrO2 promoting selective oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. CrOx/ZrO2 can deactivate rapidly at high temperatures due to sintering or inactive chromium species formation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. CrOx/CeO2, while less active, is the most stable due to the formation of α-Cr2O3, which is inactive in direct dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. Its stability is attributed to low ethylene formation activity and CO2 removal of carbon deposits \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\]. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, involving non-selective oxidation or dry-reforming reactions \[10.1016/j.cattod.2018.04.047\].

                    In CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, CO2 promotes the activity of SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, enhancing propylene yield and suppressing deactivation \[10.1246/cl.1996.973\]. This effect is specific to SiO2-supported catalysts, as observed in propane dehydrogenation \[10.1246/cl.1996.973\]. No data is available on other support materials or CO2 partial pressure effects \[10.1246/cl.1996.973\].

                    Chromium oxide catalysts on SiO2, MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 show high activity and selectivity, though excess Cr forms inactive polychromates \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 are most active but operate differently, with the former prone to deactivation by coke and the latter by sintering \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. CrOx/CeO2 is less active but more stable due to coke consumption \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. CO2 partial pressure boosts CrOx/SiO2's activity and C3H6 selectivity, whereas CrOx/γ-Al2O3's activity declines \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. CrVI centers in MCM-41 activate CO2, and an 8wt% Cr content maximizes CrVI:CrIII ratios, enhancing alkane conversion \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. Excessive Cr content leads to agglomeration and inactive polychromates \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\]. CrVI=O species rapidly dehydrogenate alkanes, but CrIII reoxidation is slower, causing deactivation and coking in highly dispersed CrOx catalysts \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_0\].

                    In CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, CrOx/SiO2 catalysts show enhanced propene yield with CO2, whereas CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit decreased yield and selectivity \[10.1007/s10562-004-3749-6\]. Steam's effect on catalytic performance was noted, with CO2 promoting dehydrogenation over SiO2 but not over Al2O3, suggesting changes in acidity/basicity of the Al2O3-supported catalyst \[10.1007/s10562-004-3749-6\].

                    In CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, Cr/SiO2 catalyst activity increases with higher CO2 partial pressure, whereas Cr/Al2O3 activity decreases with even a small amount of CO2, due to CO2 adsorption inhibiting C3H8 adsorption \[10.1016/j.cattod.2011.10.028\]. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 is crucial for dehydrogenation over both supports \[10.1016/j.cattod.2011.10.028\]. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI) species, enabling oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr/SiO2 in addition to simple dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2011.10.028\].

                    Support materials significantly impact CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which aid in overcoming diffusion issues and maintaining highly dispersed active sites \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Activated carbon-supported catalysts exhibit the highest conversion due to their high surface area and dispersion of metal oxide \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides show varied catalytic activities despite similar surface areas \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. The support's acidic or basic properties modify the active site's behavior, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Supported Cr2O3 catalysts have better performance due to lower reoxidation rates compared to pure chromia, with higher Cr6+O bond energy in supported catalysts \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. In supported chromium systems, CrOx units are isolated, limiting oxygen transfer and preventing reoxidation, thus enhancing catalytic performance \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, support type, support nature, changes in MOM bond strengths, and oxygen transfer ease are critical factors affecting redox catalysts' performance \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\]. Key challenges include maintaining high surface area, dispersion, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing activity and selectivity \[10.1039/c2ee22409g\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel support materials that can simultaneously enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The investigation of the role of CO2 partial pressure in the redox cycle and its impact on the formation of active Cr species could provide insights into optimizing the catalytic performance. Moreover, the exploration of the synergistic effects between different support materials and chromium oxide could lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts. The challenge of preventing reoxidation and maintaining high dispersion while maximizing activity and selectivity remains a critical area for future research. The potential of using advanced characterization techniques to understand the dynamic changes in the catalyst structure under reaction conditions could also be a promising direction. The development of catalysts that can effectively remove carbon deposits while maintaining high activity and selectivity could address the issue of deactivation and enhance the overall performance of CO2-ODH reactions.
