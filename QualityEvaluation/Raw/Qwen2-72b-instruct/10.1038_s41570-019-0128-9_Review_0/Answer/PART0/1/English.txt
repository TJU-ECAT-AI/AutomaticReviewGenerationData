The literature does not provide specific details on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials, particularly those supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, exhibit good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends on the catalyst nature, with CO2 having a promoting effect on Cr-O/SiO2 and a negative effect on Cr-O/Al2O3. The thermodynamic calculations and catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled by changing the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts are not explicitly stated but may include achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and preventing side reactions.

The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them. The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions. On CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions. The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species. CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH. Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/ and dry-reforming reactions.

The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of propylene and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. There is no information on the influence of other support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effect of CO2 partial pressure, or the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts.

Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2, leading to deactivation of even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with appropriate Cr loading due to relatively inactive CrIII sites and eventual coking.

The literature does not provide information on how various support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It only discusses the effect of SiO2 and Al2O3 as supports. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was also discussed. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

The support materials play a significant role in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help overcome diffusion problems and maintain highly dispersed active sites. The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst. For example, activated carbon-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion due to their high surface area and high dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas but had significant differences in catalytic activities. The support can also affect the redox cycle of iron oxide. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. In supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus maintaining a better catalytic performance. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include maintaining high surface area, high dispersion of metal oxide, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific details on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials, particularly those supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, exhibit good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends on the catalyst nature, with CO2 having a promoting effect on Cr-O/SiO2 and a negative effect on Cr-O/Al2O3. The thermodynamic calculations and catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled by changing the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts are not explicitly stated but may include achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and preventing side reactions.

The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them. The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions. On CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions. The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species. CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH. Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/ and dry-reforming reactions.

The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of propylene and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. There is no information on the influence of other support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effect of CO2 partial pressure, or the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts.

Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2, leading to deactivation of even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with appropriate Cr loading due to relatively inactive CrIII sites and eventual coking.

The literature does not provide information on how various support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It only discusses the effect of SiO2 and Al2O3 as supports. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was also discussed. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

The support materials play a significant role in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help overcome diffusion problems and maintain highly dispersed active sites. The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst. For example, activated carbon-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion due to their high surface area and high dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas but had significant differences in catalytic activities. The support can also affect the redox cycle of iron oxide. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. In supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus maintaining a better catalytic performance. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts.

The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include maintaining high surface area, high dispersion of metal oxide, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The literature does not provide specific details on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that chromium oxide-based materials, particularly those supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, exhibit good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends on the catalyst nature, with CO2 having a promoting effect on Cr-O/SiO2 and a negative effect on Cr-O/Al2O3. The thermodynamic calculations and catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled by changing the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 in the feed. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of these catalysts are not explicitly stated but may include achieving high conversion and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability and preventing side reactions.

The nature of the support influences the oxidation state of chromium species, and the activity and stability of the catalyst. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 exhibit the higher activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, but the reaction pathways are different on them. The main route for CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is a direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of ethane accompanied by the RWGS, with cracking and coke formation as side reactions. On CrOx/ZrO2 ethylene is formed by selective oxidative dehydrogenation and the side reactions are non-selective oxidation or/and dry-reforming reactions. The rapid deactivation of the CrOx/ZrO2 at high temperatures is caused by possible sintering of the catalyst and/or formation of inactive chromium species. CrOx/CeO2 is the less active, but the most stable catalyst due to formation of α-Cr2O3 phase that is inactive in DDH. Small contribution of selective ODH on this catalyst is connected with difficulties of surface re-oxidation by CO2. Relatively high stability of CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 is caused by their low activity for ethylene formation and removal of carbon deposits by CO2 due to basic sites of the supports. The side reactions for CrOx/CeO2 and CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 are similar to CrOx/ZrO2, i.e., non-selective oxidation or/ and dry-reforming reactions.

The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of propylene and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. There is no information on the influence of other support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effect of CO2 partial pressure, or the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts.

Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2, leading to deactivation of even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with appropriate Cr loading due to relatively inactive CrIII sites and eventual coking.

The literature does not provide information on how various support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It only discusses the effect of SiO2 and Al2O3 as supports. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was also discussed. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

The support materials play a significant role in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help overcome diffusion problems and maintain highly dispersed active sites. The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst. For example, activated carbon-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion due to their high surface area and high dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas but had significant differences in catalytic activities. The support can also affect the redox cycle of iron oxide. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. In supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus maintaining a better catalytic performance. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include maintaining high surface area, high dispersion of metal oxide, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing the catalytic activity and selectivity.
