[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
[3] "As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

1.The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure. In contrast, the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. CO2 can oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. In the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species takes place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

1.在丙烷脱氢反应中，Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强。相反，Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。在反应条件下，CO2可以将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。在Cr/SiO2的情况下，除了简单的Cr(III)物种脱氢外，丙烷在Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢也发生了。
