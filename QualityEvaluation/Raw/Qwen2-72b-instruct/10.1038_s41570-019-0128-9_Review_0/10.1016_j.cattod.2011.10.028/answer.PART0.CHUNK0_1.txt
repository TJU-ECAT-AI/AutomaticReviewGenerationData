[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
[3] "As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

1.The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

1.在CO2分压增加的情况下，Cr/SiO2催化剂的脱氢反应活性增强，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性在添加少量CO2后显著降低。在反应条件下，CO2可以将Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。在Cr/SiO2的情况下，除了Cr(III)物种的简单脱氢外，还发生了Cr(VI)物种对丙烷的氧化脱氢。
