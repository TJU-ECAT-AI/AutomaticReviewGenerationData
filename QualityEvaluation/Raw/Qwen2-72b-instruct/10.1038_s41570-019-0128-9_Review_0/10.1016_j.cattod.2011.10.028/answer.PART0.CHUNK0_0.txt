1.The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support.

1. Cr/SiO2的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。动力学分析表明，吸附在Al2O3上的CO2抑制了C3H8的吸附，并且CO2降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。Cr K-edge XAFS光谱和TPR剖面表明，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢中起着重要作用，无论支撑物如何。在反应条件下，CO2可以将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。结果，在Cr/SiO2的情况下，除了在Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢之外，C3H8在Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢也发生了。
