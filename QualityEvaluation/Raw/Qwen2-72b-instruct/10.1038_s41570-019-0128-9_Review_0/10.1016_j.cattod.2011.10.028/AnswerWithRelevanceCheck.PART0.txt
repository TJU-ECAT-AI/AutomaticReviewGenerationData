          [1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
          [2] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
          [3] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
          [4] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
          [5] "As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

          The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

          Cr/SiO2催化剂的脱氢反应活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性在添加少量CO2后显著降低。动力学分析表明，吸附在Al2O3上的CO2抑制了C3H8的吸附，并且CO2降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。Cr K-edge XAFS光谱和TPR剖面表明，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢中起着重要作用，无论支撑物如何。在反应条件下，CO2可以将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。在Cr/SiO2的情况下，除了Cr(III)物种的简单脱氢外，还发生了Cr(VI)物种对丙烷的氧化脱氢。
