Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
[3] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
[4] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
[5] "As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

1.The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a significant role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3, regardless of the support. CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition. As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

1. Cr/SiO2的活性随着CO2分压的增加而增强，而Cr/Al2O3的活性由于添加少量CO2而显著降低。动力学分析表明，吸附在Al2O3上的CO2抑制了C3H8的吸附，并且CO2降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。Cr K-edge XAFS光谱和TPR剖面表明，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在C3H6在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3上的脱氢中起着重要作用，无论支撑物如何。在反应条件下，CO2可以将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。结果，在Cr/SiO2的情况下，除了在Cr(III)物种上的简单脱氢之外，C3H8在Cr(VI)物种上的氧化脱氢也发生了。

1.The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions is enhanced with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts is significantly reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2. CO2 can oxidize Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions. In the case of Cr/SiO2, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species occurs in addition to simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.
