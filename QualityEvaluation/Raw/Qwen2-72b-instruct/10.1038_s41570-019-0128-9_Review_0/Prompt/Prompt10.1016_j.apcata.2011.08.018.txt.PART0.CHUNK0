Introduction Light alkenes such as propylene are important building blocks in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications thus,their demand is high [1,2].
A
great deal of attention has been paid to the so-called on-purpose propylene production technologies,such as propane dehydrogenation
(PDH)
[3,4],due to their potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers where propylene is produced as a byproduct of ethylene.
However,due to the thermodynamic constrains of
PDH
reaction,high reaction tem- perature is frequently used,which inevitably leads to severe coke formation as well as undesired thermal cracking to lighter alkanes [5,6].
Hence extra hydrogen addition in the gas feed and repeated regeneration are indispensable procedures implemented,making this process energy and capital intensive.
An attractive alterna- tive to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
of propane by molecular oxygen,which allows significantly lower reaction temperature and effective inhibition of coke deposition [7].
Nevertheless,significant loss of propylene selectivity due to Corresponding author at: Zhejiang Chemical Industry Research Institute,

(Y.
Cao). deep oxidation to carbon oxides is inevitably accompanied,existing as the main drawback of this process [1].
To circumvent this problem,carbon dioxide
(CO2),
one of the most important green-house gases,has been proposed to be a promising candidate as milder oxidant replacing oxygen in activation of light alkanes,including coupling of methane,dehy- drogenation
(DH)
of ethylbenzene,iso-propylbenzene,propane,or iso-butane [8].  In the
DH
reaction, CO2 is also expected to serve as a medium for supplying heat for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction,as a diluent for enhancing the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes and as an agent for the removal of coke formed on the catalyst [9].  On the other hand,contrarily to what is tradition- ally believed, CO2 is not inert in the oxidation reaction.
Oxygen species produced by its dissociation can modify the oxidation state of the surface atoms of the catalysts and can directly participate in the oxidation of the hydrocarbon [10,11]. Besides,taking into account the environmental concerns,
CO2,
one of the major green- house gases,accounts for the fast global warming tendency in the past decades.
In this context, CO2 recycling by the
PDH
technique,not only produces useful chemicals but also helps alleviate envi- ronmental pressure for excessive burning of fossil fuels,seemingly attractive from both economic and ecological perspective [12].
To date,in the field of
PDH
by
CO2,
Cr2O3-,
V2O5-
and Ga2O3- based materials are the most frequently reported catalytic systems.
For the Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts,the proposed one-step pathway is followed,in agreement with the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism [13,14].
The Ga2O3-based catalysts is proposed to obey

General 407 (2011) 20 28 21 a two-step pathway mechanism,which is a simple dehydrogena- tion step coupled with a subsequent reverse water gas shift
(RWGS)
reaction [15,16]. However,fast deactivation presents as a com- mon problem troubling all the above-mentioned catalyst systems,ascribed to either exhaustion of active lattice oxygen atoms or coke deposition.
Thus catalysts with prolonged lifetime are still highly desired.
Along this line,we have recently demonstrated that In2O3Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized via alcoholic coprecipita- tion was highly active and stable a new catalyst in the
PDH
with
CO2
[17,18]. An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed
PDH
reac- tion is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials,where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispens- able for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system.
In addition to the specific active phases,the choice of the support,conventionally thought to play important role in the dis- persion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species,is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given cata- lyst [1].  It is also suggested that acidbase properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene [2].  Hence,it is neces- sary to gain further insight into the support effect for the In-based catalysts.
To this end,in the present study,the support effect for In-based catalysts has been studied,and Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2 were selected as three supports,taking into account their differenti- ated surface properties in terms of affinity to In2O3 and relative acid/base strength.
For each support,both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized.
Detailed correlation of characteriza- tion results and
PDH
activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acidbase properties are two key parameters that determine the high
PDH
performance for the In-based catalysts.

Catalyst preparation The samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregna- tion using the appropriate amounts of In(NO3)3·5H2O from Aldrich (99.99%) in order to obtain two different indium oxide loadings for each support,one series of samples with loadings around 3 wt% (hereafter named In(3)/M or low loading samples) and the sec- ond one with loadings around 10 wt% (hereafter named In(10)/M or high loading samples).
