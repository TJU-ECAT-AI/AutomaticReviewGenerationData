I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Utilization of CO2 as soft oxidant is emerging as a potential technology for industrial production of alkenes. Traditional way of alkene production in mass scale involves direct dehydrogenation of alkanes,which is energetically expensive. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is a greener alternate to the traditional normal dehydrogenation process. Hence, this area has drawn remarkable investment of research interest worldwide. From environmental point of view, utilization of CO2 is accepted as a means to mitigate the ever increasing greenhouse gas effect. CO2 utilization is also attractive for its abundant availability and cheaper cost. But utilization of CO2 suffers from the limitation of its inherent inertness.
Application of suitable catalyst can help to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic barrier of CO2 activation. Exploitation of the soft oxidant property of CO2 with the help of suitable catalyst in commercial scale can give a boost to polymer and fuel economy. Hence, it is interesting to focus on the possibilities of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation process. The challenges met in this process and the invention of catalytic technologies to address those problems are summarized in this mini-review. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<questions>


How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
