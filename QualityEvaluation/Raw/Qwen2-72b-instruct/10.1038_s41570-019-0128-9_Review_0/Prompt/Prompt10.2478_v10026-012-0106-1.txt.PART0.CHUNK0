INTRODUCTION
Propane dehydrogenation with CO2 (DHP-CO2) has been recently investigated as an alternative to traditional dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)  that is currently applied as one of the methods of propene production.
In the new process with CO2 the yield of propene is higher than in the traditional ones. This promoting ef- fect of CO2 is due to its participation in the following reaction (24):
C3H8  C3H6 + H2
(1)
CO2 + H2  CO + H2O
(2)
CO2 + C3H8  C3H6 + CO + H2O
(3)
CO2 + C  2CO
(4) It is generally accepted that one of the most important roles of CO2 in the DH-CO2 is  consumption of hydrogen that is produced in the thermodynamically limited DHP reaction. Coupling of DHP (reaction 1) with the reverse water-gas shift RWGS (reaction 2) enhances the yield of propene. Such promoting effect of CO2 was postulated not only in the case of DHP-CO2 but also in dehydro- genation of other hydrocarbons such as, ethane, butanes and ethylbenzene over different oxide-based catalysts16.
It was also postulated that CO2 may participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction 3) that is an additional way of propene formation as well as in coke gasifi cation (reaction 4) that enhances the catalyst stability.
From the above it is clear that the additional useful (from chemical point of view) product of DHP-CO2 is CO that is formed in reactions 24. This compound separately or together with H2 produced in reaction 1 (CO + H2  synthesis gas) has many applications.
The goal of the present work was to discuss the pos- sibilities of the application of the primary products of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 other than propene,based on thermodynamic considerations and catalytic tests. We have proposed several pathways for the utiliza- tion of synthesis gas produced in the DHP-CO2 process.
EXPERIMENTAL
The thermodynamic data of the substances were taken from the database Chemcad II Version 2.60. The calcula- tion of the equilibrium yield of propene and molar ratio of CO/H2 were done as reported previously7.
Two kinds of oxides were used as supports; -Al2O3 (BET surface 155 m2·g-1, Aldrich) and SiO2 (BET surface 304 m2·g-1, POCH Poland). The Cr-O/SiO2 and Cr-O/ Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the impregnation tech- nique from an aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)3 (POCH, Poland). The solutions were mixed with the supports (SiO2, -Al2O3), followed by evaporation under constant stirring and calcined at 923 K for 3 h in air. The intended content of Cr in the both catalysts was 3.4 wt.%.
The interaction of CO2 with the surface of the supports and catalysts was probed by FTIR spectroscopy. Before the experiments the samples (prepared as self-supporting discs, 10 mg) were placed in IR cell and then activated in vacuum (10-3 Pa) at 873 K for 60 min. Then after the sample was cooled and dry CO2 adsorption was carried out at room temperature. The FTIR spectra were re- corded at 298 K after evacuation of CO2 from the cell for 30 min at 298 K (10-3 Pa) on Equinox 55 Bruker spectrometer with a MCT detector (resolution 2 cm-1).
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 was carried out in the fl ow-type quartz reactor packed with 500 mg catalyst (grain size 0.20.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of propane (Linde, 99.95%),carbon dioxide (Linde, 99.9993%) and helium (Linde,
99.999%). The partial pressure of propane was kept
constant (14.5 kPa), and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was changed by diluting CO2 with He.  In all the cases the total fl ow rate was 30 cm3·min-1. The catalysts were fi rst preheated in a stream of helium at 873 K and then the reaction was started at this temperature.
The reactants and products were analyzed on-line using two gas chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a glass column (3mx3mm) packed with Porapak Q and a fl ame ionization detector. It was used to analyze the hydrocarbons C1-C3. The second chromatograph was equipped with a stainless steel column (3mx3mm) packed with Carboxen 1000 and, a thermal conductiv- ity detector (for CO, H2 and CO2 analyses). Propane conversion, hydrocarbons yields and propene selectivity were calculated as reported previously8.
Under reaction conditions applied in this work the conversion of propane in the process without catalysts was below 1%.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
Thermodynamic considerations The results of  thermodynamic considerations reported in literature indicate that in the dehydrogenation with CO2 the yield of propene is higher than in the simple dehydrogenation that is a widely commercialized process for propene production. Calculations of equilibrium con- version for propane dehydrogenation alone (DHP) and for propane dehydrogenation coupling with the RWGS (DHP-RWGS) indicate that the equilibrium yield of propene is much higher in the presence of CO2 than in its absence1. In other words, by using CO2 as a coregent similar propene yield as in the traditional processes can be obtained at lower temperature. The effect of the temperature and molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 substrates on the equilibrium yield of propene is presented in Table 1. ratios are suitable for the chemical processes in which synthesis gas is the substrate. The general description (reaction conditions, synthesis gas composition, ect.) of the most important industrial processes in which the synthesis gas as the substrate was used is reported on in Table 3. It can be generally seen that in all these processes the synthesis gas with relatively low molar ratios of CO/H2 (10.5) is applied. The thermodynamic considerations reported in Table 2 indicate that in the DHP-CO2 such values can be obtained only when the initial ratios of CO2/C3H8 are equal 1:1 or lower. Us- ing the feed gas rich in CO2 (CO2/C3H8 > 1) leads to obtaining the synthesis gas with a higher CO/H2 ratios which have to be corrected before being used in any mentioned processes.
The thermodynamic considerations indicate that the temperature has much smaller effect on the equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2. Moreover, the effect of tempera- ture on the CO/H2 value varies with the initial composition of feed gas. At initial molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 between
1:1 to 0.2:1 the values of CO/H2 decrease slightly as
temperature increase from 673 to 973 K, while when the initial ratio of CO2:C3H8 is 5:1, the CO/H2 ratio drops gradually between 673773 K and then increases above 823 K.
Catalytic tests Our previous catalytic experiments and literature results reveal that the catalysts which are active and selective in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes exhibit also good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2. Therefore, it is not suppressing that chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a one of the most promising catalysts for DHP-CO2.
Table 4 summarized the results obtained over selected chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 at 823 K and 873
K. Over the investigated catalysts propane conversion
and propene yield increase with the increase of reac- tion temperature, while the selectivity to propene drops as the reaction temperature increases.  In addition to the primary products (propene, CO, H2 and H2O-not analyzed) several others by-products, such as methane,ethane and ethene are produced. These byproducts are formed with quite similar selectivities over Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts both in the presence and absence of CO2 while over Cr-O/Al2O3 the selectivities to methane and ethene are much higher in the processes carried out with CO2.
Over both catalysts, in the investigated narrow range of temperature, the ratios of CO/H2 are changed slightly.
As we reported in our previous works concerning SBA-19 and MCM-417 supported chromium oxide systems the CO/H2 values (or H2/CO) vary much signifi cantly in a wider range of temperature, i.e. 673923 K. However,from a practical point of view, the range 823873 K is more suitable. Below 823 K the conversion of propane is insignifi cant and a large amount of unreacted substrates has to be separated and recycled, whereas above 873 K the side reactions leading to fast catalyst deactivation and low selectivity to primary product are accelerated.
Figures 1a and b display the variation of the yield of propene and molar ratio of CO/H2 with feed gas com- position over Cr-O/Al2O3 and Cr-O/SiO2 catalysts. It is Table 1. Variation of equilibrium yield of propene with tem- perature and initial molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 (feed gas composition)a From this table it is clear that the equilibrium yield of propene increases with the increase either of the initial molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 or the temperature. Further- more, the data reported in Table 2 indicates that by changing the temperature and the feed gas compositions (ratio of CO2/C3H8) not only the yield of propene can be controlled but also the molar ratio of other useful primary products, i.e. CO/H2 (synthesis gas).
Under the investigated conditions the CO/H2 ratio varies in a wide range between 4.0 to 0.2. Some of these Table 2. Variation of equilibrium molar ratio of CO/H2 with temperature and initial molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 (feed gas composition)a Unauthenticated Download Date  5/22/16 4:01 PM
Pol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 14, No. 4, 2012 79 clear that over both investigated materials CO2 exerts an opposite effect on propene yield (Fig.1a) and a similar effect on the molar ratio of CO/H2 (Fig.1b). Over the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst that is commercially applied in pro- pane dehydrogenation (e.g. in CATOFIN Process) even a small amount of CO2  in the feed leads to a dramatic decrease of propene yield. In contrast, over Cr-O/SiO2 carbon dioxide exerts a promoting effect on the yield of propene. With the increasing molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 the yield of propene increases gradually. However, the Table 3. General description of selected processes used synthesis gas.
Unauthenticated Download Date  5/22/16 4:01 PM 80 Pol. J. Chem. Tech., Vol. 14, No. 4, 2012 positive effect of CO2 observed over Cr-O/SiO2 is much smaller than the negative effect exerted on the catalytic performances of Cr-O/Al2O3.
Such great differences in the effects of CO2 are probably caused by the difference in supports nature.
Figure 2 a and b show the IR spectra obtained after the adsorption of CO2 on -Al2O3, SiO2, Cr-O/Al2O3 and Cr-O/SiO2 activated at 873 K. No new spectral features developed following the deposition of chromium oxide on the supports. In the case of Cr-O/Al2O3 and -Al2O3 strong bands appeared at 1646, 1474, 1443, 1233 and 2345 cm-1. These bands were assigned to two families of adsorbed species: (i) carbonate-like species charac- terized by CO bands at 1646, 1474, 1443 cm-1 and by a band OH at 1233 cm-1 (Fig.2a) and (ii) linear form of cation-coordinated CO2 species characterized by strong band at 2345 cm-1 (Fig.2b)10,11. The linear species are formed by the interaction of CO2 with Lewis acid sites,whereas carbonate-like species by the interaction with basic hydroxyl groups or with acid-base sites10. The ap- pearance of the band at 1233 cm-1 confi rmed formation of HOCO2 - species, which are formed by the interaction of CO2 with basic OH groups persisting after activation at 873 K. Similar experiments on SiO2 and Cr-O/SiO2 catalyst produced very weak adsorption bends at 1620,2340 and 2364 cm-1, which clearly indicates that, the basicity and Lewis acidity of these materials are much weaker than those of Cr-O/Al2O3 and -Al2O3. These results coincide well with general observation that oxides of semi-metal elements, like SiO2, show weak basicity and Lewis acidity, while ionic oxides, like -Al2O3, show medium basicity and strong Lewis acidity12.
The FTIR studies lead us to suggest that the unfa- vorable effect of CO2 observed in the dehydrogenation of propane on the Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by the nature of γ-Al2O3. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 may certainly reduce the possibility of propane adsorption on the surface of Cr-O/Al2O3 catalyst, leading to redu- ced propane conversion. A similar explanation for the inhibiting effect of CO2 was proposed by Xu et al.13.
CONCLUSIONS
The process of propane dehydrogenation in the pre- sence of CO2 can be considered not only as an alterna- tive to traditional dehydrogenation of propane pathway of propene production but also as a new resourses of synthesis gas. The thermodynamic calculations for the simplifi ed model and the catalytic tests indicate that the synthesis gas composition (molar ratio of CO/H2) can be controlled easily by changing the molar ratio of
CO2:C3H8 in the feed. Moreover, the catalytic experi-
ments indicate that the effect of CO2 on the yield of Figure 1.
