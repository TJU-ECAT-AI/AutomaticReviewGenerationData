1.Chromium oxide catalysts exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest activity but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acid-base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3. The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 is attributed to isolated CrVI centers generated from CrIII in a redox cycle. Increasing the Cr content to 8wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion. However, further increasing the Cr content leads to uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2, leading to deactivation of even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with appropriate Cr loading due to relatively inactive CrIII sites and eventual coking.

1.铬氧化物催化剂在SiO2、硅质MCM-41和高SiO2含量的H-ZSM-5等材料的支持下表现出最高的活性和选择性。然而，这些材料中的大部分Cr以非活性多铬酸盐的形式存在，导致对不希望的产品有更大的选择性。CrOx催化剂在C2H6的CO2-ODH中的氧化态取决于支持材料，CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2复合材料表现出最高的活性，但通过不同的途径工作。CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要通过两步DDE和RWGS机制工作，由于大量焦炭的形成，可能会发生失活。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2在一步中执行CO2-ODH，失活涉及烧结或转化为非活性Cr物种。当CrOx被CeO2支持时，它的活性较低，但稳定性更高，因为逆Boudouard反应可以消耗焦炭沉积物。在873K下对CO2-ODHP反应的研究表明，CrOx/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加，其活性和C3H6选择性增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性随着CO2分压的轻微增加而降低。这两种支持材料之间的不同表现归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上吸附得更强，与C3H8吸附竞争，和/或CO2影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸碱性质。CrOx在MCM-41中分散时CO2的活化归因于从CrIII在氧化还原循环中生成的孤立CrVI中心。将Cr含量增加到8wt%提供了最大的CrVI:CrIII比率和增加的烷烃转化率。然而，进一步增加Cr含量会导致较大颗粒的不均匀分布，这些颗粒倾向于聚集成α-Cr2O3并增加非活性多铬酸盐的浓度。CrVI=O物种将烷烃脱氢为相应的烯烃的速度比从CO2中提取O的CrIII物种重新氧化的速度快，导致即使具有适当Cr负载的高分散CrOx催化剂由于相对非活性的CrIII位点和最终的焦化而失活。
