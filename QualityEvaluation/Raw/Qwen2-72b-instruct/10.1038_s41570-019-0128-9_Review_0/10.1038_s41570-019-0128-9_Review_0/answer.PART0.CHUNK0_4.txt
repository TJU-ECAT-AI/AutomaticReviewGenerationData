1.Cr oxides show the highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials with high SiO2 content, such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 is influenced by the support material, with CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibiting the highest ODHE activities but operating through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, which can lead to deactivation if cracking results in substantial coke formation. In contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, with deactivation involving sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. When CrOx is supported on CeO2, it is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies have shown that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3.

1.铬氧化物在具有高二氧化硅含量的材料（如SiO2、硅质MCM-41和H-ZSM-5）的支持下，显示出最高的活性和选择性。然而，这些材料中的大部分铬以非活性多铬酸盐的形式存在，导致对不期望的产品具有更高的选择性。CrOx催化剂在C2H6的CO2-ODH中的氧化态受支持材料的影响，CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2复合材料表现出最高的ODHE活性，但通过不同的途径运作。CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要通过两步DDE和RWGS机制工作，如果裂解导致大量焦炭形成，可能会导致失活。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2在一步法中进行CO2-ODH，失活涉及烧结或转化为非活性铬物种。当CrOx在CeO2上时，它的活性较低，但更稳定，因为逆向Boudouard反应可以消耗焦炭沉积物。研究表明，CrOx/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加，活性和C3H6选择性增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性即使在CO2分压略有增加的情况下也会降低。这两种支持材料之间的不同表现归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上吸附得更强，与C3H8吸附竞争，和/或CO2影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸碱性质。
