[1] "Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content27,53."
[2] "Although Cr oxides can be incorporated into mesoporous structures to afford more active species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates and the materials thus show greater selectivity for undesired products54."
[3] "The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2 (ref.46)."
[4] "The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways."
[5] "Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke."
[6] "By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species."
[7] "Instead, when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits."
[8] "Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure27,50,53."
[9] "The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3."

1.铬氧化物在二氧化硅、硅质MCM-41和高二氧化硅含量的H-ZSM-5等材料的支持下，具有最高的活性和选择性。然而，这些材料中的大部分铬以非活性的多铬酸盐形式存在，导致对不期望的产品具有更大的选择性。CrOx催化剂在C2H6的CO2-ODH中的氧化态取决于支持材料。CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2复合材料具有最高的ODHE活性，但通过不同的途径运行。CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要通过两步DDE和RWGS机制工作，如果裂解产生大量焦炭，则可能发生失活。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2以单步进行CO2-ODH（尽管与DR竞争），其失活模式涉及烧结或转化为非活性铬物种。当CrOx在CeO2上时，它的活性较低，但更稳定，因为逆向Boudouard反应可以迅速消耗焦炭沉积物。在873K下对CO2-ODHP反应的研究表明，CrOx/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加，活性和C3H6选择性都会增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性即使在CO2分压略有增加的情况下也会降低。这两种支持材料之间的不同表现归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上吸附得更强，与C3H8吸附竞争，和/或CO2影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸碱性质。

1.铬氧化物催化剂在SiO2、硅质MCM-41和高SiO2含量的H-ZSM-5等材料的支持下表现出最高的活性和选择性。然而，这些材料中的大部分Cr以非活性多铬酸盐的形式存在，导致对不希望的产品有更大的选择性。CrOx催化剂在C2H6的CO2-ODH中的氧化态取决于支持材料，CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2复合材料表现出最高的活性，但通过不同的途径工作。CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要通过两步DDE和RWGS机制工作，由于大量焦炭的形成，可能会发生失活。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2在一步中执行CO2-ODH，失活涉及烧结或转化为非活性Cr物种。当CrOx被CeO2支持时，它的活性较低，但稳定性更高，因为逆Boudouard反应可以消耗焦炭沉积物。在873K下对CO2-ODHP反应的研究表明，CrOx/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加，其活性和C3H6选择性增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性随着CO2分压的轻微增加而降低。这两种支持材料之间的不同表现归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上吸附得更强，与C3H8吸附竞争，和/或CO2影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸碱性质。CrOx在MCM-41中分散时CO2的活化归因于从CrIII在氧化还原循环中生成的孤立CrVI中心。将Cr含量增加到8wt%提供了最大的CrVI:CrIII比率和增加的烷烃转化率。然而，进一步增加Cr含量会导致较大颗粒的不均匀分布，这些颗粒倾向于聚集成α-Cr2O3并增加非活性多铬酸盐的浓度。CrVI=O物种将烷烃脱氢为相应的烯烃的速度比从CO2中提取O的CrIII物种重新氧化的速度快，导致即使具有适当Cr负载的高分散CrOx催化剂由于相对非活性的CrIII位点和最终的焦化而失活。
