1.Cr oxides have the highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41, and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content. However, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates, leading to greater selectivity for undesired products. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on the support material. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites have the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation due to substantial coke formation. CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step, competing with DR, and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. CrOx on CeO2 is less active but more stable due to the reverse Boudouard reaction consuming coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP reaction at 873K show that CrOx/SiO2 exhibits increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, while the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 decreases with even a slight increase in CO2 partial pressure. The different performance between these two supports is attributed to CO2 adsorbing more strongly on γ-Al2O3, competing with C3H8 adsorption, and/or CO2 affecting the acidbase properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3.

1.铬氧化物在二氧化硅、硅质MCM-41和高二氧化硅含量的H-ZSM-5等材料的支持下，具有最高的活性和选择性。然而，这些材料中的大部分铬以非活性的多铬酸盐形式存在，导致对不期望的产品具有更大的选择性。CrOx催化剂在C2H6的CO2-ODH中的氧化态取决于支持材料。CrOx/γ-Al2O3和CrOx/ZrO2复合材料具有最高的ODHE活性，但通过不同的途径运行。CrOx/γ-Al2O3主要通过两步DDE和RWGS机制工作，如果裂解产生大量焦炭，则可能发生失活。相比之下，CrOx/ZrO2以单步进行CO2-ODH（尽管与DR竞争），其失活模式涉及烧结或转化为非活性铬物种。当CrOx在CeO2上时，它的活性较低，但更稳定，因为逆向Boudouard反应可以迅速消耗焦炭沉积物。在873K下对CO2-ODHP反应的研究表明，CrOx/SiO2随着CO2分压的增加，活性和C3H6选择性都会增加，而CrOx/γ-Al2O3的活性即使在CO2分压略有增加的情况下也会降低。这两种支持材料之间的不同表现归因于CO2在γ-Al2O3上吸附得更强，与C3H8吸附竞争，和/或CO2影响CrOx/γ-Al2O3的酸碱性质。
