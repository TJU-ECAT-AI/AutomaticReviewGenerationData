[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

1.The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of propylene and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. There is no information about the influence of other support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

1.研究发现,只有在SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上,二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的反应中具有促进作用。二氧化碳在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的促进作用是提高丙烯的产率和抑制催化剂失活。没有关于MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、ZrO2和CeO2等其他支撑材料,或CO2分压对铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径影响的信息。
