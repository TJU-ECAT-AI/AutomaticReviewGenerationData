[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

1.The effects of carbon dioxide were investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propene (C3H6) over chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts supported on various materials including aluminum oxide (Al2O3), active carbon, and silicon dioxide (SiO2). It was found that carbon dioxide only had a promoting effect on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide on the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst included enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
