Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

1.The study found that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of propylene and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. There is no information on the influence of other support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, or the effect of CO2 partial pressure, or the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of the catalysts.

1.The effects of carbon dioxide were investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propene (C3H6) over chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts supported on various materials including aluminum oxide (Al2O3), active carbon, and silicon dioxide (SiO2). It was found that carbon dioxide only had a promoting effect on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide on the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst included enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
