Catalysis Today 24 (1995) 307-313 The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane as an alternative way for the production of light olefins
F. Cavani, F. Trifirb
Dipartimento di Chimica lndustriale e dei Materiali, Viale Risorgimento 4, 40136 Bologna, Italy Abstract The main aspects of ethane and propane oxydehydrogenation are discussed. The performance of the various catalysts described in the literature has been compared.
I. Introduction
The demand for olefins and products made from olefins is increasing, and the existing capacity might become insufficient to meet this demand.Until recently, light olefins (along with methane and aromatics) have been obtained from steam cracking of natural gas and of naphtha and from FCC in oil refining. These established processes are extremely capital-intensive; the products have to be separated and purified for use in downstream plants that require fairy pure feedstocks, and the supply and demand for each coproduct are rarely in balance. Consequently, the incremental future demand for olefins might be satisfied by direct productions of individual or specific cuts of olefins by selective processes. In addition, integration of these plants with downstream olefin conversion plants can be advantageous in many cases [ 1 ].
Commercial processes for the synthesis of light olefins through paraffins dehydrogenation are available, even though their main application is for isobutene synthesis. In the case of propane, a couple of plants are on service, while in the case of ethane thermodynamic constraints would force 0920-5861/95/$09.50  1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved

to operate at impracticable temperatures. The commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes suffer from several limitations, especially: i) ther- modynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) strongly endothermic reactions to which large amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of coke on the catalyst which requires frequent regeneration. With the goal of overcoming these limitations, research is proceeding along some directions, of which the following are the most likely to be implemented: i) optimization of cur- rent dehydrogenation technologies, to obtain more selective, stable and environmentally safe cata- lysts and lower investments and utility costs; ii) dehydrogenation coupled with hydrogen oxida- tion, to supply the heat of reaction inside the cat- alytic bed while avoiding overheating and to shift the equilibrium toward the desired products; iii) oxidative dehydrogenation, to overcome thermo- dynamic limitations, operate at low temperature with an exothermic reaction, and avoid frequent catalyst regeneration; iv) membrane-assisted dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation,308

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation
Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molec- ular oxygen in the reaction medium. This process has the potential to overcome the major technical problems associated with pure dehydrogenation.
However, other problems arise, related to the removal of the heat of reaction, control of selec- tivity due to the formation of undesired oxygen- ated by-products and carbon oxides,the flammability of the reaction mixtures, the possi- bility of run-away of the reaction. No commercial plants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins are believed to be currently operational,although pilot or demonstration plants have been built and operated. A great variety of catalysts have been formulated and tested [ 1-42]. Curi- ously, best catalytic systems for ethane oxydehy- drogenation are not the optimal ones for higher paraffins, and vice versa. This is likely due to the fact that the different features of both reactant paraffins and formed olefins make the mechanism of olefin formation and degradation different in the two cases.
2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane
Some of the catalysts developed for the reaction of methane coupling are also active in the ethane oxydehydrogenation. In other cases, entirely new catalytic systems have been developed. The per- formances of catalysts reported in literature is summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. con- version plot, and the levels of maximum produc- tivity obtained at the average operative temperature for each system.
Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:a) Catalysts based on ions and oxides of Group IA and IIA metals, which are also active for meth- ethylene selectivity, %

309 ane coupling [ 2-10] ; these activate ethane at tem- peratures usually higher than 600C to form ethyl radicals, which then further react in the gas phase.
The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/ Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical formation, analogously to that occurring with methane. The role of the generation of Li +-O- centers capable of abstracting a H. and forming the ethyl radical. However, a progressive loss of Li occurs at temperatures higher than 700C. Such catalysts could be employed after a methane couS piing reactor, in order to increase the yield to eth- ylene through oxydehydrogenation of formed ethane. Catalysts for coupling operate at 700- 800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogen- ation reactor.
High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be achieved with this catalytic system, above all when chlorine-containing compounds are also fed to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with halides [9,10] ; the promoter effect is maintained by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which mod- ifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ] ; chlorine radicals are thought to favour the homogeneous decom- position of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Yields as high as 34% to ethylene could be achieved [ 3,10] ;however, the use of chlorine is limited by prob- lems related to equipment corrosion.
The selectivity to ethylene is increased with temperature; this is due to the fact that the formed ethyl radical at high temperature (600-700C;above 700C homogeneous overoxidation of eth- ylene decreases the selectivity) desorbs and forms ethylene in the gas phase via reaction with molec- ular oxygen; the high stability of ethylene and the contribution of the heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions lead to the observed high selectivity. At lower temperatures the formation of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor of COx formation.
A further aspect of this system is the formation of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- position to CO, C and H2. Recently [ 13 ], it was found that catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/ O are active in the water gas shift at the tempera- tures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation occurs.
Other systems that are active at temperatures higher than 600C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides (mainly CeO2) [ 14]. b) Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [ 15-23 ]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [ 12,15 ], and yield ethylene with high productiv- ity and good selectivity. In addition, they exhibit a very high stability even at high temperature.
Doping Sm203 with alkali metals gives the best performances. These systems are believed to oper- ate with a mechanism similar to that of Li/Mg/O catalysts.
Also Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates at very high temperature; such system is claimed for cyclic operation with ARCO [ 16] or Phillips [ 17] technology in circulating-bed applications, where higher selectivities are achieved by dividing the reaction into two stages: i) oxydehydrogenation of the paraffin in the absence of molecular oxygen and ii) regeneration of the catalyst by treatment with air.
In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon,through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous,hence controlled by the catalyst; the contribution of homogeneous reactions only occurs at the high- est temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at temperatures as low as 250C, with selectivity to ethylene higher than 80%. However, the reported experimental conditions lead to an ethylene pro- ductivity which appears to be too low to have practical application. Mo/V/Nb/O also forms considerable amounts of acetic acid.
