1.The literature does not provide information on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx/MO2ZrO2 (M = Ce or Ti) catalysts promoted by CO2. It does not discuss chromium oxide catalysts or the specific support materials and reaction conditions mentioned in the question.

The literature focuses on the investigation of CO2 promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx/MO2ZrO2 (M = Ce or Ti) catalysts. It discusses the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of these catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane with CO2 as the soft oxidant. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing the overall performance of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are not addressed in the document.

The literature focuses on the investigation of CO2 promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over VOx/MO2ZrO2 (M = Ce or Ti) catalysts. It discusses the preparation of CeO2ZrO2 (CZ) and TiO2ZrO2 (TZ) mixed metal oxide supports and the deposition of vanadium oxide on these supports. The document highlights the influence of the support material and the redox properties of the catalyst on the catalytic activity for n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. However, it does not address chromium oxide catalysts or the specific effects of CO2 partial pressure on activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways.
