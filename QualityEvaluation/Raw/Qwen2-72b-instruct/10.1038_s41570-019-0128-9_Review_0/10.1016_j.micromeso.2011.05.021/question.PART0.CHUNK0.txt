Carbon dioxide a b s t r a c t ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts prepared by an incipient wetness method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide. Several techniques including XRD, N2 adsorption, SEM, 27Al MAS NMR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UV Vis spectroscopy and H2-TPR were applied to characterize the physicochemical properties of the as- synthesized materials. Catalytic tests show that the chromia catalyst supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (ca. 400 nm) exhibits a good catalytic performance, which is much more active than that supported on ZSM-5 with larger crystal size (ca. 2 lm). A high number of Cr(VI) species in the cal- cined catalyst is crucial for its high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with

1. Introduction
The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes has attracted considerable attention, be- cause the alkenes constitute an important and versatile class of intermediates in the petrochemical industry [1,2]. Propylene is one of the most important commodity petrochemicals, as a raw material for the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile,acrolein, acrylic acid and so on. From the viewpoint of its applica- tions propylene could be compared to ethylene. At present, a major- ity of propylene is obtained as a by-product of ethylene production by the naphtha steam-cracking process and of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of petroleum. Due to the rapidly growing demand for propylene and the shortage of petroleum resource in the future,much effort has been dedicated to new routes of propylene produc- tion from alternative substrates, such as dehydrogenation of pro- pane and natural gas-based processes [36].
The inherent drawbacks of the propane dehydrogenation pro- cess are equilibrium limitations regarding propane conversion,large energy consumption due to endothermic reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation owing to coke formation [7,8]. Alternatively,the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temper- atures with an exothermic reaction [9]. However, this process suf- fers from a significant loss of propylene selectivity due to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide in the reaction. Han- dling the potentially explosive oxygen-containing mixture is also difficult. Therefore, it is expected that these disadvantages will be avoided to some extent via replacing oxygen by soft oxidants,such as N2O and CO2 [1012].
Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has gained increasing interest. It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a rather high selectivity [13,14]. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the propane dehydrogenation reaction was observed on silica-supported Cr2O3 [13], rare earth vanadates [15], Ga2O3 and TiO2-supported Ga2O3 [1618], and In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide [19]. It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene via a redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by pro- pane) and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [13,14,20,21] or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse watergas shift reaction [1719,22]. In the latter case CO2 removes hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation,and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propylene formation. Moreover, the use of CO2 in the feed is also ecological,because in this new process CO2, one of the major greenhouse gases, is reduced to CO which is more valuable in chemical industry.

Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 145 (2011) 194199 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Microporous and Mesoporous Materials journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/micromeso oxide-based materials have been documented as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. Attention has been recently focused on employing mesoporous silica materials as catalyst supports to disperse chromium species, such as MCM- 41 [20,23], SBA-1 [24], SBA-15 [25] and MSU-x [26] due to their high surface areas, uniform mesopore size and relatively high ther- mal stability. However, it is well known that the potential disad- vantage of these siliceous mesoporous materials is relatively poor hydrothermal stability.
Zeolites are a class of microporous crystalline materials that find widespread use in the petrochemical industry. ZSM-5, a typical MFI- type zeolite, is considered to be a good catalyst or catalyst support [2,6,27,2831] because of its unique properties, including tri- dimensional micropore structure, high surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, special molecular sieving and shape selective capabilities. In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of ZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 [29,30,32], in the present work, we report for the first time the use of ZSM-5-supported chro- mium oxide as a new efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Our results have shown that the crystallite size of the ZSM-5 support has a profound effect on the catalytic activity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Sub-microsize ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally prepared by modifying very slightly the procedures reported in the literature [33]. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25% aqueous solu- tion) was used as the template. The silicon source was tetraethylor- thosilicate (TEOS), and the aluminum source was NaAlO2. Typically, NaAlO2 was dissolved in an aqueous solution containing TPAOH.
TEOS was then added into the above solution. The resultant mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature, followed by heating at 50 C under stirring to evaporate ethanol formed. The molar compo- sition of the clear gel was 120SiO2:1Al2O3:48TPAOH:3600H2O. Fi- nally, the gel was transferred into an autoclave and crystallized at 170 C for 2 days. The product was collected by centrifugation,washed, dried at 110 C overnight and then calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h to remove the template. Microsize ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized as follows.
Typically, Na2- SiO39H2O, NaAlO2 and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) were first dissolved in water. In order to adjust the gel pH, 60% H2SO4 aqueous solution was then added slowly under stirring until the pH value is near 9.0. The molar composition of the synthesis mixture was 120SiO2:1Al2O3:48TPABr:19,200H2O. After being stir- red at room temperature for 4 h, the gel was transferred into an autoclave and crystallized at 170 C for 2 days. The product was fil- tered, washed, dried at 110 C overnight and then calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h. The parent ZSM-5 zeolites were turned into the Na- form by three consecutive ion exchanges with 1 mol/l NaNO3 solu- tion at 80 C for a total of 12 h. The sub-microsize and microsize ZSM-5 zeolites are labeled as ZSM-5-S and ZSM-5-L, respectively.
The supported chromium oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Cr(NO3)39H2O on ZSM-5-S and ZSM-5-L using an incipient wetness method. The impregnated samples were dried at 110 C overnight and calcined in air at 600 C for 4 h. The obtained catalysts are denoted as Cr/ZSM-5-S and Cr/ZSM-5-L, respectively. The content of Cr in both catalysts was 3 wt.%.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Ka radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The bulk Si/Al ratios of the prepared ZSM-5 zeolites were measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF) on a Bruker-AXS S4 Explorer. The BET surface areas and micropore volumes of the catalysts were analyzed by N2 adsorption at 196 C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. 27Al ma- gic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (27Al MAS NMR) measurements were performed on a Bruker DSX-300 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 78.2 MHz. Spectra were recorded at a spinning rate of 12 kHz, a pulse length of 0.31 ms and a delay time of 0.5 s. The samples were hydrated in a desiccator over a saturated NaCl solution for 3 days prior to the measurements. Scanning elec- tron microscopy (SEM) was recorded digitally on a Philips XL 30 microscope operating at 30 kV. Laser Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw inVia Reflex spectrometer using the 514.5-nm radi- ation of argon ion gas as an excitation source. The laser power was 20 mW, and the spectral resolution was 12 cm1. The Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature and under ambient conditions. Diffuse reflectance UVVis spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mea- surements were carried out on a PerkinElmer PHI 5000C spec- trometer with MgKa radiation as the excitation source. All binding energy values were referenced to the C1s peak at
284.6 eV. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles were
obtained on a Micromeritics AutoChem II apparatus loaded with 100 mg of catalyst. The TPR experiments were carried out in 10 vol.% H2/Ar flowing at 30 ml/min, with a ramping rate of 10 C/min. H2 consumption was monitored using a thermal con- ductivity detector. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was per- formed in air flow on a PerkinElmer 7 Series Thermal Analyzer apparatus to determine the amount of coke deposited on the cata- lyst after reaction.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests for propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 were performed at 550 C in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst load was 0.2 g, and it was pretreated at 550 C for 1 h in nitrogen flow prior to the reaction,unless otherwise stated. The gas reactant contained 2.5 vol.% pro- pane, 5 vol.% carbon dioxide and balancing nitrogen. The total flow rate of the gas reactant is 20 ml/min. The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed using an on-line GC equipped with a 6- m packed column of Porapak Q and a flame ionization detector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts. It is evident that both samples exhibit the charac- teristic reflections of the MFI topology [34]. The intensity of the dif- fraction peaks of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst is a bit lower than that of Cr/ ZSM-5-L, showing that the former catalyst has a slightly lower crystallinity. This observation can be interpreted by the occurrence of extinction effects caused by the coexistence of the crystallites with smaller sizes in the samples [35], as could be seen from SEM data presented as follows. No diffraction peaks corresponding to chromium oxide were observed, suggesting that chromium oxide is highly dispersed on the ZSM-5 support.
Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of the ZSM-5 supports.
Both ZSM-5 crystals are almost sphere-like, and the distribution of the crystallite size seems to be rather uniform. The average crys- tallite size is ca. 400 nm in diameter for ZSM-5-S. The ZSM-5-L zeo- lite has a much larger average crystallite size of ca. 2 lm.

195 27Al MAS NMR has been shown to be a powerful technique in the characterization of the local coordination environment of alu- minum atoms in zeolites [36,37]. Fig. 3 depicts the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the ZSM-5 supports. From the value of chemical shift (ppm), the coordination symmetry around Al sites can be identified. An intense signal at 55 ppm assigned to ZSM-5 frame- work aluminum atoms in tetrahedral coordination was observed for both samples. No discernable signal at 0 ppm attributed to ex- tra-framework aluminum atoms in octahedral coordination can be found. The NMR result implies that all of the Al atoms are located in the framework of the ZSM-5 zeolite.
The composition and textural properties of the supported chro- mium oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the bulk Si/Al ratio of the ZSM-5 supports measured by XRF is close to that of the initial gel, suggesting that a majority of added Al and Si species are incorporated into the framework of the ZSM-5 zeolite during the synthesis. As shown, both ZSM-5 zeolites have rather similar composition. The BET surface area and micropore volume of the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst are quite similar to those of Cr/ZSM-5-L. However, the former catalyst has a much greater external surface area as a result of its far smaller crystallite size,as revealed by the above SEM images.
Laser Raman spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the molecular nature of chromium species dispersed on the ZSM-5 zeolite. The Raman spectra of Cr/ZSM-5-S and Cr/ZSM-5-L samples are shown in Fig. 4. The strong sharp band at 551 cm1 can be com- monly attributed to crystalline Cr2O3 [3840]. Considering that crystals of Cr2O3 were not detected by XRD, laser Raman technique Fig. 1.

is more sensitive than XRD for the detection of Cr2O3 crystals over Cr/ZSM-5 catalysts. A similar observation was reported for chro- mium oxide supported on Al2O3 [41,42]. The broad bands centered around 858 and 991 cm1 observed under ambient conditions are ascribed to Cr(VI) species in the form of polymeric chromates [39,41]. It is obvious that the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst possesses a higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than Cr/ZSM-5-L.
Additional structural information on the surface chromium species can be obtained from UVVis diffuse reflectance measure- ments. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UVVis region of ZSM-5- supported chromium oxide catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. Both samples exhibit four bands in the range of 200850 nm. UV bands at 270 and 360 nm, which are assigned to O2 ? Cr6+ charge trans- fer transition of chromate species in tetrahedral coordination [23,4346], were mainly observed for both samples. The bands at 455 and 600 nm correspond to octahedral Cr3+ species in Cr2O3 or CrOx clusters [23,4346]. The UVVis spectra reflect the coexis- tence of both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species. It is clear that the ratio in the surface concentration of Cr(VI) species with respect to Cr(III) species is higher over Cr/ZSM-5-S than Cr/ZSM-5-L.
XPS was used to study the oxidation states of Cr. The XPS spec- tra were deconvoluted into two bands at about 576 and 579 eV as- signed to Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively [41,47,48]. For the sake of simplicity, only the quantitative data after fitting are presented in Table 2. It is obvious that the ratio of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is substan- tially higher on Cr/ZSM-5-S than Cr/ZSM-5-L, suggesting that the former catalyst has a much higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than the latter one. After the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 at 550 C for 8 h, the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ratio decreases markedly from 5.3 to 1.1, indicating that most Cr(VI) species were reduced to Cr(III) species in the reaction. A subsequent regenera- tion of the used catalyst by treatment in flowing air at 550 C for 2 h results in the sufficient recovery of the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ratio,pointing to a complete reoxidation of the reduced Cr(III) species to the original form.
To investigate the reducibility of the chromium species dispersed on the ZSM-5 zeolite, H2-TPR profiles of the supported Table 2 XPS data for ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts.

197 chromium oxide catalysts obtained between 150 and 750 C are compared in Fig. 6. Both samples exhibit only one reduction peak at ca. 400 C, which is attributed to the reduction of Cr(VI) species present on the ZSM-5-supported chromia samples [26,28,40,42,4951]. The rather similar peak temperature observed for both samples suggests that they have similar reducibility. How- ever, a much larger reduction peak was observed for Cr/ZSM-5-S than Cr/ZSM-5-L, pointing to far higher amount of Cr(VI) species in the former catalyst. This result is consistent with the above Raman, diffuse reflectance UVVis and XPS measurements. The much higher amount of Cr(VI) species observed on the Cr/ZSM-5- S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L could be related to a much greater external surface area of the former catalyst (Table 1) and a higher concentration of terminal silanol on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size [33].
3.2. Dehydrogenation of propane
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 over ZSM-5-supported chromia catalysts was investigated at 550 C. The results are given in Table 3. The major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the minor products are ethane,ethylene and methane. At the beginning of the reaction, the pro- pane conversion and propylene selectivity on Cr/ZSM-5-S and Cr/ ZSM-5-L catalysts are 48.3%, 86.0% and 11.3%, 92.8%, respectively.
At 8 h on stream, the values become 30.1%, 91.8% and 8.4%,
94.1%, respectively. The activity of the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst is ca.
4 times that of Cr/ZSM-5-L. It has been proposed that Cr(VI) species are responsible for the high catalytic activities of supported chro- mia catalysts in the light alkane dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant, and Cr(VI) monochromate is more active than Cr(III) polychromate [44,52]. Hence, the significantly higher propane con- version on the Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst than Cr/ZSM-5-L is a conse- quence of a much higher content of Cr(VI) species achieved on the former catalyst as suggested from the detailed characterization results presented above.
Fig. 7 depicts the catalytic performance of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst as a function of reaction time. Propane conversion decreases quickly in the initial 1 h, followed by a slow decrease with increas- ing reaction time, suggesting a deactivation of the catalyst. On the other hand, it is observed that the selectivity to propylene in- creases gradually, which is due to a decline in the amount of by- products, especially methane. Thus decreased propane conversion can be attributed to carbon deposition on the surface of the Cr/ ZSM-5-S catalyst, as confirmed by the TG analysis. The coke amount after 8 h reaction determined by TG is 0.6 wt.%. The XPS data show that the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ratio decreases by 79% after 8 h reaction (Table 2), pointing to a reduction of most Cr(VI) spe- cies to Cr(III) species in the reaction. Hence, besides the coke for- mation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the deactivation of dehydrogenation catalysis [44,52]. To further clarify that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is another reason for the catalyst deactivation, the performance of the Cr/ZSM-5-S cata- lyst was investigated after the pretreatment with hydrogen (10 vol.% H2/Ar, 450 C and 1 h). As shown in Fig. 7, compared to fresh Cr/ZSM-5-S, the H2-pretreated sample shows a distinct diminishment in propane conversion at the initial stage of the reaction but a relatively small decline in propane conversion from 5 to 8 h. This result confirms the conclusion that the reduction of Cr(VI) plays an important role for the deactivation of Cr/ZSM-5-S catalyst.
Attempt was also made to regenerate Cr/ZSM-5-S after 8 h on stream by re-calcination of the used catalyst in flowing air at 550 C for 2 h followed by purge with N2 for another 1 h (Fig. 8).
It is apparent that the original activity of Cr/ZSM-5-S could be fully restored, with no noticeable deactivation being detected even after the second regeneration. The full recovery of the activity after the air treatment is owing to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst as well as the complete reoxidation of the reduced Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species as revealed by the XPS result.
4. Conclusions
ZSM-5-supported chromium oxide catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness method. This study demonstrates that chro- mium oxide supported on Na-type ZSM-5 with smaller crystal size (ca. 400 nm) is a new attractive catalyst applicable for propane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. This catalyst exhibits sub- stantially higher activity than chromium oxide supported on ZSM- 5 with larger crystal size (ca. 2 lm). Combined Raman, diffuse reflectance UVVis, XPS and H2-TPR results demonstrate that the former catalyst has a much higher concentration of surface Cr(VI) species than the latter one, which accounts for its superior catalytic performance. In addition to the coke formation, the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is also responsible for the catalyst deactivation.
