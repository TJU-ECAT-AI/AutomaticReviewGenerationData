1.The literature does not provide information on how various support materials such as MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, ZrO2, and CeO2, influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It only discusses the effect of SiO2 and Al2O3 as supports. Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 enhances the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease. The effect of steam on catalytic performance of the tested catalysts was also discussed. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation. It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

1.文献没有提供关于MCM-41，H-ZSM-5，ZrO2和CeO2等各种支撑材料如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性，选择性，稳定性和机制途径的信息。它只讨论了SiO2和Al2O3作为支撑的影响。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2增强了丙烯产量，而在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，CO2存在时丙烯的产量和选择性明显降低。还讨论了蒸汽对测试催化剂催化性能的影响。在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上观察到CO2对丙烯产量的促进作用，而在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上，二氧化碳没有促进脱氢。看来，CO2和/或在与CO2脱氢过程中形成的蒸汽改变了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性。
