[1] "The support plays a significant role as it not only provides a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also over- come diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface, which are easily acces- sible for the reactants to adsorb."
[2] "In some instances, both the supported material and the support itself function as a catalyst."
[3] "Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst."
[4] "The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties."
[5] "The oxidic support is regarded as acidic when the surface oxygen atoms are electron-poor, and basic when they are electron-rich."
[6] "The rehybridization of the orbitals within the metal particle induced by bonding to the support sometimes results in an electron transfer between the support and the metal and a polarization of the metal particle by the electric field of the support or nearby cations, which influences the valence electron distribution within the metal particle."
[7] "Saito et al.28 have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene over vanadium, chromium and iron-based cata- lysts (Table 1) with and without a support."
[8] "The unsupported catalysts, V2O5, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 (Table 1, entries 1, 2, 7, 12 and 13), showed lower conversions compared to the supported catalysts."
[9] "In all the cases it was found that the acti- vated carbon (AC)-supported catalyst showed the highest conversion, which may be accredited to the high surface area of the catalysts (Table 1, entries 6, 11 and 17) and the high disper- sion of the metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface."
[10] "This comparison between the bulk metal oxide and the supported one clearly indicates the importance of the support in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[11] "The oxidized diamond (O-Dia)-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas (Table 1, entries 3, 8 and 14); however, there is a significant difference in the catalytic activities observed."
[12] "Two fold and one fold increases were observed compared to the bulk phase for V/O-Dia and Cr/O-Dia, respectively; whereas, in the case of Fe/O-Dia, a small increment in the activity was observed, which may be due to the chemisorbed oxygen species on diamond effecting the redox cycle of iron oxide."
[13] "These studies pointed toward the role of the support in the catalytic cycle of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with CO2."
[14] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehy- drogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."
[15] "Unsupported Cr2O3 showed much less activity than silica, alumina and zirconia- supported catalysts; whereas, over titania, the activity was much lower than unsupported Cr2O3."
[16] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."
[17] "The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."
[18] "The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."
[19] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."
[20] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."
[21] "Electron transfer should be easy on the unsupported chromia surface, occurring along the Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+ chains, which effect the reoxidation."
[22] "Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus,maintaining a better catalytic performance."
[23] "These studies suggest that the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts."

1.The support materials play a significant role in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help maintain highly dispersed active sites and overcome diffusion problems. The support can modify the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties, influencing the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The choice of support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst. For example, activated carbon-supported catalysts showed the highest conversion due to their high surface area and high dispersion of metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas but had significant differences in catalytic activities. The support can also affect the redox cycle of iron oxide. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia. The Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. In supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus maintaining a better catalytic performance. The phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts. The key challenges in optimizing their overall performance include maintaining high surface area, high dispersion of metal oxide, and preventing reoxidation while maximizing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

1.支撑材料在CO2氧化脱氢反应中起着重要作用，通过提供高表面积、固定化和孔隙度，有助于维持高度分散的活性位点并克服扩散问题。支撑材料可以通过其酸性或碱性性质修改分散活性位点的性质，影响金属颗粒内的价电子分布。支撑材料的选择可以对催化剂的性能产生重大影响。例如，活性炭支撑的催化剂由于其高表面积和金属氧化物的高度分散，表面有大量活性位点，因此表现出最高的转化率。氧化金刚石支撑的金属氧化物具有大约相同的表面积，但催化活性存在显著差异。支撑材料还会影响铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。支撑Cr2O3的催化性能更好，因为与纯铬酸盐相比，支撑铬氧化物催化剂的再氧化速率较低。支撑催化剂的Cr6+O键能高于未支撑铬酸盐，因为存在Cr6+OM键，这些键比未支撑Cr2O3中的Cr6+O Cr6+键更强。在支撑铬系统中，CrOx单元在支撑材料上隔离，氧气只能从有限数量的Cr离子转移到分子上，这可以防止再氧化，从而保持更好的催化性能。金属氧化物的相和分散度、使用的支撑类型、支撑的性质、MOM键强度的变化以及支撑催化剂中氧气转移的容易程度是影响这些氧化还原催化剂催化性能的因素。优化其整体性能的关键挑战包括保持高表面积、金属氧化物的高度分散，同时防止再氧化，同时最大化催化活性和选择性。
