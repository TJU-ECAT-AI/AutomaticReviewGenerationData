[1] "The support plays a significant role as it not only provides a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also over- come diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface, which are easily acces- sible for the reactants to adsorb."
[2] "In some instances, both the supported material and the support itself function as a catalyst."
[3] "Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst."
[4] "The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties."
[5] "The oxidic support is regarded as acidic when the surface oxygen atoms are electron-poor, and basic when they are electron-rich."
[6] "The rehybridization of the orbitals within the metal particle induced by bonding to the support sometimes results in an electron transfer between the support and the metal and a polarization of the metal particle by the electric field of the support or nearby cations, which influences the valence electron distribution within the metal particle."
[7] "Saito et al.28 have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene over vanadium, chromium and iron-based cata- lysts (Table 1) with and without a support."
[8] "The unsupported catalysts, V2O5, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 (Table 1, entries 1, 2, 7, 12 and 13), showed lower conversions compared to the supported catalysts."
[9] "In all the cases it was found that the acti- vated carbon (AC)-supported catalyst showed the highest conversion, which may be accredited to the high surface area of the catalysts (Table 1, entries 6, 11 and 17) and the high disper- sion of the metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface."
[10] "This comparison between the bulk metal oxide and the supported one clearly indicates the importance of the support in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[11] "The oxidized diamond (O-Dia)-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas (Table 1, entries 3, 8 and 14); however, there is a significant difference in the catalytic activities observed."
[12] "Two fold and one fold increases were observed compared to the bulk phase for V/O-Dia and Cr/O-Dia, respectively; whereas, in the case of Fe/O-Dia, a small increment in the activity was observed, which may be due to the chemisorbed oxygen species on diamond effecting the redox cycle of iron oxide."
[13] "These studies pointed toward the role of the support in the catalytic cycle of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with CO2."
[14] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehy- drogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."
[15] "Unsupported Cr2O3 showed much less activity than silica, alumina and zirconia- supported catalysts; whereas, over titania, the activity was much lower than unsupported Cr2O3."
[16] "The XRD and XPS measurements were unable to explain the significant difference in the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 over titania."
[17] "However, the temperature program reduction profiles clearly indicated a weak/insignificant peak of Cr2O3 supported on titania."
[18] "This suggests that the partial reduction of chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction (eqn (9)), which is not achieved when titania is used as a support."
[19] "Another reason that may account for the low activity of Cr2O3/TiO2 is that the reducible ions, Ti 4+, of the support may participate in the exchange of electrons between the distant Cr3+ ions which, in turn, effect the redox cycle."
[20] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability."
[21] "The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."
[22] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."
[23] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."
[24] "Electron transfer should be easy on the unsupported chromia surface, occurring along the Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+ chains, which effect the reoxidation."
[25] "Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus,maintaining a better catalytic performance."
[26] "These studies suggest that the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts are the factors that affect the catalytic performance of these redox catalysts."

Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus, maintaining a better catalytic performance. The key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance include the phase and dispersion of the metal oxide, the type of support used, the nature of the support, changes in the MOM bond strengths, and ease of oxygen transfer in supported catalysts.

1.支持材料在CO2氧化脱氢反应中起着重要作用，通过提供高表面积、固定化和孔隙度，有助于克服扩散问题，保持高度分散的活性位点，这些位点在表面的大部分区域易于吸附反应物。支持材料还可以通过其酸性或碱性性质修改分散活性位点的性质，影响金属颗粒内的价电子分布。氧化支持材料在表面氧原子电子不足时被认为是酸性的，在电子丰富时被认为是碱性的。金属颗粒与支持材料结合引起的轨道杂化有时会导致支持材料和金属之间的电子转移，以及支持材料或附近阳离子的电场对金属颗粒的极化，从而影响金属颗粒内的价电子分布。支持材料在CO2介导的氧化脱氢反应中对催化剂性能有重大影响。将块体金属氧化物与支持的金属氧化物进行比较，清楚地表明了支持材料在氧化脱氢反应中的重要性。氧化金刚石支持的金属氧化物具有大约相同的表面积，但观察到的催化活性有显著差异。金刚石上的化学吸附氧物种可以影响铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。铬的局部还原是氧化脱氢反应中红氧催化剂启动反应的首要要求，当使用二氧化钛作为支持材料时，这一要求没有实现。支持材料的可还原离子可能参与远处Cr3+离子之间的电子交换，从而影响氧化还原循环。在所有支持材料中，Cr2O3在SiO2上的支持表现出最高的乙烷转化率，最好的乙烯选择性和最好的稳定性。在乙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应中观察到以下活性顺序：Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2。支持的Cr2O3的催化性能更好，因为与纯铬酸盐相比，支持的铬氧化物催化剂的再氧化速率较低，这可能是由于CO2分子吸附的Cr3+中心的表面浓度较低。此外，支持催化剂的Cr6+O键能高于未支持的铬酸盐，这是由于存在Cr6+OM键，这些键比未支持的Cr2O3中的Cr6+O Cr6+键更强。电子转移在未支持的铬酸盐表面上应该很容易，沿着Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+链进行，从而影响再氧化。然而，在支持的铬系统中，CrOx单元在支持材料上被隔离，氧只能从有限数量的Cr离子转移到分子上，这可以防止再氧化，从而保持更好的催化性能。优化其整体性能的关键挑战和权衡包括金属氧化物的相和分散性、使用的支持材料类型、支持材料的性质、MOM键强度的变化以及支持催化剂中氧转移的容易程度。
