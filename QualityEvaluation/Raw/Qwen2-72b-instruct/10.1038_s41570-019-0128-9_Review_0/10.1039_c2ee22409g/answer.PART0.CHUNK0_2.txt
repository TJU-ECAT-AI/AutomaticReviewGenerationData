[1] "The support plays a significant role as it not only provides a high surface area, immobilization and porosity, but can also over- come diffusion problems by maintaining highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface, which are easily acces- sible for the reactants to adsorb."
[2] "In some instances, both the supported material and the support itself function as a catalyst."
[3] "Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the perfor- mance of the catalyst."
[4] "The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties."
[5] "The oxidic support is regarded as acidic when the surface oxygen atoms are electron-poor, and basic when they are electron-rich."
[6] "The rehybridization of the orbitals within the metal particle induced by bonding to the support sometimes results in an electron transfer between the support and the metal and a polarization of the metal particle by the electric field of the support or nearby cations, which influences the valence electron distribution within the metal particle."
[7] "Saito et al.28 have studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene over vanadium, chromium and iron-based cata- lysts (Table 1) with and without a support."
[8] "The unsupported catalysts, V2O5, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 (Table 1, entries 1, 2, 7, 12 and 13), showed lower conversions compared to the supported catalysts."
[9] "In all the cases it was found that the acti- vated carbon (AC)-supported catalyst showed the highest conversion, which may be accredited to the high surface area of the catalysts (Table 1, entries 6, 11 and 17) and the high disper- sion of the metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface."
[10] "The oxidized diamond (O-Dia)-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas (Table 1, entries 3, 8 and 14); however, there is a significant difference in the catalytic activities observed."
[11] "Two fold and one fold increases were observed compared to the bulk phase for V/O-Dia and Cr/O-Dia, respectively; whereas, in the case of Fe/O-Dia, a small increment in the activity was observed, which may be due to the chemisorbed oxygen species on diamond effecting the redox cycle of iron oxide."
[12] "Nakagawa et al. on the oxidative dehydrogena- tion of ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide over Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond evidenced a synergy between the support and Cr2O3, which promoted the catalytic performance."
[13] "A plausible interpretation of such a synergy between Cr2O3 and oxidized diamond revealed the fact that the production of ethane, Cr2O3 or a higher oxidation state of chromium oxides is required."
[14] "If chromium oxides are dispersed on the oxidized dia- mond surface, the chromium oxides might stabilize and become difficult to reduce."
[15] "Even if the chromium oxides are reduced with C2H6 or H2, they will be oxidized by CO2 or the oxygen species on the diamond surface."
[16] "Wang et al.67 investigated a comparative study on the dehy- drogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide over chromium oxide supported on silica, alumina, zirconia and titania to understand the support effect on the catalytic activity."
[17] "Unsupported Cr2O3 showed much less activity than silica, alumina and zirconia- supported catalysts; whereas, over titania, the activity was much lower than unsupported Cr2O3."
[18] "The XRD patterns of these catalysts were unable to distinguish between the phases of Cr2O3 on the supports as no peak corresponding to Cr2O3 was observed due to its fine dispersion."
[19] "The XPS measurements showed that the oxidation states of Cr2O3 over the supports were Cr3+ and Cr6+ ,with slight differences in the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios."
[20] "The XRD and XPS measurements were unable to explain the significant difference in the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 over titania."
[21] "However, the temperature program reduction profiles clearly indicated a weak/insignificant peak of Cr2O3 supported on titania."
[22] "This suggests that the partial reduction of chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction (eqn (9)), which is not achieved when titania is used as a support."
[23] "Another reason that may account for the low activity of Cr2O3/TiO2 is that the reducible ions, Ti 4+, of the support may participate in the exchange of electrons between the distant Cr3+ ions which, in turn, effect the redox cycle."
[24] "Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity and the best stability."
[25] "The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2."
[26] "Sloczynski et al.69 suggested that the catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place."
[27] "Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3."
[28] "Electron transfer should be easy on the unsupported chromia surface, occurring along the Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+ chains, which effect the reoxidation."
[29] "Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus,maintaining a better catalytic performance."

1.Various support materials, such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2, play a significant role in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by providing high surface area, immobilization, and porosity, which help to overcome diffusion problems and maintain highly dispersed active sites with large fractions on the surface. The support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst by modifying the properties of the dispersed active site through its acidic or basic properties. The oxidic support is regarded as acidic when the surface oxygen atoms are electron-poor, and basic when they are electron-rich. The rehybridization of the orbitals within the metal particle induced by bonding to the support sometimes results in an electron transfer between the support and the metal and a polarization of the metal particle by the electric field of the support or nearby cations, which influences the valence electron distribution within the metal particle. The support materials can also function as a catalyst in some instances. The choice of support for a particular metal oxide system is an important aspect in the determination of catalytic performance. The oxidized diamond-supported metal oxides showed approximately the same surface areas; however, there is a significant difference in the catalytic activities observed. The activated carbon-supported catalyst showed the highest conversion, which may be accredited to the high surface area of the catalysts and the high dispersion of the metal oxide with a large fraction of active sites on the surface. The oxidized diamond support and Cr2O3 showed a synergy that promoted the catalytic performance. The chromium oxides might stabilize and become difficult to reduce when dispersed on the oxidized diamond surface. Even if the chromium oxides are reduced with C2H6 or H2, they will be oxidized by CO2 or the oxygen species on the diamond surface. The chromium is a prime requirement for oxidative dehydrogenation over redox catalysts to initiate the reaction, which is not achieved when titania is used as a support. The reducible ions, Ti 4+, of the support may participate in the exchange of electrons between the distant Cr3+ ions, which, in turn, effect the redox cycle. Among all the supports, Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 exhibited the highest conversion of ethane, the best ethylene selectivity, and the best stability. The following order of activity was observed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2: Cr2O3/SiO2 > Cr2O3/ZrO2 > Cr2O3/Al2O3 > Cr2O3/TiO2. The catalytic performance of supported Cr2O3 was better due to the lower reoxidation rate of the supported chromium oxide catalysts as compared with pure chromia, which may be due to the lower surface concentration of the Cr3+ centers on which adsorption of the CO2 molecule takes place. Moreover, the Cr6+O bond energy is higher for the supported catalyst than for unsupported chromia due to the presence of Cr6+OM bonds, which are stronger than Cr6+O Cr6+ in unsupported Cr2O3. Electron transfer should be easy on the unsupported chromia surface, occurring along the Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+ chains, which effect the reoxidation. Whereas, in supported chromium systems, the CrOx units are isolated on the support and oxygen can be transferred to the molecule from only a limited number of Cr ions, which can prevent reoxidation, thus, maintaining a better catalytic performance.

1.各种支撑材料，如SiO2，MCM-41，H-ZSM-5，Al2O3，ZrO2和CeO2，在CO2氧化脱氢反应中起着重要作用，通过提供高表面积，固定化和孔隙度，有助于克服扩散问题并保持高度分散的活性位点，这些位点在表面上具有大量活性位点。支撑材料可以对催化剂的性能产生重大影响，通过其酸性或碱性性质改变分散活性位点的性质。氧化支撑材料在表面氧原子电子不足时被认为是酸性的，在表面氧原子电子丰富时被认为是碱性的。由支撑材料与金属颗粒之间的结合引起的轨道杂化有时会导致支撑材料和金属之间的电子转移以及支撑材料或附近阳离子的电场对金属颗粒的极化，这会影响金属颗粒内的价电子分布。在某些情况下，支撑材料本身也可以作为催化剂。对于特定金属氧化物系统，选择支撑材料是确定催化性能的重要方面。氧化金刚石支撑的金属氧化物具有大约相同的表面积；然而，观察到催化活性存在显著差异。活性炭支撑的催化剂显示出最高的转化率，这可能归因于催化剂的高表面积和金属氧化物的高分散度，以及表面上大量活性位点的存在。氧化金刚石支撑和Cr2O3显示出协同作用，促进了催化性能。当分散在氧化金刚石表面上时，铬氧化物可能稳定并变得难以还原。即使铬氧化物通过C2H6或H2还原，它们也会被CO2或金刚石表面上的氧物种氧化。铬是氧化脱氢反应中还原催化剂启动反应的首要要求，当使用二氧化钛作为支撑材料时，这一要求无法实现。支撑材料的可还原离子，Ti 4+，可能参与远处Cr3+离子之间的电子交换，从而影响氧化还原循环。在所有支撑材料中，Cr2O3在SiO2上的支撑表现出最高的乙烷转化率，最佳的乙烯选择性和最佳的稳定性。在CO2氧化脱氢反应中观察到以下活性顺序：Cr2O3/SiO2>Cr2O3/ZrO2>Cr2O3/Al2O3>Cr2O3/TiO2。支撑Cr2O3的催化性能更好，因为与纯铬酸盐相比，支撑铬酸盐催化剂的再氧化速率较低，这可能是由于CO2分子吸附的Cr3+中心的表面浓度较低。此外，支撑催化剂的Cr6+O键能高于未支撑铬酸盐，这是由于存在Cr6+OM键，这些键比未支撑Cr2O3中的Cr6+O Cr6+键更强。电子转移在未支撑的铬酸盐表面上应该很容易，沿着Cr3+O Cr6+OCr3+链进行，这会影响再氧化。然而，在支撑的铬系统中，CrOx单元在支撑材料上被隔离，氧气只能从有限数量的Cr离子转移到分子上，这可以防止再氧化，从而保持更好的催化性能。
