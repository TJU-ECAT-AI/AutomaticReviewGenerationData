Abstract 
Catalytic 
oxidation 
of C 1--C7 
alkanes by CO2 as a non-traditional 
oxidant was studied on oxide 
catalysts. 
The supported manganese 
oxide catalysts are the most active, selective and stable. Methane is converted mainly into synthesis gas. Ethane and propane 
give products of oxidative dehydrogenation. In the case of C4-C7 alkanes at first direct dehydrogenation takes place and after 
that reverse water gas shift proceeds. 
Reactions of carbon dioxide with hydrocarbons were up to now still insufficiently studied. This is caused by small reactivity 
of both CO2 and hydrocarbons. The recent interest in carbon dioxide reactions is two-fold: l) the necessity to fight against the 
so-called green-house effect and 2) the exhaustion of raw carbon material sources [ 1 
]. 
The CO2 molecule can be used a non-traditional oxidant. The best reducing agent for CO2 is hydrogen. It was shown [2] that 
methanol synthesis proceeds not by direct CO + H2 interaction, but by preliminary CO transformation into CO2 
CO + H20 = CO2 + H2 
( 1 
) 
After that the interaction of CO2 with H 
2 gives methanol 
CO2 + 3H2 = CH3OH + H20 
(2) 
But hydrogen is expensive. Hydrocarbons in the role of CO2 reductants are more attractive. 
The most intensively studied reaction of hydrocarbons with CO2 is methane conversion into synthesis gas 
CI-L + CO2 --- 
2H2 + 2CO 
(3) 
The main difficulty encountered when this reaction is used for the practical process of synthesis gas production is coking of the 
metal catalysts [3-6]. 
We have studied C~-C7 interaction with CO2 over oxide catalysts [7-10] and it turned out that manganese oxides containing 
catalysts are effective both for methane transformation into synthesis gas and for C2-C7 alkanes dehydrogenation and oxidative 
cracking. What is especially important is that these catalysts are very stable during a long period without cake accumulation. 
This paper provides a review of our work in this field. 
1. Methane conversion 
The interaction of methane with CO2 was stud- 
ied on different oxide catalysts [7-9]. Under sta- 
tionary conditions the 5%Ca- 12%Mn-O/A1203 
catalysts were the best ones. In the stationary state 
the reaction (3) of synthesis gas formation pro- 
ceeds. At 930°C complete CO2 and CH4 con- 
sumption reaches 99.7% with CO selectivity and 
84.6% with H E selectivity. The activity is stable

during a very long period and coke is not formed. 
An XRD study shows that oxidized Mn phases: 
Mn203 and Mn304 promote total methane oxida- 
tion while the reduced phases: MnO and MnCO3 
assist methane conversion into synthesis gas. A 
comparison of H2 formation in steady state con- 
ditions (3.10 -3 mol/g, hour at 870°C) and dur- 
ing the reduction of the catalyst by methane 
(1.7. l03 mol/g, hour) show that they are close 
to each other. Methane activation but not the CO2 
activation is the probable rate controlling step. The 
stationary MnO phase is stable during catalysts 
and prevents coking. The most probable scheme 
of CH4 conversion with CO2 is the following one:

where Pcn4, Pco, Pc02 are partial pressures of 
CH4, CO, CO2, correspondingly. This equation is 
different from the kinetic equations of reaction 
(3) for metallic catalysts [3]. 
The 1.5%K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/Si02 catalyst 
shows different properties. CO prevails in the 
reaction products in conformity with reaction (6) 
CH4 -t- 3CO 
2 --* 4CO + 2H20 
(6) 
Methane oxidative coupling, reaction (7) and (8) 
were also observed on some catalysts 
2CH4 + CO 
2 = C2H6 + CO + H20 
(7) 
C2H6 + CO2 = C2H4 + CO + H20 
(8) 
At 800°C A 
G for the reaction (7) is positive but 
not very high. The equilibrium yield of C2H6 at 
800°C is equal to 13% which is a high enough 
value. 
On the well known Li/MgO catalyst for meth- 
ane oxidative coupling both the methane oxidative 
coupling by CO2 with C2 hydrocarbons formation, 
reactions (7) and (8) and the synthesis gas for- 
mation (3) were observed. In the stationary state 
methane conversion at 800°C, V= 1800 hour- 
and CHJCO2 = 5 was 10.8% and the rate of syn- 
thesis gas formation was 2.5 times higher than that 
of ethylene formation. 
2. Ethane conversion 
During ethane interaction with CO2 both ethane 
oxidative dehydrogenation (8) and synthesis gas 
formation (9) proceed 
C2H6 q- 2CO2 -o 4CO + 3H2 
(9) 
The most active and stable catalysts for the reac- 
tions (8) and (9) were also manganese oxides 
based catalysts [7,10]. On the 17%MnO/SiO2 
catalyst C2I-I6 
conversion of 73.1% and CO2 con- 
version of 49.0% were observed at 800°C, 
V = 3600 hour- 1 
and CO:C:H6 = 1.5. C2H4 
selec- 
tivity was 61.0% and C2H 
4 yield = 44.5%. A sim- 
ilar catalyst supported on A1203 displayed a much 
lesser selectivity. On the nickel catalyst the 
C2H6+CO 2 reaction proceeds non-selectively 
with formation of CO, n 2 and coke. 
We have studied also the effect of modifying 
additions to Mn oxides of a series of oxides which 
are known as dehydrogenation catalysts (Sb, Zn, 
V, Fe, Cr oxides). The most active and selective 
catalyst for C2H 
4 production was found to be 
5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2. Further increase of 
selectivity was observed upon additional modifi- 
cation by alkali metal oxides. The 1.5%K- 
5.5%Cr-17%Mn-O/SiO2 
catalyst shows at 
830°C C2H 
6 conversion 82.6%, CO2 conversion 
55.7% and C2H4 selectivity 76.8%. 
The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by carbon 
dioxide is described by the equation (10) 
KiPczn6Ko~Pco2 
( 10 
) 
rc:n4 = KoxPco2 + KreaPco 
O. V. Krylov et al. /Catalysis Today 24 (1995) 371-375 
373 
where Kox and Krea are rate constants of the cata- 
lyst oxidation and reduction. The equation (10) 
describes the observed decrease of selectivity with 
conversion. This redox equation differs from the 
corresponding redox equation for alkane oxida- 
tion by oxygen where the denominator consists of 
the sum KoxPo2 -F KredPCnHm. 
The mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation by 
CO2 on the K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst can be 
presented by the scheme ( 11 )

The scheme ( ! 1 
) explains the higher yields of 
CO as compared to CH 
4 where the following CO/ 
H2 ratios were obtained: CO/H2 = 5-8 at 700°C 
and 1.5-2 at 830°C. This means that the role of 
the last reaction in the scheme ( 11 ), thermal dehy- 
drogenation, is relatively small. 
The redox mechanism of manganese carbonate 
decomposition on the phase boundary MnO-CrO 
seems to play here an important role.

The chromium oxide phase is reduced and oxi- 
dized and the manganese oxide takes part in the 
reoxidation by CO2. 
The sites basicity determines the stability of 
carbonate structure and, as a consequence, the 
degree of redox sites reoxidation. Basic sites of 
moderate basicity are necessary for CO2 absorp- 
tion and Cr 
3 
÷ reoxidation. 
3. Propane conversion 
Propane interaction with CO2 can proceed on 
different catalysts by three reactions 
C3H8 + CO2 --0 C3H 6 -+- 
CO -I- H20 
(13) 
2C3H8 + 2CO2 -+ 3C2H4 + 2CO + 2HzO 
(14) 
C3H8 + 3CO2 -o 6CO + 4H2 
(15) 
Manganese oxides were in this case also the most 
active and stable ones [ 8]. On nickel catalyst the 
CO2 conversion in an equimolar C3H 
8 q- CO2 mix- 
ture was at 750°C as high as 80-85%, but propane 
transforms into CO and H2 and the process is char- 
acterized by quick coking. 
The best catalyst for selective propane conver- 
sion with COz is also 1.5% K-5.5%Cr-17%Mn- 
O/SiO2. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830°C, 3600 
hour- 1 
and CO2/C3H 
8 is 73% (80% of its C2H4) , 
propane conversion is 96% and the ratio CO/ 
(CeHa+C3H6) = 1.4. At 800°C the ratio CO/ 
(C2H a-FC3H6) increases up to 4. With increase 
of conversion a considerable olefins selectivity 
decrease is observed. Such a trend can be 
explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon con- 
version and by production of a more reduced mix- 
ture than in the case of ethane. The amount of coke 
after a long period of steady state reaction does 
not exceed 3.6% in respect to the mass of the 
catalyst. 
The general trends of propane conversion with 
CO2 are similar to those for ethane transformation. 
The rate of selective transformation of C3H 
8 
with CO2 into ethylene is described by the equa- 
tion 
K1KredPc3nsKoxPco2 
FCzH4- 
(16) 
KredPco2 
+ KoxPco 
which is very similar to the equation (10). The 
rate of the catalyst reduction by C3H8 is 17 times 
less than the rate of the reduction by CO. 
4. Isobutane conversion 
The degree of C4Hlo dehydrogenation into 
C4H 8 is 19% at 665°C, but CO2 is not involved in 
374 
O. V. Krylov et al. / Catalysis Today 24 (1995) 371-375 
the reaction. The Cr-MnO/SiO2 catalyst is active 
for oxidative dehydrogenation by CO2. 
i-C4H~o 
+ CO2 = i-C4H8 + CO + H20 
(17) 
It shows C4Hlo conversion of 61-66%, CO2 con- 
version of 20-29.5 % and i-Call8 selectivity of 78- 
81%. CO and H2 are formed in equal amounts this 
being explained by the equilibrium reaction ( 1 
). 
The kinetic equation of the process has the form 
(18) similar to the Mars-Van Krevelen: 
K1Pi.c~-lloK2Pco2 
ri.c~v8 = KiPco2 + K2Pi-cJ-t,o 
(18) 
It differs from the equations (10) and (16) for 
ethane and propane. Thus the catalyst reduction 
by CO formed during the reaction is less signifi- 
cant than the catalyst reduction by isobutane. 
A study of the H2 + CO2 reaction on the same 
catalyst showed that the rate of CO formation is 
close to the rate of CO formation in steady state 
conditions of the reaction (17). The rate of CO 
formation during CO2 interaction with the reduced 
Cr- or Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst 
CO 
2 q- [] ~ CO --I- 
Oad 
c 
(19) 
is also considerably (10 times) less than the rate 
of CO formation in the steady state conditions. 
Thus the main route of the CO formation is 
reaction (1) and the reaction (17) proceeds 
mainly by two consecutive reactions 
i-C4Hlo ~ i-C4H8 + H2 
(20) 
CO2 + H2 ~ H20 + CO 
( 1 
) 
The hydrogen formed upon isobutane dehydro- 
genation is not oxidized completely; only about a 
half of the H2 participates in the subsequent CO2 
reduction in accordance with the equilibrium of 
the reaction ( 1 
) at 660°C. CO2 in the reaction ( 1 
) 
is transformed into CO not by the reaction (19) 
but probably through intermediate formation of 
HCOO- complex and its decomposition into 
CO + OH-. A special investigation showed that 
small additions of hydrogen (1-3%) to CO2 
increased 8-15 times the rate of CO2 interaction 
with surfaces. 
The simultaneous formation of isobutylene and 
synthesis gas upon interaction of isobutane with 
CO2 allows to propose a new process for the pro- 
duction of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE)

5. Conversion of n-heptane 
Heavy alkanes are subject mainly to oxidative 
cracking upon interaction with CO 2 over manga- 
nese oxide catalysts. The reaction n-C7H16 
+ CO 
2 
was studied on the K-Mn-O/AI203, La-Mn-O/ 
A1203 and La-Mn-O/NaY catalysts at 540- 
670°C [10]. La-Mn-O/AI203 was the most 
active in CO2 activation. CO and H2 are formed 
over La-Mn-O/AI203 and K-Mn-O/AI203 in 
equal amounts. 
The rate of CO formation in the reaction (1) 
was somewhat 
lower than the rate of CO formation 
in the reaction C7H16 + CO 
2. The rate of CO for- 
mation in the steady state conditions was 14 times 
higher than in conditions of the catalyst reoxida- 
tion. This means that the oxidation of the catalyst 
takes place.

The oxidative cracking of 
n-heptane upon inter- 
action with CO2 can be described by the general 
equations 
C7H16 -" c4ns + C3H6 + H2 
C7H16 ~ 3C2H4 + C + 2H2 
H2 + CO2 ~ H20 + CO

6. Conclusion 
The results described above obtained during the 
investigation 
of the reaction of C1-C7 alkanes with 
CO2 on oxide catalysts show different mecha- 
nisms for lower and higher alkanes. The reaction 
RH + CO2 proceeds by redox mechanisms, but 
CO2 activation can take place in direct interaction 
with the reduced oxide or in the formation of inter- 
mediate complexes, or in CO2 interaction with 
coke at the surface. 
Oxygen removal from the catalyst in the case 
of CH 
4 proceeds by direct interaction of the cata- 
lyst with the hydrocarbon. The CH4 molecule in 
split into Cadc 
+ 4Hadc (or 2H2). 
In the case of C2H 
6 and C3H 
8 the oxygen 
removal takes place as a result of the catalyst inter- 
action both with CnHm 
and with H2 split from the 
alkane molecule. 
At C > 4 direct dehydrogenation with subse- 
quent hydrogen oxidation by H2 prevails. At C > 6 
the oxidative function of the catalyst leads also to 
coke oxidation with CO2 participation. 
The indispensable requirement is the selection 
of a system which absorbs and activates CO2. The 
acidic properties of CO2 necessitate the choice of 
a catalyst with basic properties. But alkaline and 
alkaline earth oxides are ineffective because of 
strong carbonate formation. Oxides of moderate 
basicity are necessary and moreover they must 
participate in a redox process with CO2 reduction. 
Manganese oxides and possibly rare earth oxides 
satisfy this requirement.
