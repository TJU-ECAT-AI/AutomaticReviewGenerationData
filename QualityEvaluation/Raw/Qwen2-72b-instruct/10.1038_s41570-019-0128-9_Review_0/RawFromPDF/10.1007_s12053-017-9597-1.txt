Abstract
Energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generally aim to (i) reduce energy use and hence emissions, (ii) steer consumers away from fossil fuels and/or electricity generated from fossil fuels, and (iii) align demand and supply, making sure that the existing infrastructure can handle times of high demand. Policies thus include a variety of pricing schemes, taxes on energy inputs, energy efficiency standards and incentives, and renewables standards and incentives. Ex ante and ex post analyses of their effectiveness thus rely crucially on understanding how consumers respond to pricing schemes, taxes, and other policies. This paper presents an overview of the challenges faced when empirically estimating household energy demand. It describes the difficulties associated with estimating the price elasticity of demand, discussing behavioral responses that may make consumers relatively insensitive to price changes or taxes. It also surveys empirical evidence about non-price policies, such as clearer information or real-time feedback about energy use, and appeal to norms. The paper concludes discussing evidence about the rebound effect, the energy efficiency gap, and how suppliers respond to a variety of policies.

Introduction
This paper surveys recent literature about the energy use of households and household response to policies meant to improve energy efficiency and/or reduce energy use (and the associated greenhouse gas emissions). Attention is restricted to residential energy use (electricity and heating fuels) and private passenger cars. In the USA alone, residential and commercial buildings account for some 39% of energy use and CO2 emissions, and the transportation sector is responsible for approximately 20–30% of CO2 emissions in developed countries.

Energy and greenhouse gas emissions policies generally have one or more of three major goals. They seek to (1) reduce energy use and hence emissions, even if the fuels used to generate energy remained the same, (2) steer consumers away from fossil fuels and/or electricity generated from fossil fuels, encouraging the adoption of renewables, and (3) align demand and supply, making sure that the existing infrastructure can handle times of very high demand without interruptions in service.
They thus include taxes on energy inputs and the carbon tax, pricing schemes (time out use, real-time pricing, block pricing, which are often applied with residential electricity and gas supply), energy efficiency policies (which are comprised of energy efficiency standards, incentives, information-based approaches), and renewables policies (which can likewise comprise standards and incentives).
The purpose of this paper is to describe recent empirical work on some of these policies, troubleshooting difficulties and highlighting state-of-the-art practices. Much of the empirical work covered in this paper reveals that sometimes the policies do not work as well as intended, or unleash strategic and behavioral reactions that diminish their effectiveness.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Estimating energy demand” section reviews the basics of household energy demand, and “Empirically estimating energy demand functions” section the relevant empirical approaches. “The role of taxes: salience” section discusses salience and “Response stickiness” section alternate theoretical frameworks that can explain slow or no response to policies. “Non-price instruments” section discusses non-price approaches, including information feedback and norms, and “The rebound effect” section the rebound effect, which may erode the gains from energy efficiency upgrades. “Is the energy efficiency gap real” section briefly reviews recent literature that questions that there actually is an energy efficiency gap, and “Supplier’s responses” section supplier responses. “Concluding remarks” section concludes.
Estimating energy demand
A simple theoretical framework recognizes that people do not demand energy per se. Rather, they combine energy inputs and energy-using capital (such as boilers, appliances, and lighting fixtures) to produce energy services (a warm home, meals, clean clothes, lighting), and derive utility from the energy services. Formally, the household’s utility function is
$$ U\left(X, ES(E)\right) $$ (1)
where X represents consumption of all other goods and ES energy services, which depend on energy inputs E. Equation (1) assumes that energy-using capital is given and fixed. The household maximizes utility with respect to a budget constraint that states that income must be spent on aggregate consumption and energy inputs:
$$ y=X+{p}_E\cdot E, $$ (2)
where p E is the price of each unit of energy input and the price of all other consumption goods is normalized to one. From this, we derive a household demand for energy, which depends on income and the price of energy, given the existing level of energy-using capital:
$$ {E}^{\ast }={E}^{\ast}\left(y,{p}_E\right). $$ (3)
A slightly more elaborate model lets ES be a function of energy inputs E and capital, and, on assuming that the utility is separable in energy services and all other consumption goods, results in a two-stage budgeting problem, where in the first stage the household decides how much income to spend on consumption goods and how much on energy, and in the second stage it allocates energy expenditures between capital equipment and energy inputs.
2
Elegant as this model might be, it is unlikely to provide a good description of how people make energy-using decisions. For starters, it assumes that people are perfectly aware of prices and use exactly the desired amount of energy. But only recently, thanks to technological advances (smart meters, in-home displays, and other sophisticated monitoring equipment), and for a limited number of households, has it been possible for consumers to watch closely how much electricity they are using.
Moreover, electricity is different from most other goods, in that one first uses it and then pays for it, sometimes a long time later (i.e., one receives a bill at the billing period, which can cover a month, 2 months, or a quarter, depending on the location and the utility). This delay between use and payment is sometimes blamed for wasteful use and for lack of attention to consumption, the equipment that is responsible for it, and potential savings made possible by energy efficiency improvements.
Despite these concerns, the abovementioned models make it clear how policies can be used to influence energy demand: The price of the energy inputs can be raised to reduce demand (through taxes or administrative fiat), energy efficiency standards can be introduced so that the household production function ES( ) is modified, and/or incentives can be offered that lower the price of energy-efficient capital.
Empirically estimating energy demand functions
Equation (3) and two-stage budgeting models result in stylized demand functions meant to provide guidance for any actual empirical work. In practice, analysts typically seek to estimate household demand functions for either energy inputs or energy services. One is modeling energy inputs when the household’s electricity or natural gas consumption (annual or per billing period), or its log transformation, is the dependent variable in a regression model. The independent variables include (log) price, (log) price of a substitute fuel, (log) income, weather, and characteristics of the dwelling and the household that influence the demand for energy inputs. An example of demand for energy services might be a regression where the dependent variable is (log) kilometers driven and the independent variables are the (log) price of fuel per kilometer (which is obtained combining the price of motor fuel at the pump and the vehicle’s fuel economy), (log) income, and other location and household characteristics.
It is clear that both types of demand function should rely on the best data available. With residential energy consumption, it is very difficult to measure energy services reliably, but energy inputs are metered by the utilities, which in some cases make them available to researchers (e.g., Allcott 2011; Ito 2014; Alberini and Towe 2015; Jessoe and Rapson 2014). In other cases, consumption is constructed from the energy bills, combined with exact information about pricing schedules (Alberini et al. 2011; Gans et al. 2013).
Personal transportation surveys in many countries collect information about the number, type, fuel economy, and other characteristics of the vehicles owned or leased by a household, along with the kilometers driven in the last 12 months (which many drivers easily keep track of using the odometer) and the trips taken during the day of the survey or a few days prior to the survey. (This is usually done through detailed diaries.)
The effect of many policies can be predicted if an all-important parameter is known—the price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity of demand, namely the percent change in energy inputs or energy services associated with a 1% change in the price of the energy input, is empirically estimated by taking advantage of the variation in prices across units or over time. Miller and Alberini (2016) review recent estimates of the price elasticity of residential electricity demand, finding that they cover a wide range (from 0, which means that the demand is completely inelastic, to − 2), but that the bulk of the estimates suggest a relatively low elasticity. The wide range is probably attributable to the large variety of locales where the studies were conducted, the nature of the data (cross-section, time series, or panel), the different years in which the data were collected, whether prices were increasing or decreasing at the time of the study, whether the sample was comprised of low or high income households, difference in climate, whether substitute fuels are available and their prices, etc.
In practice, however, estimating price elasticities is fraught with difficulties. One major hurdle is the fact that in many cases, the researcher only has average prices charged to consumers in a geographical area or service territory of the utility. But if individual households face different prices (because they perhaps took advantage of special offers, are a protected category, or the utility applies block pricing), then price is measured with an error. Standard econometric theory shows that if the measurement error is classical (uncorrelated with the true price and uncorrelated with any other term in the econometric model of demand), then the estimated price elasticity is biased towards zero. In other words, “attenuation bias” will make the demand function appear more inelastic than it truly is.
In other cases, the price (whether marginal or average) is endogenous with the quantity consumed. This is the case with two-part tariffs and block pricing, two price schemes commonly used with electricity and gas. Under two-part tariffs, households are charged a fixed fee F in every billing period, and then a specified price p per kilowatt-hour or unit of natural gas. It is clear that the marginal price is p, while the average price is (F + p⋅q)/q if q is the quantity consumed. The average price is thus p + F/q, which makes it clear that the average price depends on q and that the larger the quantity consumed, the lower the average price is (Fig. 1).

Utilities have used increasing block pricing schemes extensively as an incentive to conservation. With increasing block pricing, the first q1 units consumed are charged price p1 per unit. The interval between 0 and q1 is denoted as the first block. If consumption q is greater than q1 and falls in the second block (q1 < q ≤ q2), the excess (q − q1) is charged price per unit p2 > p1. In this case, the bill is p1⋅q1 + (q − q1)⋅p2, the marginal price is p2 and the average price is p1⋅q1/q + (q − q1)⋅p2./q, i.e., a weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights mirror the share of q that q1 accounts for. It is straightforward to show that the average price increases with q. Figure 2 displays the marginal and average price, assuming two blocks, with the cutoff q1 between and the first and second block at 700 kWh per month. Marginal price is likewise endogenous with consumption, because marginal price is p1 if q ≤ q1 and p2 otherwise.

How is this endogeneity between price and consumption handled? By instrumenting for the price, which can be done using one of two possible approaches. McFadden et al. (1977) suggest running a regression of consumption on exogenous factors such as dwelling and family characteristics and forming predicted consumption. Using the actual block pricing scheme, the analyst computes what the applicable marginal price would be. This is regarded as an instrumented price, which replaces the true marginal price in the subsequent regression of consumption on price and other determinants of demand.
Alternatively, Nieswiadomy and Molina (1989) propose the set of prices that apply in each block as instruments for the actual marginal or average price faced by a household. Assuming that these vary over time or across households, one can deploy standard instrumental variable estimation techniques to arrive at consistent estimates of the parameter on price.
But which price is the appropriate price to use when estimating a demand function—marginal price (as suggested by theory) or average price? The question clearly matters when these two prices are different. Borenstein (2009) argues that if people respond to the marginal price, then we would expect “bunching” (i.e., a spike in the frequency of consumption levels) at the cutoff between one block and the next.
Ito (2014) takes advantage of the boundary between two utilities that serve Orange County in Southern California (Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric). The two utilities charged different tariffs and changed them at a different rate over time, providing a natural experiment, as households living on either side of the boundary are very similar. The boundary between the service territories of the two utilities exists purely for historical reasons and indeed is within the same city.
Ito uses monthly bills and usage records from 1999 to 2009, finding that the histogram of the usage levels is smooth and displays no evidence of bunching at the block thresholds. Moreover, he formally estimates a demand function, showing that once one controls for average price, marginal price and expected marginal price are no longer significant. He further uses graphical analysis and predictions from the econometric model to show that, if people respond to average price, they consume more electricity than if they had responded to marginal price. He concludes that, despite its widespread application, increasing block pricing does not promote conservation if people respond to average price rather than the marginal price.
Jessoe and Rapson (2014) look at responsiveness to price in a different setting. Specifically, they examine critical peak pricing, an approach whereby during extremely high-demand episodes (as is the case during unusually hot summer days or certain winter days) the utility charges extremely high prices for every kilowatt-hour used or for every kilowatt-hour that exceeds a specified level. Jessoe and Rapson take advantage of a randomized control trial in Connecticut, and the fact that some of the households were randomly assigned to the critical peak pricing treatment, while others were assigned to critical peak pricing combined with in-home displays (IHDs), which facilitate keeping track of consumption in real time. With evidence from six critical peak pricing events in the summer, they find that the group assigned to the price-only treatment reduced electricity usage by between 0 and 7% with respect to the control group, whereas the group assigned to the price plus IHD was able to reduce electricity usage by 8–22%. They further find that the reduction in electricity use extend to non-peak times and off-summer days.
The role of taxes: salience
Since using fossil fuels generates externalities like air pollution, GHGs emissions, and reliance on imports, then an obvious remedy is to raise their prices in hopes of discouraging consumption. This is often accomplished through excise taxes. Indeed, OECD (2017) reports that in many developed countries excise taxes account for a large share of the price of motor fuels.

But is the imposition of tax really registered as a change in price by most individuals? Chetty et al. (2009) explore the notion of salience, namely what parts of a price change or tax is meaningful to and noticed by people. They take advantage of the fact that, in the USA, many states impose sales taxes, but the prices posted in the stores do not typically include such sales taxes, which are levied at the cash register. (This is not the case in Europe, where all prices are inclusive of VAT.) They devise an experiment which they conduct at supermarkets. In supermarkets randomly selected out of those that participated in the experiment, Chetty et al. manipulate the price tag on common toiletry items so that shoppers can see the pre-tax price and the final price, inclusive of tax. The price tags are unaltered in the remainder of the supermarkets. They find that when people are shown the price inclusive of the tax, sales decrease by some 8% with respect to the usual level measured at stores with unaltered tags. Had the consumer taken the tax into account in the first place, even when not explicitly reminded, there would have been no effect on the sales.
Another example of salience is provided by Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) who examine the impact of incentives offered in different forms on hybrid vehicle purchases. They compare sales tax rebates applied at the time of the purchase (and thus presumably highly salient) with income tax credits. Income tax returns are filed later (generally once a year on or before April 15) and so at the time of the purchase income tax credits are much less obvious and transparent than sales tax rebates. They find that the sales tax rebate has an effect on the sales of hybrid vehicle that is seven times as large as that of an equivalent income tax credit.
Response stickiness
There are a number of reasons why policies that seek to alter the excise tax of fuels and energy inputs are not always successful, or do not elicit immediate response. Consider for example habit formation theory. With habit formation, entities engage in an intertemporal utility optimization problem. In each period, utility depends on current consumption (g t) and on the habit stock (s t). The habit stock decays in each period and is replenished with each new period’s consumption:
$$ {s}_t=\alpha {g}_{t-1}+\left(1-\alpha \right){s}_{t-1} $$ (4)
where α = 1 means short memory, and α ≠ 0 is interpreted as a habits-as-durables model. When the utility optimization problem is solved, demand depends on past consumption of the fuel or energy input and on all of the future prices of the fuel or energy input. This model explains why people start reducing consumption now if they expect permanent price increases in the future and why consumption may fail to adjust to price increases if these are perceived to be just temporary. If people expect a tax increase to be repealed by a subsequent administration, they will not reduce consumption. Allcott and Wozny (2014) find that car markets respond to changes in gasoline prices with up to a 6-month delay.
Non-price instruments
Are there any non-price instruments that can get people to change their energy use? Many observers believe that if people received their energy bill more frequently and information about usage and prices were displayed more clearly, this would help avoid wastage and reduce consumption through conservation or the purchase of more energy-efficient appliances. The notion that providing instant feedback can help household self-regulate electricity and gas consumption is relied upon, among others, by the European Union, which calls for smart meter installation based on an analysis of the benefits and costs associated with their usage.

Faruqui et al. (2010) survey studies that have examined how in-home displays can help people keep track of their consumption of electricity and reduce it. They conclude that the evidence points to a 0–16% reduction attributable to such devices. Darby (2006) notes however that for certain segments of the population in-home displays actually result in an increase in consumption. This is the case when poor households or persons who were very parsimonious in their usage (for fear of running large bills) keep an eye on usage in real time and realize that they are on track with respect to planned expenditure. This allows them to increase consumption slightly to improve comfort.
Gans et al. (2013) exploit a natural experiment in Northern Ireland, where in 2002 the local utility replaced all meters to its pre-payment customers, replacing them with a smart device that allowed households to check electricity usage in real time, remaining credit available, an estimate of how soon that would be depleted, etc. Depending on the window around this event, Gans et al. find that pre-payment households were able to reduce consumption by 10–17% compared to the other households.
Finally, much attention has been paid to the effect of “norms” on consumption. Opower, a company based in the Washington, DC, area, specializes working on behalf of the utilities and mailing “customized” or modified bills that contain messages or images meant to signal consumer when they are using too much or, conversing, sparingly, in hopes of eliciting the customers’ response to comply with norms. For example, bills can tell people that they are “using X% more energy than their neighbors” and/or show a frowning face, or “that are using less their neighbors” and display a smiling face. Studies in other disciplines have found that people tend to reduce consumption when they are told that they do worse than most, but increase it when they are told that they are using less than others. In other word, people tend to conform to the majority or to what is perceived as the norm. Indeed, using large-scale Opower mailings that randomly assign positive and negative reinforcement messages to customers, Allcott (2011) and Allcott and Wozny (2014) find a modest and temporary effect on consumption. They find that people must be reminded constantly for the energy-saving efforts to be maintained.
The rebound effect
The rebound effect erodes the efficiency gains from adopting more energy efficiency technologies. Economic theory predicts that, in the absence of any behavioral changes, energy use should decrease in proportion to an improvement in energy efficiency (Sorrell et al. 2009). In the presence of the rebound effect, the reduction in energy inputs will be less than proportional to the improvement in energy efficiency. The rebound effect was first discussed by Jevons in 1865, and is easily explained by economic theory. Improvements in energy efficiency lower the price per unit of energy services, and so the demand for energy services increases. This will lead to a somewhat larger use of energy input than if there had been no adjustment in demand. It can be shown that the effect depends on the price elasticity of the demand for the energy input (Sorrell et al. 2009), and indeed the extent of the rebound effect is often estimated using the price elasticity of demand. Household demand for electricity, natural gas, or motor fuels, however, tends to be relatively inelastic, and thus one expects the rebound effect to be small.
5
Sorrell et al. (2009) review 17 studies and report a 3–87% range of effects, but point to the 10–30% range as the most credible one. Gillingham et al. (2013) note that the rebound effect (direct, indirect, or overall) is generally overstated, and that we do not generally know how the various types of effects will reinforce or offset each other. They also note that the overall effect is likely to be small and no larger than 30%.
Linn (2013) uses a single cross-section of households covered by the Household Transportation Survey in the USA, and estimates a demand for vehicle miles traveled (VMT), allowing for the VMT to respond differently to changes in the price of gasoline and diesel fuels. The price of a mile traveled is the price of gasoline divided by the fuel economy (expressed in miles per gallon, as is the custom in the USA), and Linn, on recognizing that people may choose cars with better fuel economy because they need to drive a lot, instruments for each vehicle’s fuel economy. He finds that people respond more to changes in fuel economy than changes in prices, and estimates the rebound effect to be 20–40%.
6
Frondel and Vance (2013) use the German Mobility Panel from 1997 to 2009, focusing on the subsample of households who (i) has a single car, and (ii) kept it for the three consecutive years in which they participated in the survey. They exploit changes in the price of gasoline, which will change the price per kilometer even if the car, and presumably its fuel economy, stays the same, but argue that the rebound effect will be revealed only when motor fuel prices are decreasing. They fit a log-log vehicle kilometers traveled equation that allows for two terms in price: One for when the price is increasing and one for when the price is decreasing. The coefficient on the latter identifies the rebound effect, which is quite pronounced (46–70%).
In general, I am skeptical of many studies that have examined the rebound effect, due to econometric and data issues. For starters, many of these studies are cross-sectional (e.g., Linn 2013) because that is typically the nature of most government-conducted personal transportation surveys. Second, even with a panel dataset (e.g., the German Mobility Panel), one needs sufficient car turnover and sufficient variation in fuel prices to be able to identify the effect. Frondel and Vance base their conclusions on pooled OLS estimation and random-effects models, which are likely to give inconsistent estimates in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated with the regressors included in the model.
Third, one thing is the manufacturer- or government-agency certified fuel economy, which refers to a new vehicle driven under ideal conditions, and another is the actual fuel economy as vehicles are driven on real roads and are in different maintenance conditions. Fourth, most studies ignore the fact that the fuel economy is endogenous with miles driven, as it stands to reason that someone that needs to drive a lot should want to purchase a vehicle with better fuel economy. Linn (2013) is one exception. Finally, many studies estimate the rebound effect from the price elasticity of energy or motor fuel demand, and fail to recognize that this could be different if estimating during period of rising or declining prices. Presumably people who have already invested in energy efficiency equipment would respond little to price drops. Frondel and Vance (2013) are an exception, in that they explicitly consider asymmetric effects.
In practice, even when attention is restricted to the direct rebound effect, there is considerable disagreement on what should be considered the rebound effect and what should be considered a change in the size of energy-using capital (Turner 2013). Alberini et al. (2016b) examine evidence from households in Maryland that use exclusively air-source heat pumps to heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer. These households therefore have no or negligible use of other energy inputs, and their electricity usage levels tend to be high (even 18–19,000 kWh/year, which is almost twice as much as the average American household). Air-source heat pumps are, however, subject to energy efficiency standards. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires that as of 2006 heat pumps be manufactured with a seasonally adjusted energy efficiency ratio of at least 13 and a heat seasonal performance factor of at least 8.
Alberini et al. have detailed monthly electricity meter readings for some 53 households, both before and after an existing heat pump was replaced with a new one, and for 282 households where the heat pump was not changed. Some 72% of those who did change the heat pump received a rebate from the local electric utility or a tax credit from the state or federal government, or both. Using a difference-in-difference regression setup, Alberini et al. find that, all else the same, those who changed their heat pump reduced electricity by 8% on average. This figure however masks a large difference across those who did and did not receive rebates or tax credits. The former did not reduce electricity usage at all. The latter reduced it by 16%. Survey data indicate that many households use the rebate and other forms incentives to finance the purchase of a larger and more powerful heat pump system. The energy efficiency rating of the new heat pumps was roughly the same across those who did and did not receive incentives, suggesting that this effect was engendered by an increase in capital stock combined with behavioral responses to an apparent reduction in the cost of energy services.
Is the energy efficiency gap real?
Research and policy circles have discussed for a few decades the so-called energy efficiency gap, namely the supposedly sluggish pace at which energy-efficient technologies are adopted, even if they make economic sense (Jaffe and Stavins 1994). Golove and Eto (1996) review possible explanations for it, including (i) high discount rates (which would lead individuals to dismiss the future savings in energy bills), (ii) lack of information, and (iii) institutional disincentives, among others.
Hassett and Metcalf (1993) propose an alternative interpretation: They note that such behavior is optimal when there is much uncertainty about future energy prices (or the taxes imposed on energy inputs). Under these circumstances, it is optimal for people to wait until they learn prices and trends—in other words, to wait until the uncertainty is resolved—before they invest in energy efficiency upgrades.
Allcott and Greenstone (2012) likewise question the existence of an energy efficiency gap. For example, they note that the high discount rates presumably exhibited by people when they choose equipment that is cheaper to purchase but less energy efficient are similar to the interest rates paid on credit card purchases, etc.
Most recently, Fowlie et al. (2015) have to come to another conclusion yet—that people do not make energy-efficient upgrades simply because they do not provide savings sufficient to justify the upfront costs. They conduct a randomized controlled trial among low-income households in Michigan. After an enhanced effort to get households to participate in the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), they only reach a 6% participation rate, compared to the 1% in the control group that was not targeted by this effort. This was accomplished at a cost of $1000 per contacted household. Fowlie et al. found that the WAP interventions reduced monthly energy usage by 10–20%, a much smaller saving than the engineering projections (25–50%). The upfront investments were twice as expensive as the (discounted) realized energy savings.
Suppliers’ responses
Another reason why some policies aimed at consumer may give mixed results is because suppliers’ responses have reduced their effectiveness. Producers may get around regulations and standards, rendering them ineffective. They may also raise prices and/or target products to take advantage of consumers who care about fuel economy, emissions, efficiency, and conservation.
Evidence about these behaviors is especially compelling with automobiles. In the USA, for example, policy has focused primarily on regulating the fuel economy of vehicles, which is more effective than raising the price of motor fuel through taxes if consumers undervalue the fuel economy of cars (Anderson et al. 2011; Allcott and Wozny 2014; Sallee et al. 2016). If tightening fuel economy standards raises production costs for automakers, upon facing higher new car prices consumers may decide to keep their old, less fuel-efficient, and higher-emitting cars longer. This is an example of the so-called new source bias first described in Gruenspecht (1982) and also found in Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015). But this is only one of the many possible unintended effects of regulations that defeat the purpose of the regulations themselves.
Fact 1. When possible, suppliers will get around rules and regulations
Sallee and Slemrod (2012) study the automakers’ response to the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1993, which credits vehicles with flex-fuel capability (i.e., equipped to run on both gasoline and E85, an ethanol-gasoline mix) with two thirds more than the miles-per-gallon fuel economy they actually achieve. They show that the US automakers did in fact exploit this loophole at very low cost to them. They find that flex-fuel vehicles were sold at the same price as regular-fuel vehicles to consumers that most likely did not know they were buying flex-fuel vehicles in the first place. There is no other explanation for the fact that flex-fuel vehicles were sold to consumers who lived very far away from E85 refueling stations. The cost of producing a flex-fuel car is estimated to be $9 to $27 per vehicle, showing that the cost of meeting fuel economy standards is not as high as the automakers would like the regulator to believe.
Ito and Sallee (2013) provide another example. In Japan, automakers are required to comply to fuel economy regulations. The fuel economy standards are progressively more lenient as the weight of the vehicle increases, but the fuel economy requirement is a step function of car weight and is thus flat within each car weight interval designated by the regulator. Ito and Sallee show that automakers “bunch” models at the cutoff between one weight category and the next, with a spike in the number of models slightly at the right of each cutoff, i.e., as soon as the less stringent standard applies. Presumably, this can be accomplished with minimal “tinkering” of the characteristics of the vehicle, and thus allows the automakers to avoid penalties at very low cost to them. The phenomenon is even more visible after the 2013 change in standards.
Fact 2: Manufacturers will raise price of energy-efficient products if they can
Houde (2014a, b) examines the Energy Star certification awarded to appliances by the US EPA and DoE. Houde provides evidence that appliance manufacturers “bunch” at efficiency rates that just barely meet the Energy Star requirements and take advantage of consumers by charging higher prices for those appliances.
Alberini et al. (2016a) examine the effects of the Swiss fuel economy label on the prices of cars that make the best “grade.” The Swiss fuel economy label was introduced in 2003. Its format (Fig. 3) is similar to that of many appliances and homes in the European Union. In addition to summarizing the mean features of the car, the label shows the car’s fuel economy (expressed in liters of fuel per 100 km), the car’s letter grade (where A is best and G is worst), and compares this car to the other new cars sold in Switzerland. The letter grade assigned to a car is based on its rating score, which is a weighted average of the car’s consumption rate (in liters per 100 km) and the car’s relative consumption rate (consumption rate divided by weight). The cutoffs for making each category are presented in Table 1. They are based on the scores for all cars approved for sale in Switzerland as of November 30 of each year, and they are revised every 2 years.

Alberini et al. ask whether “A” cars elicit higher prices than similar cars that do not make the “A” grade, and use a “sharp” regression discontinuity design that exploits the similarity of cars that barely qualify for the “A” grade with those that barely fail to make that grade. For robustness, they also use matching methods to compare the prices of A-grade cars with those of cars that are similar for weight, horsepower, fuel used, class, etc. but are not awarded the A grade. They find that auto importers ask from 5 to 11% more for a car that gets the A label than for a similar car that does not quite make that grade.
Concluding remarks
I hope I have made a convincing case that assessing the effects of policies that reduce residential energy use or encourage the purchase of energy-efficient equipment is no easy matter. Data limitations and econometric difficulties make such evaluations problematic, and it takes creative data and econometrics to get around such difficulties. The policies often lend themselves to strategic behavior and gaming; in other cases, it is simply inattention or salience that makes people apparently unresponsive to them. Policy design will thus need to prevent such responses.

It is also possible to specify demand systems and budget share models, which take into account all major categories of household expenditures. We do not consider these more complex and comprehensive models in this paper.

This discussion is limited to the direct rebound effect, namely the effect on the demand for one energy input when energy-efficient technologies that use that input are adopted. We are not aware of studies that have looked at cross rebound effects, such as what happens to the demand for electricity when one installs a more efficient natural gas boiler or insulation. We ignore in this paper indirect rebound effects, namely the fact that saving on energy inputs and hence energy costs frees up income that people can spend by demanding more of other goods. Since these other goods are presumably produced using energy, the indirect rebound effect would result in more energy used and emissions created economy-wide. But Gillingham et al. note that there is virtually no way to calculate this effect reliably, and that it is unlikely to be important.
With a log-log VMT demand function, the key regressor is log price per mile, where price per mile is price of gasoline divided by the car’s fuel economy. But the log of a ratio is the difference in the logs, which means that one can enter log fuel price and log fuel economy separately in the model, with or without imposing that their coefficients be equal in absolute value and opposite in sign.
