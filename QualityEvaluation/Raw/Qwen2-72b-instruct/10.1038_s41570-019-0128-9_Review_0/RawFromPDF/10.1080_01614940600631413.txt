This review is a survey of the main facts and concepts appeared in the last years on
kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane, propane, butane and isobutane.
The accent is put on the mechanisms and the kinetic models used for the description of
this reaction. The main catalysts for ODH of light alkanes and the speciﬁc features of
each type of alkane are discussed. Inﬂuence of the type of supports, promoters, acid–
base properties, type of oxygen on the performance of ODH reaction is also discussed.
No clear interpretation regarding the mode of alkane activation of each stage of this
reaction can be derived from the survey of the literature and the problems which are
still waiting for the solution or need further studies are described.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
The procedures of establishing the mechanism of a chemical reaction are
mainly based on a comparison of experimental kinetic dependencies with
theoretical equations, established on the basis of some model mechanisms
and assumed to be valid under corresponding conditions. The relationship
may be expressed in the form of algebraic, differential, or integral equations
that do not necessarily possess explicit analytical solutions. A theoretical
kinetic model, in so far as it is possible, represents the totality of concepts
regarding the nature, sequences, and rates of the reaction steps leading to

the appropriate expression of the reaction rate. An empirical kinetic model rep-
resents a functional dependence of the reaction rate under conditions in which
the experiments are performed—obviously, the validity of the dependence is
limited only to the experimental conditions considered.
The determination of a molecular mechanism is a difﬁcult task and
requires use of advanced experimental and computational techniques. Even
then, the conclusions reached by different authors are often not unanimous
and various molecular mechanisms are proposed for the same reaction
(e.g., oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on the VPO catalysts). Neverthe-
less, kinetic studies have often been used to provide useful information about the
studied reaction and the catalyst operation. On the basis of these studies one can
identify intermediate products, the nature and quantitative participation of
particular reaction routes (parallel and consecutive reaction paths, branching
of the reactions, etc.) that determine selectivity of the process, as well as the
rate determining step in the sequence of the consecutive reactions. The macro-
kinetic model obtained in this way is usually a starting point for the description
of a molecular mechanism. In all well-known reactions such as ammonia syn-
thesis, gas shift reaction, methanol synthesis, hydrocarbon dehydrogenation,
and many others, kinetic studies were an essential step in the determination
of the reaction mechanism. In the development of kinetic laws for surface reac-
tions, it has been tacitly assumed so far that the surfaces are smooth, i.e., all
parts of the surface are of the same activity; this is the so-called Langmuir
type surface. As is well known, strict conformity of adsorption to the Langmuir
isotherm is rarely observed due to the multitude of surface sites of different
coordination and heat of adsorption, and therefore of different activity. The
rate of reaction, however, varies exponentially with the activation energy and
hence the reaction proceeds mainly on the most active sites of the lowest Ea:
the kinetic laws apply then to the reaction on the group of the most active
sites. This point of view is supported both by experimental works and by
calculations of the absolute reaction rates (1), which indicate that in the case
of oxides and composite catalysts of various kinds, sites active in the reaction
constitute only a thousandth or less of the total number of the surface sites.
The scope of this article is to review fundamental kinetic models used in
analysis of the experimental data and the proposed mechanisms for oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes.

ODH REACTION OF LIGHT ALKANES
The present global demand for light alkenes and their shortage is the conse-
quence of their primary use as monomers/comonomers and a relative
decrease in their production due to changes in operating conditions in catalytic
cracking units. This situation has raised new interest in producing them from

alkanes, which are generally easily available and used as low-cost feedstock
for chemical production.
Dehydrogenation reactions can be used by industry for the production of
light alkanes like ethene, propene, and butene, and so on. All these reactions
are reversible and suffer from several limitations (2).
.
Thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity.
.
Side reactions.
.
Strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high
temperature.
.
Coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation.
There are various approaches of research to overcome these limitations.
One of them is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, which overcomes
most of the obstacles mentioned above. Introduction of an oxidant into the
reaction mixture allows one to oxidize hydrogen that is otherwise evolved as
a product of the dehydrogenation process. The reaction becomes exothermic
and is able to proceed at much lower temperatures. This in turn reduces the
side reactions, such as cracking of alkanes and coke formation, as well as over-
comes the thermodynamic limitations. Molecular oxygen, halogens, sulfur
compounds, and some other reagents can be used as oxidizing agents. The
most attractive reactant for industrial purposes seems to be molecular
oxygen, because of its low cost and little environmental impact (3). However,
ODH has its own drawbacks, such as difﬁculty of controlling the consecutive
oxidation of alkanes/alkenes to carbon oxides. There are also secondary
problems, such as the removal of reaction heat, ﬂammability of the reaction
mixture, and the possibility of reaction runaway (4). The key issue is therefore
the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane
molecule. This is a global problem of key importance for the future in light of
the tendency in the petrochemical industry to directly use alkanes as raw
materials instead of alkenes (5, 6).

TYPES OF CATALYSTS USED IN ODH OF LIGHT ALKANES
The systems studied so far for ODH of light alkanes such as ethane, propane,
n-butane, etc., can be approximately classiﬁed into three groups.
1.
Catalysts based on alkali and alkaline earth ions and oxides.
2.
Catalysts based on reducible transition metal oxides.
3.
Other catalysts such as B/P oxides, Ga/zeolite, LaF3/SmO, and Sn/P.

Their characteristics and catalytic activity have already been analyzed in
the literature (2, 7–10). The nature of alkane inﬂuences not only reactivity,
but also the choice of catalyst. Because of the speciﬁcity of the catalytic
behavior in ODH of ethane (ODHE) when compared to higher alkanes, the
case of ethane will be discussed separately. The best catalytic systems in
ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa.
Other factors inﬂuencing selectivity and activity of the catalytic systems are
the reaction conditions (feed mixture, temperature, and contact time).
Therefore, catalyst selection has to be linked to the type of alkane and the
reaction conditions.
It is well known that, unlike higher alkanes, ethane contains only the
primary C–H bonds (420 kJ), whereas ethene, the ODH product, contains
only the vinylic C–H bonds (445 kJ). The latter are strong and therefore the
activation of ethane requires higher temperatures. Because the energy of the
vinylic C–H bond is higher than that of the primary C–H bond, selectivity to
ethane is expected to increase with temperature. Indeed, as shown in the lit-
erature (9, 11, 12), selectivity to ethene is higher at higher temperatures,
and it is peculiar that catalysts that do not contain easily reducible metal
ions are more selective in ODHE.
3.1.
Catalysts for ODH of Ethane
3.1.1.
Alkali and Alkaline Earth-Based Catalysts
The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g.,
Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction (13), but the optimal
temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K). The
highest selectivities are achieved when chlorine containing compounds are
added to the feed mixture or when a catalyst is doped with halides (14, 15).
The main effect of the chlorine ions is to generate ethyl radical species, and
this effect is critical for achieving a high ethene yield (above 30%). Lunsford
et al. (13, 16, 17) demonstrated the formation of surface generated gas-phase
ethyl radicals at the temperatures between 798–8978K and at a pressure of 1
Torr in the reactor using a matrix-isolation electron spin resonance apparatus
(17). In these experiments the radicals were collected in a solid argon matrix
on a sapphire rod and next were detected by ESR spectroscopy. In the
proposed mechanism of ODHE over lithium promoted magnesium oxide
catalyst, the resulting ethyl radicals may either react with the surface oxygen
to form a surface ethoxide ion (i.e., C2H5O2) or desorb into the gas phase. The
ethoxide ions may either decompose to ethene or be further oxidized to CO
and CO2. The authors claim that another set of reactions is available when
ethyl radicals are desorbed into the gas phase. In this case the formation of
ethene or C4 products is possible, but the formation of the latter was only

observed at high conversions and oxygen-limited conditions (i.e., oxygen conver-
sion is higher than 98%). Some improvement in the selectivity to ethene is also
observed for the system doped with Na, B, lanthanide oxides and SnO2 (18–20).
Several other catalytic systems have been proposed, such as LiCl/NiO (21, 22),
LiTiO, and LiMnTiO (23). For some, an improvement of the selectivity to
ethene has been observed, but they do not show improvement in the ethene
yield in comparison with the base system Li2CO3/MgO(Cl).
An interesting system based on LaF3 associated with a rare oxide (CeO2
and SmO2) and doped with BaF2 has been reported as a catalyst that allows
attaining approximately a 35% yield of ethene from ethane (24, 25).
3.1.2.
Catalysts Based on Reducible Oxides
The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually sig-
niﬁcantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selec-
tivities of the systems described above. It has been shown (26) that oxides of
vanadium, molybdenum, and niobium are active in oxidation at temperatures
as low as 4738K. The conversion of ethane to ethene on various supported metal
oxides such as vanadium, molybdenum, or boron oxides has been reviewed by
Banares (7). The review has also demonstrated the effect of the support, metal
oxide loading, and additive loading on catalytic properties. Supported multi-
component oxide systems such as MoVNb (27), which are one of the most efﬁ-
cient in the production of ethene and acetic acid from ethane, are also
discussed. The same catalyst was studied by Burch and Swarnakar (28) but
the performance obtained was a little poorer. High selectivities to ethene can
be also obtained using Keggin-type heteropolymolybdates containing Sb and
W (29), but this type of catalyst suffers deactivation in long-term experiments.
Kaddouri et al. (30) studied ODHE on a and b-phases of NiMoO4 and found
that the a-phase is more selective and active than the b-phase. The same
reaction was also studied by Fierro et al. (31, 32) for the mixed oxide systems
of the MVSb type where (M ¼ Ni, Co, Bi, Sn) and the best results were found
for the NiVSb catalyst.
It has been also found by evolutionary approach that the CrCoSnW and
CrMo mixed oxides supported on a-Al2O3 (33) are promising new catalysts
for the ODHE.
3.2.
Catalysts for ODH of Propane and Butane
An extensive review of the catalytic systems used in ODH of lower alkanes
is given in Grzybowska (8). The systems for ODH of propane (ODHP) can be
divided into two groups: 1) vanadium-based systems (vanadates and vanadia
dispersed on various oxides) and 2) molybdenum-containing catalysts (molyb-
dates and supported MoO3). It is well known that V2O5 is not a good catalyst
for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, but the same vanadia supported on

alumina or sepiolite gives a more selective catalyst (34, 35). These catalysts are
characterized by relatively low selectivity (,40%) and yield (8–9%) to propene,
but they are active at low temperatures (623–6738K). The catalysts based on
the VMgO system have been investigated in recent years by Kung et al. and
other authors (35–40). These catalysts are characterized by relatively high
selectivities and yields (60% and 20%, respectively) and they produce oxyge-
nates. However, there is no agreement in the literature as to the nature of the
phase that gives the best catalytic performance (35–37, 40), and it is likely that
factors other than the crystalline structure of the vanadates, such as presence
of small amounts of V2O5 or alkali metals, enrichment in either magnesium or
vanadium, particle size, and so on, may have inﬂuence on catalytic activity.
Smits et al. (41–43) investigated the VNbO system, which exhibits good pro-
ductivity to propene and apparently does not yield any oxygenated products.
Selectivity to propene was as high as 90% for low conversions of propane and
the catalyst operated at relatively low temperatures (653–7238K).
Grzybowska et al. (44–53) studied ODHP on the vanadia and molybdena
based catalysts containing alkalis (K, Li, and Rb) and transition metals (Ni, Cr,
V, Mo, and P) as promoters (49–56). For the VMgO catalyst, an addition of
redox elements led to an increase in activity and selectivity, while alkalis sig-
niﬁcantly decreased activity and increased selectivity. The effect of doping the
active phase of the catalysts by alkalis on the catalytic performance in ODHP
and ODHE was studied (43, 48). The effect of doping the support with altervalent
ions (Caþ2, Alþ3, Feþ3, Wþ6) and ofthe sequence of potassium introductioninto the
VOx/TiO2 catalysts on the physicochemical and catalytic properties in ODHP was
also studied (46, 50). The supports used for deposition of the vanadium or molyb-
denum phase range from conventional carriers such as TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO,
and molecular sieves (48) to highly porous structures of pillared interlayered
clays (47). Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a
catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an
isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst.
Various metal molybdates were examined by Moro-oka et al. (59–61).
Stern and Grasselli (62) investigated single and binary molybdates supported
on silica (Co, Ni, Mn, Mg, and/or Zn), ternary molybdates Ni0.45Co0.45
X0.066MoO4 (where X ¼ P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce), and systems of the formula
Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4 (where Y ¼ K, Ca). The best performance was obtained
for the NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2 catalysts. Generally, similarly
to supported vanadia and molybdena catalysts, an addition of the redox
elements led to an increase in activity but a decrease in selectivity. The
addition of P did not affect the catalytic performance, while Bi and alkalis
signiﬁcantly decreased activity. Molybdena supported on various oxides
(Nb2O5, TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, ZrO2) was less selective than systems contain-
ing supported vanadia, with the yield of propene for molybdena supported on
TiO2, Al2O3, and MgO not exceeding 8% (63). Other systems studied for this

reaction were NiMgAl spinels (64) and tungstates (65). A system containing
NiO dispersed on CeO2 has been also found active and selective already at
relatively low temperatures (44, 66, 67).
The ODH of n-butane (ODHB) is interesting as a novel, alternative, and
direct way for styrene production. A characteristic feature of n-butane oxidation
is the isomerization of oleﬁns, which is favored by the presence of acid sites in
additiontothe oxydehydrogenationand total oxidationsites.Mostofthe catalysts
for ODHB are based on vanadium oxide, which can be supported on basic oxides
such as MgO, Al2O3, or sepiolite, or used as a component in mixed oxide systems
(2, 68). The ODH of n-butane on vanadia supported on MgO or MgAlO mixed
oxides has been investigated (69). The results show that the higher acidic charac-
ter of the catalyst, the lower selectivity to C4-oleﬁns from n-butane. The VOx/
Al2O3 system (70) was investigated as a potential catalyst for this reaction, but
the yield of the ODH products at 7238K was rather low (4.5%).
A review (71) by Lopez Nieto et al. shows that VMgO mixed oxides are the
best catalysts for ODH of n-butane. The VMgO system, pure and doped with
Mo alone or combination of Mo, W, Cr, and Fe, has been studied (70, 72).
It was shown that incorporation of additives favored selectivity and yield to
the ODH products (especially butadiene).

MECHANISM OF ODH OF ALKANES
Though the mechanisms of ODH reactions proposed by different authors differ
from each other in some details and depend on the type of catalyst and alkane,
some common features can be found.
On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes
seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1.
Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical
adsorption).
2.
Rupture of the C–H bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3.
Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimin-
ation) and formation of alkene.
4.
Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst.
The surface alkyl species can also form alkoxide (73, 74) species (a compet-
ing pathway), which can be further oxidized to aldehydes and carboxylates and
then to carbon oxides.
However, the detailed way in which alkenes interact with the catalyst
surface depends on the type of catalyst and alkane (9, 68, 75, 76). For
example, detailed mechanisms for the activation of butane and propane on

isolated VO4, which are characteristic of Mg3V2O8, VOx/SiO2, VAPO-5, and
other catalysts, are different (69). It has been shown that for vanadium and
molybdenum oxides, both monomeric (77, 78) and polymeric (65, 79) units
can be considered as active in ODH of lower alkanes and that the V(Mo)-O
terminal bond is not involved in the oxidation reactions. This supposition
was conﬁrmed by both the experimental rate of oxygen exchange in the
oxygen labeled Me-18O and by the cluster model studies, performed by
means of the ab initio DFT method to examine electronic properties of different
surface O atoms in the V-O, V-O-P, and V-O-Mg systems and to correlate them
with the catalytic performance. It was also shown that the terminal bond con-
sidered earlier as active in selective oxidation had low activity (80–82). The
same method was also used to study catalytic properties such as reactivity of
differently coordinated surface oxygen (82), effects of additives of vanadia-
based catalysts for ODHP (83, 84), and energetics of the reoxidation process
(85). Furthermore, it was shown (86) that the interaction of an organic
molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which pro-
ceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels
and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species.
The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the
ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher
than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to
the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57). The
environment of the active center on which the dissociation of alkane
proceeds may vary between several conﬁgurations. As has been shown (69),
for the vanadium-based catalysts different types of vanadium species could
be correlated with different behaviors of the catalysts. Strength and reducibil-
ity of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the for-
mation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support
and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive. As
a result, the rate of formation of the oleﬁnic intermediate and the oleﬁn
desorption seem to depend on the acid-base character of the catalysts.

KINETIC MODELS FOR OXIDATIVE DEHYDROGENATION
OF LIGHT ALKANES
As the basis for the development of rate equations, it is postulated that a gas-
phase chemical reaction, when catalyzed by a solid, actually occurs on the
surface of the catalyst and involves the reaction of molecules or atoms that
are adsorbed by the active centers of the surface. In the heterogeneous gas-
solid system, a catalytic reaction proceeds according to the following stages (87):
1.
Diffusion of the reactants towards the surface of the catalyst.
R. Grabowski

Downloaded by [Laurentian University] at 01:55 17 April 2013 
2.
Adsorption of the reactants on the surface.
3.
Reaction on the surface.
4.
Desorption of the products from the surface.
5.
Diffusion of the reaction products from the catalyst surface.
It is evident that the rates of these ﬁve types of operations are dependent on
different factors, in addition to the concentration or concentration gradients
involved (88). Stages 1 and 5 are determined by, among other things, the
ﬂow characteristics of the system, such as mass velocity of the ﬂuid stream,
diffusional characteristics of the ﬂuid and degree of porosity of the catalyst,
dimensions of the pores, and the extent to which they are interconnected.
Stages 2 and 4 are determined by the character and extent of the catalytic
surface and by speciﬁc activation energies required for the adsorption and des-
orption of the components of the gas phase. Stage 3 is determined by the nature
and extent of the catalytic surface and by the activation energies required for
the reaction on the surface. If the second, third, and fourth stages are slower
than the diffusion processes, a realistic kinetic description can be obtained,
otherwise, the kinetic equations will describe the diffusion process. It means
that kinetic constants will not be representative of the chemical reactivity of
the system.
The main models used for the kinetic description of oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of light alkanes are: 1) Eley–Rideal model, 2) Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model, 3) “rake” model, 4) Mars Van Krevelen model—the redox model, and
the 5) power law model.
5.1.
Eley-Rideal Model
According to the Eley–Riedal (ER) model (89, 90), equilibrated adsorption
of species A on the catalyst’s surface is assumed and next its subsequent

Langmuir-Hinshelwood Model
This model (LH) is based on the ﬁndings of Langmuir (91). During the
1920s and 1930s, the kinetics used in the heterogeneous catalysis was based
largely on the Langmuir lattice model of a surface consisting of non-interacting
adsorption sites. These so-called Langmuir kinetics were developed by
Hinshelwood (92). He reasoned that chemisorbed molecules remained on the
surface for a longer time than molecules in close contact during collision in a
homogenous phase; thus, the probability of attaining the required activation
energy is higher on the surface of catalysts than for molecules that react in
the homogenous phase.
This type of reaction can be schematically depicted by the following

The Langmuir-Hinshelwood mathematical treatment is more difﬁcult and
starts from the assumption that all stages but one, the rate-determining step
(e.g., the surface reaction), are very close to a thermodynamic equilibrium.
The concentrations of the components occurring in these equilibrium stages
are interrelated by the conditions for the chemical equilibrium. Different
rate-determining steps are possible.

which can be done only for rather simple cases.
5.3.
Rake Model
The process of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) may be regarded as a set
of reactions by which a molecule is gradually oxidized to the products of total
oxidation. As a consequence, dehydrogenation products represent intermediate
products in the series of consecutive reactions. The selectivity towards a
certain product of ODH does depend on the ratio of the rate constant of the for-
mation and the subsequent reaction of this product. Boutry and Montarnal (93)
and Thomas et al. (94) advanced an idea that the consecutive reactions occur on
the surface of the catalyst. This model was applied to the oxidation of butene to
maleic anhydride (95).

Mars Van Krevelen Model—The Redox Model
The redox model was developed by Mars and Van Krevelen (MK) (96) for
naphthalene oxidation. According to this model, oxygen for the reaction
comes from the lattice of the catalyst and the reduced catalyst is then reoxi-
dized by gaseous oxygen. These two steps can be represented schematically
as follows:
reduction of the oxidized catalyst
hydrocarbon þ oxidized catalyst 


! products þ reduced catalyst
ð24Þ
oxidation of the reduced catalyst
oxygen þ reduced catalyst 


! oxidized catalyst
ð25Þ
In the stationary state, the oxidation rate of the catalyst is equal to its
reduction rate. The stationary state is determined by the ratio of the rate
constants of both reactions.
A steady-state adsorption model (SSAM), which can be regarded as a
surface variant of the MK model, was developed by Downie et al. (97, 98)
and applied also to describe kinetics of the vapor-phase oxidation of o-xylene
over the vanadium oxide catalyst (99, 100). In this model, a steady state is
assumed between the rate of adsorption of oxygen on the surface and the
rate of removal of oxygen by the reaction with hydrocarbon from the gas
phase. Some additional assumptions can be made in this model, such as 1)
oxygen dissociates or 2) oxygen desorption is not negligible.
The ER, LH, and rake models describe the catalytic reaction, while the
redox model concerns variations in the state of the catalyst. The ER and LH
models are the concurrent models, while they are not concurrent with

respect to the redox models (e.g., ER and SSAM), i.e., it is possible that reaction
proceeds according to the ER-SSAM model.
5.5.
Power Law Model
Due to the complex nature of catalytic reactions as well as lack of knowl-
edge of the surface reactions, which are important for the mechanistic model,
some simpliﬁcations must frequently be made in the description of the
complete formal kinetics. A case in point is the power law (101, 102), which cor-
relates the rate of the reaction with the partial pressures of the reactants. The
power law assumes that the reaction rate may be expressed as
r ¼ k0  Pm
A  Pn
B  ðEa=RTÞ
ð26Þ
where m and n are the reaction orders found experimentally and usually these
exponents are not equal to the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of A and B, respect-
ively. The power law model is usually used as a ﬁrst approximation in kinetic
studies of catalytic reactions.

KINETICS OF ODH OF ETHANE
Many papers have been devoted to the study of the catalytic properties of
various materials used in ODHE, but few have considered the kinetic
aspects of this reaction (103–109). In the literature a parallel-consecutive
reaction network has been most often used for the description of the experimen-
tal data for ODHE.
On the basis of the catalytic data obtained for a large number of catalysts
(103), the dependence of the selectivity to ethene on the conversion of ethane
has been analyzed. Assuming that the reactions of both alkane and alkene
are the ﬁrst order in the hydrocarbon, the maximum yield of alkene of about
35% would be obtained when rate constants kA and kE have equal values

Using this consecutive scheme [Eq. (27)] of the alkene formation, it was
shown that at the reaction temperature of around 8738K, the rate constant of
oxidation of ethene (kE) was comparable to the rate constant of oxidation of
ethane (kA). However, for lower temperatures kE was higher than kA, and
the selectivity lower.
There are only a few papers in which models for ODHE have been proposed
(104, 107, 109, 110) (Table 1) and their quantitative veriﬁcation carried out.
In Oyama et al. (104) (Table 1), the kinetic model and reaction network for
the oxidation of ethane was proposed on the basis of the experimental data. The
model was used to gain information on the contributions of particular reaction

products and did not take into account the competitive adsorption by different
species. The rate parameters obtained allowed the determination of the contri-
bution of further oxidation of acetaldehyde and ethene to overall selectivity.
It has been found that COx is formed mainly from ethene and acetaldehyde
and to less extent from ethane, but ethane is practically the only source of
acetaldehyde.
Studies of ODHE on a VOx/g-Al2O3 catalyst (107) (Table 1) carried out in a
ﬁxed bed reactor showed that the main products were ethene, CO, and CO2. An
analysis of the relationships between the ratios of yields to CO and CO2
(Y(CO)/Y(CO2)) and the conversion of ethane and ethene showed that the
reaction occurs in accordance with the parallel-consecutive network. In this
scheme, ethane reacts in two parallel reactions, giving ethene and directly
CO2. Consecutive oxidation of ethene is the only source of CO, but also some
amounts of CO2 are formed in this reaction. Finally, consecutive oxidation of
CO to CO2 is part of the network. On the basis of results obtained for the oxi-
dation of ethane and ethene in the presence of oxygen and in the oxygen-free
feed mixture, the authors concluded that the total oxidation of these hydrocar-
bons occurred only in the presence of gaseous oxygen by the LH mechanism.
Ethene formation from ethane occurred with the consumption of lattice
oxygen, which could be described by the MK mechanism. The CO oxidation
occurs primarily by a redox mechanism or in addition by the participation of
a gas phase or weakly adsorbed oxygen. Data analysis has been performed
with application of the differential method, and preexponential factors and
activation energies for the reaction network have been calculated.
In (111) the ER model was combined with the steady-state adsorption
model (SSAM) for ODHE on a VOx/SiO2 pure catalyst and catalyst doped by
potassium. A detailed description of this model is given in the chapter describ-
ing the kinetics of ODHP. On the basis of the extensive experimental data, the
inﬂuence of the potassium additive and the adsorption of water on the particu-
lar rate constants have been discussed. It was shown that for this catalyst and
for ODHE, there was little inﬂuence of the adsorption of water and potassium
additive on the rate constants of the particular reaction steps and that both
pure and doped catalysts worked in an almost fully oxidized state. A similar
catalyst was studied by J. Le Bars et al. (110). The authors applied the MK
model for the description of kinetic data. The model described the experimental
data quite well for low partial pressures of ethane and oxygen (10%), but for
higher partial pressures, typical deviations observed between experimental
and calculated values were larger (25%). Introduction into the model sites
which are supposed to be inactive for the ethene formation improved the
description of the kinetic data at higher partial pressures. In both models the
reduction of oxidized sites was a limiting step in ODHE, thus the VOx/SiO2
catalyst can be considered to work predominantly in an oxidized state. It was
also found that catalysts obtained both by grafting in toluene and impregnation

in water had rather close values of activation energies for ethene formation
(Table 2), as well as for ethane conversion, and that these energies decreased
with vanadium loading.
The information on material balance (carbon balance) is scarce. No infor-
mation was given in (107 and 110), while for ODHE on VSiO the material
balance was high—carbon and oxygen balances of 100% + 5% were always
achieved—and were practically independent of ethane conversion. On the
other hand, the carbon balance calculated in (111) on the basis of ethene, CO,
and CO2 was 95% + 5% for conversion of ethane 10%, it was, however,
poorer (90% + 5%) at lower conversions.
The activation energies for different stages of ODHE based on the models
described above are collected in Table 2. As one can see from this table, the acti-
vation energies taken from (104) are much higher than those taken from
(107, 111). According to (104), two reasons can be a source of these differences:
1) the experimental basis was not broad enough, and 2) some radical reactions
participated in ODHE. The remaining differences may come from the fact that
the catalysts and models used for the ODH reaction of ethane were different.
However, it should be stressed that in the case of the models described in
(107) and (111), the activation energies for the same steps are quite close.
In conclusion, one can state that kinetics of ODHE for the above-mentioned
systems generally can be explained by the parallel-consecutive network. Most
of the papers propose models of varying complexity that are based on qualitat-
ive data derived from changes of conversion and selectivities or yields to the
products under the inﬂuence of particular factors such as contact time,
partial pressure, etc. Only in (111) was the feed mixture composition
changed in a relatively broad range of concentrations, so in this case the

experimental basis was the broadest and the proposed model was fairly
reliable. The formation of an ethoxy complex is proposed as the ﬁrst step of
the ODH reaction of ethane for most of the mechanistic models, but successive
stages of ODHE proposed by different authors are different and depend on the

KINETICS OF ODH OF PROPANE
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on different types of catalysts is
the most frequently studied reaction in ODH of alkanes. Unlike dehydrogena-
tion, ODHP is an exothermic [DH8 (4208C) ¼ 2116.7 kJ/mol], irreversible
process [DG8 (4208C) ¼ 2176.1 kJ/mol] (112). However, selectivity of the oxi-
dative process to oleﬁns is limited because of the formation of COx, which is
the most stable product thermodynamically. Many researchers focused on
developing selective catalysts for ODHP, but there are only a limited number
of publications concerning the kinetics and mechanism (62, 64, 65, 113–134).
In the case of ODHP, most papers dedicated to the kinetics of this reaction
have concerned catalysts containing vanadium (65, 111–118, 120–129,
133, 134). Other catalysts such as nickel molybdates (62, 119, 131, 132),
oxides, mixed oxides, and spinels (64, 125, 135) have received less attention.
7.1.
Vanadium-Containing Catalysts
The paper of S.L.T. Andersson (115) is one of the ﬁrst dedicated to the
kinetics of ODHP
on a VOx/AlPO4 catalyst
with varying loading
of
vanadium (0.2–15 wt.%) tested for different temperatures and for variable
partial pressures of oxygen and propane. The formation of propene was
found to be favored by an increase of propane partial pressure. From the depen-
dence of the rate of ODHP on oxygen partial pressure it was concluded that
kinetics of this reaction could be described within the frameworth of the
Rideal model (Table 3). In this model, describing only the rate of disappearance
of propane, a concurrent adsorption of oxygen and propane is proposed, but the
reaction occurs between adsorbed oxygen and propane from the gas phase. On
the basis of this model, the author determined equilibrium constants of the
adsorption of O2 (KO2) and C3H8 (KC3H8) and showed that both KO2 and KC3H8
varied with the vanadium content. The changes of the values of the equilibrium
constants were interpreted as a result of the change in the mechanism of the
ODHP reaction.

proposed two power law models and mechanistic models for the description of
this reaction. (Table 3). The ﬁrst power law model (PM1) proposed by Creaser
and Andersson (113) was based on the assumption of a consecutive reaction in
which all carbon oxides were produced by the oxidation of propene. In the
second model (PM2), CO2 was produced by the oxidation of CO.
Mechanistic models (LH1 and LH2) proposed in (113) were based on the
Langmuir-Hinshelwood scheme of reaction (Table 3). In the LH1 model, the
authors assumed that propane, which lacked p-bonding electrons if adsorbed
on the surface, was immediately dehydrogenated to propene. In this model,
CO, propene, and oxygen adsorbed on the same sites, whereas in the LH2
model oxygen adsorbed on separate sites and propane reacted directly with
oxygen on the catalyst surface. Additionally, it was assumed for both models
that equilibrium was established between the adsorbed and gas-phase
propene. Carbon oxides in both models were produced in a consecutive
reaction and the catalyst was reoxidized by oxygen from the gas phase.
The calculations showed that both LH type models had the same ﬁt error
(7.7%) and that there was no signiﬁcant lack of ﬁt in either model. However,
this description is formal and in the case of the LH1 model, the surface
coverage of oxygen was badly described. In the case of the LH2 model, the esti-
mated value of heat of oxygen adsorption was DHO2 ¼ 3.6 J/mol. This indicated
that the process was endothermic, which contradicted the experiment.
In the same paper two types of MK models (MV1 and MV2) were also con-
sidered. The MV1 model was based on the assumption that the rate of reaction
is proportional both to the pressure of propane and fraction of free sites,
whereas in the MV2 model the reaction rate depended on the degree of oxi-
dation of the catalyst (Table 3). All models were ﬁtted to the experimental
data with similar ﬁtting errors (7.3–7.8%), but the MV1 and MV2 type
models ﬁtted data satisfactorily without any large correlation between the par-
ameters and in the opinion of the authors they were most suitable for the
description of the experimental data. The activation energy for the oxidation
of the catalyst (E3), calculated on the basis of the MV2 model, was higher
than that for either of the reducing reactions (E1 and E2). This means that
the catalyst is more oxidized at higher temperatures, and the low dependence
on oxygen pressure in the PL1 and PL2 models suggests that the catalyst
surface is nearly saturated with oxygen. In all models, only one type of
surface oxygen is taken into consideration.
Transient kinetic analysis of ODHP on the V-Mg-O catalyst (122, 125)
(Table 3) supports the redox mechanism, assuming that propane reduces the
catalyst, which is subsequently oxidized by gas-phase oxygen. The results of
the kinetic studies in (125) also show that only lattice oxygen participated in
propene formation. Adsorbed oxygen leads to the formation of COx, although
lattice oxygen also causes the total oxidation but to a lesser extent. Conse-
quently, selectivity to propene in the absence of gas-phase oxygen is higher

than co-feed steady-state selectivity at the same propane conversion. Using
temporal-analysis-of-products (TAP), Pantazidis et al. (122) came to similar
conclusions and showed that partial and total oxidation of propane occurred
on the same surface sites but involved different forms of reactive oxygen.
The nucleophyllic lattice oxygen takes part in the formation of propene while
adsorbed electrophyllic oxygen species, originating from gas-phase oxygen,
are responsible for direct total oxidation of propane. The consecutive oxidation
of propene can involve both types of oxygen species.
Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of ODHP were investigated for a V-Mg-O
system modiﬁed by antimony (120, 121). The authors carried out an analysis of
the catalytic results (120) and came to the conclusion that propene was the only
useful primary product and COx were produced largely by the sequential
oxidation of the intermediate propene formed in situ and to a lesser extent
on the parallel route by a direct total oxidation of propane. It was also
shown (121) that the partial oxidation of propane and propene were zero
order in oxygen, whereas total oxidation was half order. These facts
allowed the authors to draw the conclusion that different forms of reactive
oxygen were involved in the partial and total oxidation reactions. The MK
model was proposed for the formation of propene and the LH model for
the total oxidation of propane. On the basis of the literature data the
authors proposed a working model of the mechanism reaction. In this
model, vanadium ions form inorganic radicals (V-O.), which are necessary
for the activation of propane. If such centers are structurally isolated from
each other (Sb-O-V-O-Sb) in the antimony matrix, they are active in
propene formation while COx is formed on multiple vicinal vanadium
sites (Sb-O-V-O-V-O-Sb). Such a model leads to the conclusion that improve-
ment of selectivity to propene can be achieved by lowering the vanadium
content and/or through solid-state positioning of vanadium in the catalyst
structure.
A relatively ample number of studies of the kinetics of ODHP were carried
out for pure vanadia catalysts and vanadia catalysts doped by K or Rb
(65, 111, 114, 116, 118, 123, 124, 132–134, 136, 138) supported on different
oxides [TiO2 (anatase), ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2].
Vanadia supported on ZrO2 was used as a catalyst for isotopic studies and
kinetic analysis of the ODHP reaction (65, 117, 136). In a parallel-consecutive
model of ODHP was used for an analysis of kinetic isotope effects. It was found
that the reaction kinetics was consistent with a MK redox sequence (Table 3) in
which lattice oxygen participated in the activation of a C-H bond in C3H8. The
produced alkyl species desorb from the surface of the catalyst as propene and
remaining OH groups reduce the vanadium centers and recombine to form
water. The reduced centers are oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorp-
tion of O2. Isotopic tracer studies fully conﬁrmed the assumption of the model
described above.

Kinetic studies on this catalyst (65) (Table 3) allowed the authors to explain
an increase of selectivity to propene with the increase of vanadium content in
the catalyst. The results of the calculation showed that with increasing
vanadium content in the catalyst, the ratio of the rate constant of propene for-
mation to the rate constant of parallel formation of COx (k1/k2) increased,
while the ratio of the rate constant responsible for the subsequent oxidation
of propene to the rate constant of propene formation (k3/k1) remained almost
not inﬂuenced. At higher VOx content, speciﬁc activity of the catalyst
declined, but propene selectivity remained constant.
The kinetic studies of the ODHP reaction on a V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 catalyst in a
differential reactor were based on the MK model (130). Three different
vanadium oxide catalysts, containing comparable amounts of vanadium,
were investigated. All catalysts were prepared by grafting but followed differ-
ent procedures. The interpretation of the obtained results was carried out
using a pseudo ﬁrst-order approach, similar to (116). The mathematical
regression analysis of the obtained data showed that kred and kox were
strongly correlated and their ratio was 1. The kinetic behavior of the
studied catalyst was similar and the authors claimed that the hydrogen
abstraction from propane seemed to be the rate-determining step and for all
studied catalysts the ODHP reaction occurred with an activation energy of
about 84 kJ/mol.
The effect of the catalyst structure on ODHP on alumina supported
vanadia was studied by application of the model described earlier (65)
(Table 3). The authors found that, for propane, the rate constant for selective
reaction (k1) and its ratio with the rate constants for propane and propene com-
bustion (k2/k1 and k3/k1, respectively) depended in a different way on tempera-
ture and vanadia surface density. Ratio k2/k1 increased with the vanadia
surface density and depended weakly on the reaction temperature, which indi-
cated that activation energies for selective reaction and propane combustion
were similar. Ratio k3/k1 decreased with increasing temperature, and thus,
the apparent activation energy for propane combustion was lower than that
for propane dehydrogenation, and the difference between these two activation
energies decreased with increasing vanadia surface density. This led to the
lowering of propene selectivity, which was attributed to an increase of
propene adsorption enthalpy with increasing vanadia surface density. On the
basis of the changes of rate constant ratios k2/k1 and k3/k1 as a function of
vanadia density on the surface of the catalyst in different temperatures, the
authors claimed that generally, selectivity to propene and ethene increased
with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface
density.
The inﬂuence of molybdena on catalytic properties of vanadia domains
supported on alumina in ODHP was studied in (126) in terms of the parallel-
consecutive reaction scheme described in (65). Kinetic analysis showed that
R. Grabowski

Downloaded by [Laurentian University] at 01:55 17 April 2013 
the ratio of the rate constants for combustion of propane and propene to
dehydrogenation of propane was signiﬁcantly lower for vanadia supported on
a monolayer of molybdena than that for vanadia supported on alumina
alone. The authors explain these results by the presence of V-O-Mo bonds
formed by a reaction of the dispersed vanadia with the molybdena layer on
the surface of the alumina support. This leads to a better dispersion of
vanadia species than on alumina alone and to the observed decrease of the
k3/k1 ratio. This interpretation is consistent with the observation of an
increasing amount of V2O5 with increasing densities of surface VOx on both
MoOx/Al2O3 and Al2O3 supports.
More profound kinetic studies of the ODHP reaction were carried out for
vanadia supported on g-Al2O3 (Table 3). Two approaches were presented in
this paper. In the ﬁrst, power law expressions were used to describe the
parallel-consecutive scheme of the ODHP reaction. On account of a high
number of undetermined parameters, the authors used a “cascade” approach—
the reaction scheme was divided into three sub-schemes and the kinetic con-
stants and reaction orders were determined for each sub-scheme separately.
In the second approach, the experimental data were ﬁtted with the rate
equations obtained by assuming the redox mechanism of the ODHP reaction.
In this mechanism only selective reaction (formation of propene) was con-
sidered. The reaction rate was obtained by considering a very quick desorption
of propene and water and the assumption of the steady-state condition for
propane adsorption and water desorption. Surface reaction and site reduction
were taken as the rate-determining steps. The obtained equations were linear-
ized for both the constant pressure of oxygen and propane in the reaction
mixture. This methodology allowed the authors to determine initial estimates
of the rate constants. These estimates were used subsequently in a more
accurate nonlinear regression analysis. The ﬁnal results showed that the
above-described mechanism interprets well the experimental data.
The ODHP on 10% V2O5/Al2O3 and 4% V2O5/TiO2 catalysts and the effect
of the oxide support on this reaction were studied by estimating the reaction
parameters (137) (Table 3). For this purpose an MK model containing eight par-
ameters was used. The MK mechanism considered propene as the only primary
product and carbon oxides as the secondary products. The parameters esti-
mated were the preexponential factors and activation energies. Calculation
results showed that for both types of supports a similar catalytic cycle
occurred but the rate at which the catalytic cycle occurred was higher on a
more reducible titania support compared to the rate on the less reducible
alumina support; thus, the support had a signiﬁcant effect on reaction rate
constants.
The kinetics of ODHP on a VOx/TiO2 (anatase) pure catalyst and catalyst
doped by potassium or rubidium was studied under transient (113, 123, 124)
and stationary (114, 116, 129, 132, 134, 138) conditions.

In (116) (Table 4), a simple consecutive kinetic model was proposed for the
ODHP reaction to study the evolution of selectivity to propene as a function of
k1/k2. The authors obtained a good correlation between the experimental and
theoretical curves for ratio k1/k2 ¼ 0.12 of the rate constants for propene (k1)
and COx formation (k2) for ﬁve types of catalysts: V2O5, VMgO, VTiO, VSiO,
and for NiMoO4. They also proposed a classiﬁcation of performance in selectiv-
ity to propene based on the value of k1/k2.
In (118), a comparison of the results of the kinetic modeling of ODHP
obtained in stationary aerobic and nonstationary anaerobic conditions was
carried out. Two types of ER-Steady State Adsorption Model (ER-SSAM)
models (ER-SSAM-1 and ER-SSAM-2) (Table 4) were used for the description
of the experimental results obtained under stationary conditions. The ER-
SSAM model is based on an assumption, suggested by the results of transient
experiments, that propane is not adsorbed at the catalyst surface and reacts
directly from the gas-phase (an ER-type reaction). The reaction products
desorb immediately from the catalyst surface to the gas phase, leaving
oxygen vacancies, which are replenished by the dissociative adsorption of
oxygen from the gas phase. At the catalyst surface, a stationary oxygen
coverage is established, as is postulated in (139). The orders of the propane for-
mation and the COx formation with respect to oxygen coverage were both taken
as 1 for the ER-SSAM-1 model, and 1 and 2 for the ER-SSAM-2 model,
respectively.
One hypothesis states that one type of surface oxygen is responsible for the
formation of propene and the total combustion is based on the assumption that
an alkane molecule can interact with the surface oxygen by adopting a parallel
conﬁguration of a carbon chain. This conﬁguration makes possible a concurrent
interaction of several oxygen atoms with two neighboring carbon atoms in an
alkane molecule. On the other hand, the selective pathway of ODHP should
be favored by an interaction of a propane molecule oriented perpendicularly
to the surface with a single oxygen atom. These differences in the orientation
of alkane molecules imply different orders (1 and 2, respectively) with
respect to the oxygen surface coverage for the alkene formation and for the
combustion reactions. This hypothesis which is conﬁrmed also by the results
of the calculation for transient experiments under anaerobic conditions, can
be considered as competitive to the hypothesis of one type of surface oxygen
responsible for total oxidation and the other type for formation of alkene.
Kinetic studies of ODHP on vanadia supported on TiO2 were carried out by
a transient method under nonstationary conditions in (123, 124). The exper-
imental partial pressure curves of the products obtained in the transient
kinetic experiments have been satisfactorily simulated using a mechanism
based on the proposition of Oyama (140). According to this proposition, the
initial adsorption of a hydrocarbon molecule is dissociative, with a hydrocarbon
moiety adsorbed on an O22 ion or on an exposed vanadium ion (vacancy). The

adsorption on O22 is relatively weak and may give selective products (propene),
while the adsorption on vanadium is strong and leads to the formation of total
oxidation products. The results of the calculation have led to the conclusion
that propane reacts directly from the gas phase with the catalyst oxygen and
that product desorption from the surface of the catalyst is rapid, i.e., this
step of the reaction occurs according to the ER mechanism. On the basis of
these assumptions, a mechanistic model of ODHP in transient experiments
(123, 124) was proposed (Table 4) and the rate constants (preexponential
factors and activation energies) for all stages of the model were calculated.
The kinetics of ODHP on pure VTiO and VTiO doped with K or Rb was
studied under stationary conditions in (114, 129, 134, 138). The papers used
an ample set of data on propane conversion and selectivities to oxidation
products as a function of reagent mixture composition, temperature and
contact time to verify power-type and mechanistic models. In (114) (Table 4),
a parallel–consecutive model was proposed for the description of the exper-
imental data of ODHP over a vanadia-titania (VTiO) pure catalyst and
catalyst doped with Rb (RbVTiO). In this model, it was assumed that the
rate of reaction was proportional to concentration of propane and was indepen-
dent of concentration of oxygen (the ﬁrst zero-order model—FZO). In this
network, carbon oxides are formed by consecutive oxidation of propene,
formed in a ﬁrst step and by parallel total combustion of propane. As shown,
the model describes correctly a qualitative dependence of propane conversion
and selectivities to propene, CO, and CO2 on temperature and contact time,
but the quantitative description is not satisfactory.
In (129), simple pseudo-homogenous models [FZO and power-type model
(PM)] were compared for ODHP on the VTiO catalyst with an “analytical”
version of the ER-SSAM model, which assumed that surface oxygen was in a
steady state and that the reoxidation of the VTiO catalyst was much more
rapid than its reduction by propane (141). In this type of ER-SSAM model,
only one type of oxygen was assumed, which allowed the analytical solution
of relevant equations. The ﬁtting error of the models studied decreased in
the order FZO , PM , ER-SSAM. The following assumptions of the ER-
SSAM model were thus conﬁrmed by good agreement between the experimen-
tal data and results of calculation:
.
The reaction of propane/propene on the catalyst proceeds through the ER
mechanism.
.
The steady state of oxygen is established on the surface.
.
The oxygen adsorption has a dissociative character.
Similarly to Creaser and Andersson (113), the PM and ER-SSAM models
(114, 118, 129, 134, 138) imply that the vanadia-titania catalyst is nearly

saturated with oxygen or completely oxidized under reaction conditions, which
is conﬁrmed by a close to zero degree of reduction of the catalyst after the
reaction and by the values of the calculated oxygen coverages.
In (134, 138) (Table 4), vanadia-titania catalysts, pure and potassium/
rubidium promoted, have been examined to verify how the alkali metal pro-
motion affected rates of formation of different selective and nonselective
products. In (134) two kinetic models of ODHP were proposed: an LH model
(LH-1 and 2 models) and ER (ER-SSAM-1 and 2 models described above). In
the case of the LH models it was assumed: 1) the rates of consumption of
propane and formation of propene and COx depended on the rates of surface
reactions of the appropriate adsorbed species, and 2) the equilibrium
between adsorption and desorption of propane, propene, and oxygen was estab-
lished immediately and was described by the Langmuir equation. Additionally,
it was assumed that total oxidation reactions were strongly shifted to the for-
mation of carbon oxides and that the carbon oxides desorbed immediately
from the surface and did not block it. In the LH-1 model, the rates of COx for-
mation from propane and propene depend linearly on oxygen coverage, and in
the LH-2 model this coverage is squared. All these reactions are assumed to be
ﬁrst-order with respect to hydrocarbon coverages. As was shown, the ER-
SSAM model described ODHP more adequately than the LH-type models
both for nondoped and rubidium-doped catalysts. Results of the calculations
carried out within the framework of the ER-SSAM-2 model, which described
the experimental data with the least error, have shown that an addition of
rubidium led to a decrease of rate constants of propene formation, simul-
taneously decreasing signiﬁcantly the rate constants of COx formation,
mainly by lowering their preexponential factors. Within the framework of
this model, propane from the gas phase interacts with oxygen of the catalyst
and subsequently undergoes a selective reaction or is oxidized to COx. The
addition of rubidium leads to a decrease of the subsequent combustion of
propene, which is the main source of COx and in consequence, leads to an
increase of selectivity to propene. The observed decrease of preexponential
factors of the rate constants for all stages of the ODHP reaction indicates a
blocking of the active centers and leads to a decrease of catalytic activity of
the rubidium-doped catalyst in comparison with the nondoped one. A similar
model (ER-SSAM–2) (Table 4) was applied to ODHP on VTiO and VTiO
doped by potassium (138). In this study, a more basic support was used for
the synthesis of the catalyst, and the inﬂuence of potassium is weaker than
the inﬂuence of Rb, but all changes in the rate constants describing ODHP
are qualitatively similar. Additionally, oxygen coverages calculated on the
basis of the ER-SSAM-2 model, for catalysts doped with potassium and
rubidium (134, 138) are higher than those for the pure vanadia-titania catalyst.
The apparent activation energies for the formation of different products in
ODHP on vanadia containing catalysts are shown in Table 5. As one can see,

they depend both on the type of the support on which vanadia is deposited and
on the model that is applied for the description of the experimental data. Gen-
erally, one can observe that the activation energy of the catalyst reoxidation is
the highest and that the alkali additives (K, Rb) lead to a visible decrease of the
preexponential factors in the constant rates for all proposed reaction stages,
while the activation energy is less inﬂuenced.

Ni–Co-Mo Catalysts
Several papers were devoted to the kinetics of ODHP over NiMoO4
(62, 119, 132) or Ni-Co-molybdates (62, 132). The catalysts were studied
under transient (119) and steady-state conditions (62, 119, 131, 132). In
(Table 6), ODHP on NiMoO4 under transient and steady-state conditions was
studied. Under steady-state conditions the inﬂuence of partial pressures of
propane and oxygen was studied between 803–833 K. The dependence of
yields of the products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) as a function of propane conversion
showed that propene was the only primary product, and carbon oxides were
formed in the consecutive reaction as secondary products. The model
proposed by the authors consisted of four stages. In the ﬁrst step, adsorbed
propyl species are formed on the surface of the catalyst. These species can
only evolve into gaseous propene, which subsequently reacts with the surface
oxygen, giving COx. The system of differential equations, describing the
above mechanism, was used for the calculation of the rate constants, and the
partial pressure curves were simulated using the rate constants obtained in
such a way. The agreement between the calculated and the experimental
results was generally good. This model with an additional step of the
catalyst oxidation was applied to the description of ODHP under stationary
conditions. The rate constants determined in transient experiments were
used with the aim of determining the rate constant for the reoxidation of the
catalyst. The obtained results have been described by an MK model (Table 6)
for a dissociative and nondissociative adsorption of oxygen, and the appropri-
ate rate constants of an MK mechanism have been calculated. It was shown
that the experimental data were described better by the model with dissoci-
ative adsorption of oxygen. The rate constants obtained led to a good description
of
the reaction
rate
of
ODHP,
but the selectivities to propene
were
overestimated.
The reaction network and kinetics of ODHP over Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2
were described by Stern and Grasseli (62). It was found that the reaction
pathway of ODH of propane gave propene, which oxidized further in a consecu-
tive reaction primarily to acrolein and next to COx. The selective oxidation of
propane to propene and propene to acrolein was found both zero order in
oxygen and ﬁrst order in propane and propene. The total oxidation of
propane to COx was half order in oxygen and ﬁrst order in propane. Total

oxidation of propene has Langmuir-type dependence on propene concentration
and is also half order in oxygen concentration. This means that propene is
formed by nucleophyllic lattice oxygen and that replenishment of the lattice
oxygen is fast, compared to the hydrogen abstraction (MK mechanism) and
that total oxidation of propane and propene occurs by chemisorbed (electro-
phyllic) oxygen on the catalyst surface. The LH type of expression indicates
that the rate-determining step of the reaction involves species that are in
adsorption equilibrium with the gas phase. The calculated rate constants
show that the rate of COx formation from acrolein was 3.5 times that of
acrolein formation from propene and the rate of COx formation from acrolein
was 46 times that of propene formation from propane. Kinetic isotope effects
for activation of both propane and propene were also studied for this reaction
and revealed that methylene hydrogen abstraction and allylic hydrogen
abstraction, respectively, were the rate-determining steps. The authors came
to the conclusion that propene formed via methylene hydrogen abstraction
competed for the same sites as propane, and that lattice oxygen was inserted
from the catalyst surface to form acrolein.
The kinetics of ODHP on b-NiMoO4 has been studied by Sautel et al. (132).
The authors proposed power law type equations to describe the rate of propene
formation. Experimental results indicated that the partial order of propane
was 0.95 and oxygen was 0.025. On the basis of these results, the authors
came to the conclusion that gaseous oxygen was not directly responsible for
ODHP, and the MK model could be applied for the ODHP reaction.. Kinetic
measurements were carried out under conditions of a differential reactor,
which limited the possibility of secondary reactions and maintained high selec-
tivity to propene (selectivity to propene remains greater than 92% in all tests
performed). Under the operating conditions selected for the studies, it was pos-
tulated that the limiting reaction step controlling the overall reaction rate was
the adsorption of propane and oxygen over NiMoO4. The model proposed for
propene formation consisted of six steps (Table 6) involving a reaction
between the gaseous phase and solid surface. In this model, secondary reac-
tions leading to carbon oxides were neglected. Assuming that one step among
the different stages of the reaction of ODHP was the rate-determining step
and that the other stages were at equilibrium, the speciﬁc rate was derived
and the absolute rate of formation of propene was compared with that
measured at the end of the reactor. The authors found that only two steps
could possibly be the rate-determining steps: 1) the adsorption of propane on
the catalyst, and 2) the reaction of the adsorbed propene with oxygen. For
both cases the evolution of the formation rate is proportional to the pressure
of propane introduced and does not depend on oxygen pressure. Only in case
(1) the apparent activation energy could be determined (77 kJ/mol). In the
second case, Ea app contains the enthalpic terms corresponding to the ﬁrst
and fourth reactions (Table 6).

investigated by Barsan et al. (131). They studied, using an integral reactor, the
inﬂuence of partial pressures of propane and oxygen, contact time, and temp-
erature on the reactant conversions and product selectivities. On the basis of
the obtained results, a consecutive reaction network for the ODHP reaction
on this catalyst (Table 6) was proposed, and the authors applied several
possible kinetics models (power-law, MK, LH, and ER). The estimation of
kinetic parameters was carried out by solving a system of ordinary differential
equations and by minimizing the objective function, which was deﬁned as the
sum of squares of difference between the experimental and calculated values
for intensive extent of reaction. The obtained results showed that for the
ODHP reaction the experimental results were in good agreement with two
surface oxidation-reduction models (Table 6). The ﬁrst model was a classical
MK model, in which the rate of the surface reoxidation step was equal to the
rate of the surface reduction step. In this model, the reaction of propane with
the catalyst surface involved one surface oxygen and the resulting intermedi-
ate was converted into propene. In the second model, two oxygen atoms were
necessary for the surface reduction step. The surface reoxidation steps were
the same for both models. Additionally, it was demonstrated that propane
and propene adsorbed on the same adsorption sites.

Other Catalysts
A simple FZO parallel-consecutive kinetic model was applied to the ODHP
reaction on NixMg1-xAl2O4 (64) (Table 7). A general observation was that the
rate of the consecutive oxidation of propene was considerably higher than
that of the propene formation from propane. This observation was explained
by a lower energy of the allylic C-H bond in a propene molecule as compared
with that of the paraﬁnic bonds in propane. It was also found that the acti-
vation energy for propene formation and total propane oxidation decreased
with an increase in Ni content, while the activation energy for consecutive
propene combustion increased at the same time.
These observations were explained by a change in electron density around
oxygen atoms surrounding the nickel cations, which facilitated the hydrogen
abstraction from a molecule of propane. On the other hand, a propene
molecule is more strongly bound to the surface in the case of Ni (unﬁlled
d-orbitals) when Mg ions are being replaced by Ni ions due to a stronger inter-
action of an oleﬁnic molecule due to a donation of p electrons.
Oxidative conversion of propane and its cracking over a lithium-promoted
DyMgO catalyst have been investigated (127) (Table 7). The experiments were
carried out at relatively high temperatures and showed yields of up to 50% of
oleﬁns (propene and ethene). The reaction kinetics was studied by varying
partial pressures of the reactants as well as by adding products to the

reaction mixture. The observations were qualitatively explained within the fra-
mework of two models in terms of mixed homogenous-heterogenous radical
mechanism reaction routes: 1) in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, and 2) in
the presence of gas phase oxygen. The authors claimed that the propane acti-
vation via C–H bond splitting was the rate-determining step for all reaction
products. The presence of oxygen in the reaction mixture appeared to be
crucial for propane conversion. According to the authors, a strong increase of
the reaction rate, as the result of an increase in oxygen concentration, could
be attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain carbon
radicals. This interaction opens a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals. The
second important role of oxygen is to regenerate the catalyst, restoring its
activity for the generation of radicals. In the case of this catalyst, it was also
found that CO2 suppressed its activity for all products. This observation was
attributed to the formation of Li2CO3, which blocked the active sites. In
contrast to the other catalysts, the rate of consecutive reaction of propene to
COx is low when compared to the rate of conversion of propane, due to a
relative stability of the intermediate alkyl radical in comparison with the
propyl radical under the same reaction conditions.
It has been shown that the ODHP reaction can be carried out on a Mn3O4
oxide catalyst with high selectivities and signiﬁcant productivities (135).
Kinetics experiments have been performed in the temperature range 350–
750 K in a differential type reactor. On the basis of earlier studies, the authors
proposed that 2-propoxide was an intermediate of the combustion of both
propane and propene. For an MgCr2O4 catalyst (73), it was found that these
intermediates were responsible for the formation of propene in a direct way
from propane. On the other hand, propene oxidation to CO2 on a cobalt oxide
catalyst occurred through allyl-alkoxides (142). The authors proposed a
reaction scheme (Table 7) and an appropriate system of differential equations
describing this scheme. It was assumed that every reaction in this scheme,
with an exception of the reaction of propene combustion, occurred through the
MK mechanism and that hydrocarbon activation was the rate-determining
step. Propene combustion occurring through 2-propoxide was assumed not to
be a redox step starting from propene. The ﬁtting of the obtained equations to
the experimental rates showed that such an approach appeared to be satisfac-
tory. The results have shown that the combustion of propane on this catalyst
occurred predominantly in a direct way, probably through a different surface
intermediate (allyl-alkoxides). The activation energies for the reduction of the
catalyst by propane and its oxidation are comparable (82 kJ/mol) and
suggest that the rates of the catalyst reduction and reoxidation are comparable
and that the reduction of the catalyst involves the ﬁrst hydrogen abstraction as
the rate-determining step. A lower value for the reduction of the catalyst
through propene (70 kJ/mol) seems reasonable due to a weakness of the allyl-
CH bond of propene with respect to the methylene CH bond of propane cleavage.

KINETICS OF ODH OF N-BUTANE AND ISOBUTANE
8.1.
Kinetics of ODH of n-Butane
Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane (ODHB) was studied by various
authors (68, 143–156) but few kinetic studies have been carried out. Most of
the catalysts described in the literature are based on vanadium oxide as the
main component. In particular, a VMgO mixed oxide catalyst, which exhibits
high activity and selectivity in ODHB, has attracted much attention, and
several articles discuss the kinetics of ODHB (37, 143–148, 152) on this
catalyst.
Chaar et al. (37) applied a power-law equation with a parallel-consecutive
scheme of this reaction to describe ODHB and ODHP on the V-Mg-O catalyst.
On the basis of kinetic results, the authors came to the conclusion that ODH of
both propane and n-butane occured via a similar mechanism. It was also found
that the reaction rate was 0.85 order in butane and zero order in oxygen. A
similar scheme of the reaction was applied by Blasco et al. (143) to a supported
vanadium catalyst. From the variations of the reactivities to C4-oleﬁns with the
conversion of n-butane, two different networks of ODHB were proposed,
depending on the acid-base character of the catalyst. On the catalysts with a
basic
character (VOx/MgO, VOx/hydrotalcite) mono-oleﬁns are directly
formed from n-butane, while butadiene is mainly formed by a consecutive
reaction from butane. On the catalysts with an acidic character, butenes and
butadiene are formed directly from n-butane, while CO and CO2 are formed
mainly by a consecutive reaction. The abstraction of the ﬁrst hydrogen is
the rate-determining step of ODHB, but the second hydrogen abstraction
and/or desorption of oleﬁnic intermediate is considered to be the selectivity-
determining step. The desorption rate of the oleﬁnic intermediates/oleﬁns
from the catalyst with acid character is lower than that from the catalysts of
basic character. The same inﬂuence of the additives on the intermediates/
oleﬁns was observed for ODHP on vanadia supported catalysts, both pure
and doped by alkali metals (111, 115, 118, 134).
Tellez et al. (144) showed that the same reaction network could be applied
to the kinetics of ODHB on VOx/MgO. The authors concluded that selectivity to
COx increased with space time, a behavior characteristic of secondary
products. The selectivity to each butene decreases as the conversion of
butane increases, which is characteristic of intermediate products. Finally, it
was found that selectivity to butadiene increased with contact time (t) and
was different from zero for t ! 0. These observations point to the fact that
butadiene was both the primary and secondary product of ODHB. The exper-
iments under anaerobic conditions showed that selectivity to oleﬁn increased
with the reduction degree, and that the catalyst was able to oxidize butane
in the absence of gas-phase oxygen. The obtained data were described both

by a power-law model and several different mechanistic models (Table 8). The
power-law model showed that the reaction order with respect to oxygen for the
formation of butenes and butadiene from butane was smaller than that for the
formation of COx. This observation suggested that low partial pressure of
oxygen would favor a higher selectivity to oleﬁns. The apparent activation
energies calculated within the framework of this model showed that total
selectivity to oleﬁns was expected to increase with temperature.
Mechanistic models considered for the study of ODHB were based on MK,
LH, and ER mechanisms. Only the experiments with butane in feed were used
for the calculations, and the effect of other hydrocarbons on the reaction rate
was neglected. The ﬁts obtained with the LH and ER models were acceptable
but many kinetic parameters had out-of-range values. This allowed the
authors to reject the LH and ER models. On the other hand, the catalyst had
a signiﬁcant redox capability, oxidizing butane under anaerobic conditions.
These observations led the authors to the conclusion that models based on
the MK mechanism should be studied further. They proposed four different
variants of the MK model (Table 8). The best ﬁt was obtained for the M4
model, which was based on the idea of Pantazidis (152) that two types of
active sites uo and lo were present on the surface of the catalyst. The uo sites
are responsible for both selective and nonselective reactions, while on the lo
sites only nonselective reactions can occur. The M2 model was the second
model describing the experimental data equally well. It also assumed the
presence of two types of active sites on the surface of the catalyst. On the
ﬁrst type, only selective reactions can occur, while on the second types, nonse-
lective ones occur. In both models (M2 and M4), the reaction order with respect
to oxygen were taken as equal to 1. The calculations carried out for these two
models showed that some of the kinetic parameters concerning the reactions
over the lo sites had out-of-range values and in consequence, the M2 model
was chosen.
The same catalyst was studied in ODHB by Rubio et al. under anaerobic
conditions (151) (Table 8). The kinetic model developed by the authors was
based also on an MK mechanism with a single type of active site and two differ-
ent types of oxygen, i.e., lattice oxygen and weakly adsorbed oxygen. The lattice
oxygen, according to the authors, was responsible for the production of oleﬁns
and carbon oxides, whereas the adsorbed oxygen reacted in a nonselective way,
giving COx. Evidence of the existence of weakly adsorbed oxygen on the surface
of this catalyst was provided by the observation that the nonselective contri-
bution decreased after purging the catalyst with an inert gas before the
reaction. It was also found that selectivity to oleﬁns formed with the partici-
pation of the lattice oxygen decreased with an increase in the reduction
degree of the catalyst. This observation seemed to contradict results obtained
under aerobic conditions, where it had been shown that the more oxidizing
the conditions, the less selective the catalyst. This apparent contradiction

can be explained by the existence of two types of oxygen. Under aerobic con-
ditions, the catalyst is almost fully oxidized and an increase of oxygen concen-
tration in the gas phase leads to an increase of the amount of weakly adsorbed
oxygen and does not change the oxidation degree of the catalyst, which results
in an increase in COx production.
In (145), kinetics of ODHB over vanadia supported on a Mg/Al hydrotal-
cite, previously calcined, was studied. For the description of the experimental
data, LH models were used as suitable to reproduce the global kinetic behavior
(Table 8). The authors proposed two types of LH models: 1) a model with a com-
petitive adsorption of n-butane and oxygen (CAM), and 2) a model with a non-
competitive adsorption of the two compounds (NCAM). The kinetic model used
for the description of the experimental data was based on the LH mechanism,
with the assumption that the reaction between two adsorbed reactants was a
controlling step with the noncompetitive adsorption of oxygen. Two types of
oxygen adsorption were considered: 1) dissociative (selective products) or 2)
nondissociative (total oxidation products). Kinetic modeling was carried out
using either a linearized version of the equations or a nonlinear optimization
procedure. On the basis of different types of kinetic modeling (kinetic
modeling from integral conversions and selectivities to oxydehydrogenated
products), the authors came to the conclusion that two different mechanisms
operated on this catalyst. One mechanism is connected to redox functions of
the vanadium species and the other accounts for the vanadium-free sites of
the support. On the redox sites the mechanism can be initiated by a cleavage
of the C-H bond and the formation of a butyl radical, which subsequently inter-
acts with the vanadium species and forms adsorbed oleﬁnic intermediates. The
described mechanism is responsible for COx formation from both n-butane by a
parallel reaction at low butane conversions and from butenes by a consecutive
reaction at high butane conversions. The proposed model allowed the authors
to describe two main paths of the reaction (Scheme II, Table 8) and to establish
a ﬁrst estimation of the kinetic parameters from the reaction network of
Scheme I (Table 8). This, in turn, made possible the adjustment of selectivities
to the main reaction products observed for low and high conversions of butane.
Lemonidu in (147) presented kinetic data for ODHB, as well as for selective
oxidation of 1-butene, 2-butene, and butadiene on a VMgO catalyst containing
30 wt. % V2O5. The experiments, which were used for kinetic analysis, were
carried out in a ﬂow reactor and comprised a dependence of butane conversion
on temperature and contact time. Furthermore, variations of selectivities to
butenes and butadiene were established as a function of butane conversion.
The author also studied a catalytic performance of butenes and butadiene as
a function of reaction temperature, and the effect of the intermediates (CO,
butenes, and butadiene addition) on n-butane conversion and product distri-
bution in order to get information about the relative rates of primary and sec-
ondary reactions. An analysis of the experimental data obtained when the

intermediate products were added led to a kinetic reaction network comprising
10 consecutive and parallel steps (Table 8). For each step the reaction rate was
calculated by the intermediate product addition method. An analysis of the
reaction scheme carried out on this basis showed that butadiene and carbon
oxides were formed in parallel with butenes from n-butane, while additional
amounts of these compounds were produced via consecutive dehydrogenation
and total oxidation of butenes. According to the experimental observations,
an increase in partial pressures of butadiene butenes and COx did not inﬂuence
the rate of butane consumption, which indicated that butane adsorption sites
were different from those of the products.
Cesium-doped nickel molybdate belongs to a second type of catalyst used
for the ODHB reaction that does not contain vanadium. The kinetics and mech-
anism of the reaction on these catalysts was studied in (149–151). In (149) the
kinetic experiments were carried out at 773–833 K, changing the contact time
and partial pressures of both n-butane and oxygen. Only the dehydrogenation
products, CO and CO2, were observed under the experimental conditions. At
lower temperatures (773 K), CO and butadiene selectivities are null at a
short contact time, while selectivity to CO2 is always different from zero.
Such dependence of selectivities indicates that CO and butadiene are second-
ary products, while CO2 can result directly from n-butane. Additionally, the
observed inﬂuence of the contact time conﬁrms that 1-butene and 2-butenes
are formed as the primary reaction products. To describe the observed inﬂuence
of the partial pressure of oxygen and n-butane on the rate of formation of par-
ticular products, a redox mechanism with two different intermediates was
proposed. In this mechanism, COx is formed from all hydrocarbon species
present, while butadiene is formed only from 1-butene. In (150) the authors
proposed a power-law rate equation for two catalysts: unpromoted a-NiMoO4
and Cs-promoted NiMoO4. Fitting this equation to the experimental formation
rates of all products allowed the authors to determine the kinetic parameters.
They showed that the main effects resulting from the Cs addition were: 1) an
increase in activation energies, 2) an increase of the reaction order with
respect to butane for C4 products and a decrease of this order for COx, and 3)
the almost constant reaction order with respect to oxygen. Higher activation
energies for all products and for n-butane are explained by a higher resistance
to reduction of the Cs-doped nickel molybdate. This fact offers further evidence
that the ODHB reaction on this catalyst occurs through an MK mechanism.

Kinetics of ODH of Isobutane
Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane is an important reaction because
isobutene is the most versatile chemical intermediate among all C4 oleﬁns. It
is currently used in industry as a monomer for polyisobutene, a feedstock for
the production of methacrylate, polybutene, etc. Although the use of isobutene

to produce methyl-tert-butyl ether for reformulated gasoline is now question-
able, future use of heavier ethers on the basis of isobutene is possible. In
spite of a large number of studies of light alkanes over different types of cata-
lysts, those on ODH of isobutane to isobutene are rather scarce.
Several types of catalysts have been reported in the literature as selective
to isobutene in ODH of isobutane. The most intensively studied catalysts
include supported magnesium, cobalt, and nickel molybdates (157–160), het-
eropolycids (161–163), and ceramic foam coated with noble metals (Pt, Rh,
Ir, Pd and Pt-Sn). Rare-earth metal oxides (165, 166) and reducible transition
metal oxides (160, 165, 167), phosphates of metals (Mg, Cr, Co, Mn, and Sn) and
of rare earths (168, 169), chromium oxide pure or modiﬁed supported on
various oxides (170–182) were also investigated as catalysts for ODH of iso-
butane. Cobalt or vanadium containing mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-
41) were also tried as catalysts in this reaction (183–185). Vanadium oxide
based catalysts (185–188), which are good catalysts for ODHP, have been
less investigated in this reaction.
Studies of ODH of isobutane have been carried out to screen various cata-
lytic systems (159)– (160, 168)– (169, 182)– (183, 187, 188) and to ﬁnd the
inﬂuence of different factors on selectivity and activity in this reaction. The
factors studied included:
.
Method of preparation (129, 154).
.
Effect and nature of additives, acidity of the catalysts (171, 176, 179).
.
Support and loading of the active phase (165–167, 171)– (172, 186).
.
Identiﬁcation of the active centers and mechanism of the reaction
(160, 170–172, 177–179, 181–184).
.
Feed mixture composition, contact time, etc. (171, 182).
Up to now, however, there have been no systematic studies dealing with
kinetics of ODH of isobutane on any of the catalysts described above. In
(163, 189) the kinetics of selective oxidation of isobutane heteropoly acids
were studied. In this type of reaction, oxygenated products such as methacro-
lein and methacrylic acid are desirable ﬁnal products, while isobutene is an
intermediate product. In (189) where a kinetic investigation of isobutane
over a heteropoly catalyst was studied, the authors assumed that COx, metha-
crolein, and methacrylic acid were the only products of the reaction.
In (163), the authors proposed a reaction network in which methacrylic
acid was produced by a series of consecutive reactions via isobutene and metha-
crolein. In this reaction, network carbon oxides were formed by overoxidation
of methacrylic acid and total oxidation of isobutane. In order to simulate and
estimate the rate of each step, a set of simpliﬁed differential equations was

used. The authors, however, did not take into account in these equations the
inﬂuence of oxygen and water, which were present in the feed mixture, on
the rate of each stage. The kinetics of ODH of isobutane was described by a
set of ﬁrst order equations. It was found that the proposed equations were
not valid if the partial pressures of the compounds were not small compared
to the partial pressures of oxygen, which could be explained in the framework
of an MK or ER model by the increasing role of catalyst reoxidation.
The emphasis was on the determination of activation energies and rate
constants of all reaction steps involved. On the basis of the kinetic results,
the mechanism for a particular step of this reaction was proposed. The acti-
vation energies and frequency factors were determined by an optimization
over a complete range of isobutane conversions. The authors found that the
activation energy of isobutane oxidation was about 25 kJ/mol higher than
that for the oxidation of methacrolein and isobutene. The rate constants for
the oxidation of isobutene and methacrolein were much greater than the rate
constant of the isobutane oxidation, indicating that the activation of an iso-
butane molecule can be the rate determining step. The activation energy calcu-
lated in the framework of this model was only about 5 kJ/mol lower than the
activation energy (90 kJ/mol) calculated by Paul et al. (189), who applied the
equation based on the MK model.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The results described in this paper give evidence that redox catalysts such as
vanadia supported on different oxides and Ni(Co)-M-O systems exhibit fairly
high activity in ODH of alkanes, and they are by nature rather selective in
this reaction; however, most of them also accelerate consecutive oxidation of
alkenes to carbon oxides, reducing selectivity to the desired product. The
addition of alkali promoters (especially potassium) modiﬁes the catalytic
activity and in many cases leads to an increase of selectivity to alkene. From
the kinetic point of view, the ODH reaction was almost always described by
the parallel-consecutive reaction network, in which both the selective
reaction (formation of alkene) and consequent oxidation to carbon oxides and
parallel direct formation of carbon oxides are taken into account. Kinetic inves-
tigations showed that COx is formed mainly by consecutive oxidation of alkene
and to a lesser extent on parallel route by direct oxidation of alkane. If products
of partial oxidation (containing oxygen) are formed, the reaction network
becomes more complicated, which is clearly visible in the case of ODH of
n- and iso-butane (145, 147, 151, 163). The redox models, like MK or its
surface version—the ER-SSAM model, are most frequently proposed for
describing of the kinetics of ODH of light alkanes. Other mechanisms such
as LH and ER are used rather scarcely and mainly for the kinetic description
of paths in ODH of alkanes in which COx is formed. The LH-type models,

which allow the adsorption both of alkane and oxygen, have been tried without
success in the description of ODH of propane (113, 134), and it is accepted that
adsorption of propane on the catalyst occurs on different sites than adsorption
of intermediates of the products. However, within the framework of the redox
model, some differences in the kinetic description of the ODH reaction are
observed depending on the type of alkane and catalyst.
For ODHE, which was studied on the VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3 catalysts,
both the MK and ER–SSAM models described the experimental data with a
similar precision. However, it should be stressed that some of the experimental
data are taken for a narrow range of conversions (104, 110), which limits the
application of the models in the description of the catalytic data. In
(107, 111) the two applied models were based on ample experimental data
and, as shown in Table 2, the calculated activation energies are relatively
close for both although they were built on different assumptions and the
vanadia catalysts were supported on different supports. Activation energies
calculated for this reaction in (104, 107) are very high, which could hint at a
considerable participation of a homogenous reaction in the ODHE and/or a dis-
crepancy between the model and experimental data.
It comes out from the papers quoted in this review that attempts have been
undertaken to describe the kinetics of ODH of propane and butane by several
models such as MK, LH, ER, and ER-SSAM. Some of the models are complex,
i.e., different mechanisms are used to describe different stages of the reaction.
For example, the LH mechanism is used to describe stages that lead to the for-
mation of COx, and the MK mechanism is proposed for the formation of selec-
tive products (62, 120, 121). Such an approach seems to be consistent with the
IR and Ra results, which indicate that forms strongly adsorbed on the surface
are the intermediates of the total combustion products. However, most of the
authors applied the models where in all stages are described by the same mech-
anism (65, 113, 117, 128, 131, 135, 137, 144).
The redox models imply a mechanism in which the reduction of a catalyst
by a reacting alkane molecule with extraction of lattice oxygen is the ﬁrst step
and is followed by reoxidation of the reduced catalyst with gaseous oxygen. In
the literature one can ﬁnd suggestions that selectivity of ODH reaction is
dependent on the activity of the alkyl species formed in the ﬁrst step of the
reaction of alkane. In most published kinetic models, it is assumed that
alkane interacts very weakly with the surface of the catalyst, as is postulated
in the ER model. These observations are supported both by an isotopic
exchange and DFT calculations (82, 136).
There is no such unanimity as to the nature of the next step of the ODH
reaction, which can lead to the formation of partially oxygenated products or
CO and CO2. Formation of the alkoxy species is considered by some as a
path that leads to the formation of oxygenated products, or to alkene by
others. Detailed progress of the ODH reaction depends, however, both on the

nature of the catalyst and the kind of alkane. For example, in the case of ODH
of propane over the VPO and VMgO oxide catalyst (40, 190), both isopropyl and
2-propyloxy surface species can be propene precursors. A path leading to the
formation of alkene is still subject to dispute, and nature and number of
steps leading to the formation of more complicated oxygenated compounds
and carbon oxides cannot be established because of lack of experimental data
in the literature (142, 190). Especially, the mechanism of carbon oxide for-
mation of is practically unknown and is usually treated in the described
kinetic models as a one-stage reaction, although IR, Ra, and other studies
show that this reaction is complex.
It is widely accepted that combustion reaction occurs with the participation
of adsorbed oxygen, and by the formation of the appropriate surface complexes
that are sufﬁciently bound to the surface of the catalyst. Some of authors,
however, consider that two forms of oxygen (electrophyllic-adsorbed oxygen,
nucleophyllic-lattice oxygen) are present on the surface of the catalyst.
Lattice oxygen is usually considered to be responsible only for selective reac-
tions but some authors link it both to selective ODH and total oxidation. In
the case of vanadia-containing catalysts, which are the systems most intensely
investigated in ODH of light alkanes, only one type of oxygen is responsible for
ODH and total combustion reactions. For example, in the case of ODH of
propane, out of nine papers that focus on the modeling of its kinetics, only
three assume the existence of two forms of oxygen on the catalyst surface
(115, 122, 125). This seems to correspond to the experimental result that
oxygen does not adsorb on oxidized vanadia catalysts but gaseous oxygen
oxidizes very quickly, and oxygen vacancies are formed in the course of ODH
reaction (191). But for other catalysts described above, containing transition
metal oxides, the existence of adsorbed oxygen is more probable and the role
of this type of oxygen may be important.
The ER-SSAM model offers a consistent explanation of the kinetics of the
ODH reaction for vanadia-supported catalysts (111, 118, 129, 134, 138). This
model is based on the assumption, suggested by transient experiments, that
alkane is not adsorbed at the catalyst surface and reacts directly from the
gas phase (ER mechanism). Stationary oxygen coverage is established at the
catalyst surface. In this approach, it is assumed that one type of oxygen is
responsible for both selective and nonselective reactions. The selective
reaction is a result of the alkane interaction with one surface oxygen, while
the nonselective reaction occurs by the concerted interaction of several
surface oxygens with an alkane molecule. Therefore, the rate of reaction
decreases with an increase in catalyst reduction degree, which in turn leads
to the observed increase in selectivity to alkene. Two possible mechanisms of
alkane interaction with catalyst surface oxygen were expressed in this model
by the different reaction orders with respect to oxygen surface coverage. For
the selective ODH reaction, the reaction order with respect to us was equal to

unity, while the combustion reactions would require any higher order, which
was taken as two in the discussed model. This model was successfully
applied to ODH of propane and ethane over vanadia catalysts, both pure and
doped by alkalis (K, Rb), supported on different supports (titania, silica). The
results obtained within the framework of this model allowed one to partly elu-
cidate the role of alkali additives.
It is widely believed that selectivity to alkene can be controlled by the acid-
base character of a catalyst, which can be modiﬁed by appropriate additives or
by the nature of the support. The importance of acid-base properties has been
conﬁrmed by results obtained for vanadium oxide, pure and alkali metal doped,
supported on titania, and for the VMgO systems. The positive effect of alkali
additives is mainly due to a poisoning effect they exert in most cases on
catalyst activity by blocking the active centers. Alkali metals located on the
surface of the active phase block the access of a reacting molecule to active
vanadia centers by a geometrical effect and by changing the electrostatic poten-
tial. The promoters may affect also the physicochemical properties of the cata-
lysts by modifying (decreasing) both their activity and reducibility with a
decrease in the electron charge on the oxygen ions.
These ﬁndings relate the reducibility and activity changes to the effect of
the additives on the basicity (nucleophilicity) of the catalyst oxygen. This con-
jecture is supported by calculations that have shown that the introduction of an
alkali metal into the catalyst led to a decrease of preexponential factors for all
the rate constants proposed in the ER-SSAM model. However, the preexponen-
tial factors for the total oxidation rate constants, especially for the consecutive
combustion of alkene, decreased to a higher degree than for the selective
reaction, which is the cause of the observed increase in catalyst selectivity
and the simultaneous decrease in catalyst activity. This effect is especially
visible for acidic supports and in the case of ODH of propane. It is related to
a hyperconjugation effect, which is possible in the case of a propene
molecule. This effect increases electron density on the double bond, increasing
in this way the basic character of propene, which in turn facilitates its deso-
rption from the surface and results in the increase of selectivity. For ODHE
there is no hyperconjugative effect and one can observe a lack of correlation
between alkali additives and selectivity to ethene. Additionally, a more difﬁcult
activation of an ethene molecule in comparison with other alkenes is also the
result of absence of the hyperconjugative effect, which causes the strengthen-
ing of C-H bonds in this molecule.
In all models published for the catalysts discussed in this review, the
reaction order with respect to alkane/alkene in the selective and non-selective
reactions was equal to one as it is suggested by ER mechanism, while the
reaction order with respect to gaseous oxygen was 0.5 or less. This suggests
that gaseous oxygen dissociates on the surface of catalyst, what is supported
by the results of the measurements of work function changes (56).

Analysis of the reported papers leads to the conclusion that the redox
model, particularly in the ER-SSAM version, is useful for clariﬁcation of the
mechanism of the ODH reaction. However, the proposed model can be
reﬁned by understanding in more depth molecular mechanisms of speciﬁc
stages of the reaction, in particular of the processes of the total oxidation of
alkanes/alkenes. On the other hand a formal and correct kinetic description
of the ODH reaction proposed by this model can be used in a search for the
factors favouring high activity and selectivity to alkene and employed in
designing the ODH process in the chemical engineering.

Problems of ODH of Light Alkanes
The conversion of light and saturated hydrocarbons to unsaturated ones is
a challenging pursuit in both economic and scientiﬁc terms. From a technical
point of view, the important task is to ﬁnd active and selective catalysts that
would allow meeting an increasing demand for oleﬁns. Over the past 20
years, many catalytic systems have been reported in patents and scientiﬁc pub-
lications. However, low yields in the ﬁnal product are the reason why industrial
interest in these processes is low. From scientiﬁc and industrial points of view,
there are several fundamental problems in ODH of light alkanes, which are
still waiting for a solution:
.
How to stop the reaction at the stage of desired compound (alkene) and to
eliminate its total oxidation, as the consecutive oxidation of alkene is the
main source of carbon oxides and is responsible for low selectivity of process.
.
How are selectivity and activity of the catalyst related to the mechanism of
this reaction.
To answer these questions, many speciﬁc problems have to be solved.
However, there are several aspects of the ODH process that are generally
accepted:
.
The reaction occurs by a parallel-consecutive scheme in which carbon
oxides are formed mainly by the consecutive overoxidation of alkenes.
The parallel oxidation of alkanes plays a lesser role.
.
The reaction proceeds by a redox mechanism—which can be described by
the MK or ER-SSAM models.
There are several other concepts and facts that are considered important
but signiﬁcant details of them are still under discussion:
1.
Relationship between selectivity and the reaction pattern.
2.
Inﬂuence of the multifunctionality of catalyst on its performance.

(3, 9, 56, 68, 179, 190, 192–195), but as yet there are no convincing and gener-
ally accepted recipes for well-performing catalysts and only general recommen-
dations can be found.
Ad.1. The kinetic investigation of the inﬂuence of additives on speciﬁc
stages of the ODH reaction may open the possibility of designing catalysts
that have appropriate relative rates of ODH and oxygen insertion and of inﬂu-
encing in this way the selectivity of ODH. However, data describing ODH of
alkanes are scarce and incomplete in the literature on the subject. This
review has revealed that only ODHP on vanadia catalysts is relatively well
described, but systematic studies of the effect of promoters on particular
stages of the ODH reaction are necessary for other systems.
Ad.2 To eliminate side reactions and consecutive combustion of alkene,
one should aim at obtaining multifunctional catalysts in which all stages of
the ODH reaction will proceed on the same or neighboring active centers
(192). In order to guarantee a selective pathway, the arrangement of multifunc-
tional catalytic centers must favor a quick transformation of the intermediates
without their overoxidation. Such a requirement can be fulﬁlled in catalysts in
which reaction sites are present near the adsorption sites, as in the V-P-O
catalyst for the oxidation of n-butane. However, such systems are rare and
attempts have been undertaken to attain similar results by introducing
additives to oxide catalysts (179).
Ad.3 The essential problem of the activation of a C-H bond in an alkane
molecule still remains an open question. It is known that the activation of
C-H bonds depends on the type of alkane. Unlike higher alkanes, ethane
contains only primary C-H bonds. In the case of propane and butane, for
which one secondary C-H bond is weaker than the primary C-H bond, the
ﬁrst step of activation is assumed to be the cleavage of a secondary C-H
bond. This cleavage may occur by a homolytic way (3, 68, 190) with the for-
mation of an adsorbed alkyl radical. Such radical species, depending on the
nature of the catalyst and temperature of reaction, are capable of yielding
alkene by a surface reaction or directly after desorption into the gas phase
(190) and references therein]. High temperatures favor the alkyl desorption
route, whereas low temperatures and reducible catalysts promote surface
reactions.
Heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond is the second possible method of
alkane activation (3, 190, 195) considered in the literature. Heterolytic acti-
vation of alkane requires the presence of strong basic sites on the surface of
R. Grabowski

the catalyst, which enables the abstraction of a proton. However, it is disputa-
ble whether it is the nucleophilicity of oxygen or the electrophilicity of metal
that is the decisive factor in splitting the C-H bond in the alkane molecule.
There is still disagreement over which of the two ways is more probable. For
example, Finocchio et al. (73) or Garrone and co-workers (196) concluded
that C-H bond cleavage occurs most likely by heterolytic splitting. Several
other authors (197) however, suggest that strongly basic sites readily adsorb
CO2, may be quickly deactivated, and therefore cannot take part in such acti-
vation of the C-H bond.
In conclusion one can say that many several proposed mechanisms assume
the existence of propyl and propyloxy species on the surface of catalyst
(40, 190). Their relative concentration depends on the oxidizing power of the
oxide catalysts. As suggested in (40) selectivity to propene depends on the
nature of oxide and probably also on the structure of its surface. The ﬁrst
route of propane activation involves its dissociative adsorption as isopropyl
or 2-propylooxy species, which lead to the formation of propene. The second
route involves also dissociative adsorption of propane but as 1-propyloxy
species. These species, according to the authors, are the precursors of
propene or oxygen-containing organic compounds. The other steps (their
number and nature) cannot be discussed because of the lack of experimental
data. Therefore, the question of the mechanism of alkane activation still
remains open.
Ad.4. The dependence of selectivity to a desired product on the form and
properties of species participating in the reaction is yet another topic of discus-
sion. As stated in this review, the ODH reaction of lower alkanes occurs
through a redox mechanism. The question of which oxygen takes part in the
activation of alkane and what happens next with the activated molecule is
still under discussion. The nature of the active site is also still being discussed.
There are some data for vanadia-based catalysts, but for other systems the data
are rather scarce. Even in the case of VMgO, which is the most extensively
studied catalytic system, the nature of active sites is still under debate. For
example, a short, terminal V¼O bond is proposed by Sew Hew Sam et al.
(38) as a site at which the abstraction of hydrogen from C-H bond is initiated,
whereas V-O-V oxygen bridges participate in the next steps when water is
formed. On the other hand, Kung and Kung (36) proposed the terminal
vanadyl bond to be responsible for total oxidation and the bridged oxygen
atoms to be selective sites for propene. For the vanadia-supported catalyst
(59), in turn, it was proposed that V-O bonds in the tetrahedral or octahedral
coordination are responsible for selective oxidation, whereas the V-O bonds
near a V¼O bond lead to oxygenate products.
The acid-basic properties of catalysts also have a distinct inﬂuence on their
activity and selectivity. It is well known that basic or neutral catalysts increase
the possibility of desorption of oleﬁn as the ﬁnal product and conﬁne the side

reactions. The acid-base character of catalysts is modiﬁed by the nature of
metal oxide support (68) and also by the additives. As is known, the introduc-
tion of additives may modify not only the acid-basic properties, but also the
forms of oxygen species, reducibility of catalyst, and the rate of electron
transfer within the catalyst and between the catalyst and adsorbed species
(179). This effect may vary, depending on the location of an additive in a
catalyst (bulk or surface of catalyst) and also on its concentration. The role of
additives is generally known, but more systematic studies on an extended
range of additives of different electronic structures may open a perspective of
increasing the activity and selectivity in alkane ODH.
More extensive fundamental studies should be undertaken on the particu-
lar steps of ODH, not only on vanadia-based catalysts, which are relatively well
known, but also on other systems. In particular, the role and inﬂuence of differ-
ent promoters and modiﬁcations exerted by them, especially under working
conditions, need to be elucidated. It would be important to undertake kinetic
studies to determine the inﬂuence of speciﬁc factors on the particular stages
of the ODH reaction, but other techniques are even more important. Especially,
surface techniques combined with quantum chemistry calculations can
increase our knowledge and lead to a better understanding of mechanism of
the ODH reaction. Furthermore, the literature lacks data on catalytic proper-
ties such as mobility of lattice oxygen, redox potentials of reduced states, and
concentrations and strengths of acid-base surface sites. These data are
needed for the development of a quantitative basis for a future theory that
would help in designing new, better catalysts.
