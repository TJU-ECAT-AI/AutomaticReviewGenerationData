Preface
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is today at the centre of attention of the scientiﬁc and
technological world because of its potential role in climate change, which is
supposed to be, directly or indirectly, caused by the growing level of CO2 in the
atmosphere. Policy-makers work out solutions ranging over a large number of
options, including carbon capture and disposal or sequestration (CCS) or carbon
capture and utilization (CCU).
The conversion of CO2 into added-value products (chemicals, materials, fuels) is
today one of the most widespread research themes, and the scientiﬁc literature
presents a large number of reviews, papers and books that disclose the CO2
chemistry or, in general, utilization. Industry is also much involved, as witnessed
by the ever growing number of industrial patents and new processes.
Despite the large number of volumes published, an organized collection of
information about the mechanisms concerning the many reactions in which CO2
is involved does not exist. However, this book has been designed with the precise
idea of ﬁlling the gap and collecting the knowledge we have of the reaction
mechanism of CO2 conversion when it is used either as a building block for the
production of chemicals and materials, or as a carbon source for C1 and Cn energy-
rich molecules.
This book covers 40 years of research efforts in understanding the reactivity of
CO2. Its aim is not to present an exhaustive list of all reactions in which CO2 can be
involved, even if it shows quite a large number of them, but to analyze the
thermodynamics and kinetics of its conversion.
The book is organized in ten chapters, each devoted to a particular subject.
References point the reader to more speciﬁc issues or more general applications.
Chapter 1 presents the CO2 molecule and gives fundamental information for
understanding the chemistry of the heterocumulene. It also discusses the excited
states of CO2 and its radical anion and radical cation. Such species are often
encountered in other chapters. The spectroscopic techniques (infrared, ultraviolet,
nuclear magnetic resonance) used for collecting information about the state of the
vii
CO2 moiety in the products are introduced here, and applied in the following
chapters.
Chapter 2 discusses the co-ordination of CO2 to metal centres in various tem-
perature conditions and the effects of such interaction on the heterocumulene
structure. It addresses the question of whether preliminary co-ordination of CO2
to a metal centre is an essential prerequisite for CO2 conversion.
In Chap. 3 the interaction of CO2 with selected electron-rich moieties such as:
H–, OH, NR2
, R3C, RO and NRR0R00 is presented. This chapter discusses
reactions not mediated by a metal centre, which are discussed extensively in the
following chapter.
Chapter 4 is dedicated to the analysis of the interaction of CO2 with E–X bonds,
where E–X¼M–H, M–R, M–OH, M–OR, M–O2, M–M, C–C, C–O, N–H, N–C, N–
P and Si–H. The analysis of such elementary steps is a bridge to the more general
aspect of reactivity of CO2. Such reactions illustrate the role of metals in initiating
the reactions and give the fundamentals for understanding the use of CO2 in
synthetic chemistry under catalytic conditions.
Chapter 5 covers the topic of CO2 interaction with multiple C–C bonds (alkenes,
alkynes, cumulenes and conjugated dienes) relevant to carboxylation reactions with
formation of new C–C bonds and to the synthesis of ﬁne chemicals or
intermediates.
Chapter 6 is dedicated to the synthesis of organic carbonates, linear and cyclic,
molecular compounds and polymeric materials, and of polyurethanes. Organic
carbonates (monomeric) ﬁnd a wide use in various sectors of the chemical and
energy industries. Polymers, which can be considered as chemical sinks of CO2,
ﬁnd a continuously growing application in architecture and are used for making
CDs, sanitary tools and laboratory glassware, among others. Polyurethanes play a
key role as insulators and packaging materials.
Chapter 7 introduces the high-temperature processes of CO2 conversion: Dry
Reforming of Methane (DRM) and the relevant general use of CO2 as oxidant or
dehydrogenating (DH) agent. The conversion of CO2 into methanol is discussed
here as it has similarities to the other processes. Such applications deal with the
conversion of large volumes of CO2 into fuels or energy-rich molecules.
Chapter 8 deals with the 1e2e transfer to CO2 in electrochemical, photo-
chemical, photo-electrochemical processes, a topic of great importance for the
conversion of CO2 into energy-rich molecules. This chapter is relevant to the use
of perennial energy sources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro-energy, in the
conversion of large volumes of CO2. The use of solar energy brings about the
man-made photosynthesis (direct and indirect) which is the future technology for
the conversion of large volumes of CO2 into chemicals and fuels.
Chapter 9 makes the analysis of bioprocesses (enzyme catalysed reactions) in
which CO2 is converted. Carboxylation processes and reduction of CO2 to other
C1-molecules such as HCOOH, H2CO, CH3OH and CH4 are discussed here. A
comparison to chemical processes discussed in previous chapters is straightforward.
Chapter 10 presents quite a new subject: the properties of hydrate-CO2. This
topic is a frontier research area and has great potential in the recovery of methane
viii
Preface
from hydrates. Only a limited amount of information exists in the scientiﬁc and
technical literature, but the interest for future applications is very high.
In its entirety, this book presents the essential knowledge of the CO2 conversion
reaction mechanisms. We believe that it will be of great help to those who are
newcomers in the fascinating ﬁeld of carbon-cycling (CO2 conversion) mimicking
Nature and be for all readers a guide to discovering aspects of the recent history of
CO2 chemistry, a topic of great interest today for its potential impact on avoiding
CO2 emissions and reducing fossil carbon extraction.

The Carbon Dioxide Molecule
Abstract The basic aspects of the reactivity of carbon dioxide (CO2) are featured
in this chapter and related to the electronic structure of the molecule. The electronic
properties of neutral CO2 are compared with those of the radical ionsCO
2 andCOþ
2 .
The potential of a few spectroscopic techniques (infrared, ultraviolet–visible,
nuclear magnetic resonance) in the characterization of CO2 states is also
highlighted.
1.1
Introduction
The carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule is a relatively simple molecular system.
Nevertheless, much of the life on Earth, as well as the fate of our planet itself,
depends heavily on the properties of this small triatomic C1 molecule.
Large amounts of CO2 (~700 gigatonnes/year), are involved in the natural
C-cycle, which includes the production of biomass by photosynthesis, biological
respiration, carbonization processes, and so on. CO2 is the waste end product of
several human activities (e.g., fossil combustion, cement manufacture, fermenta-
tion, industrial processes). Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, in the
second half of the nineteenth century, anthropogenic emissions of CO2 have been
growing continuously, reaching the level of more than 35 gigatonnes/year.
Together with the indiscriminate deforestation of large areas of land, this has
brought about a continuous increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere,
which is known to contribute severely to climate change. Much effort is currently
being devoted to setting up efﬁcient strategies to reduce emission/accumulation of
CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 chemical utilization (CCU), which is aimed at
converting the heterocumulene into fuels or other valuable products, is currently
under assessment as a sustainable technology for reducing waste and making better
use of both carbon and energy.
There is, however, a net dichotomy between the sophisticated facilities exploited
by Nature to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and the difﬁculties experienced
by chemists in converting the heterocumulene through efﬁcient catalytic processes.
CO2 reduction, or, more generally, CCU, is a challenging task and not only mere

electrochemical,

electrochemical approaches are currently under investigation. A great deal of effort
is also addressed to converting this molecule by trying to mimic Nature.
In tackling the problem of CCU, it is of fundamental importance to have a clear
view of the basic features of the reactivity of this molecule, which is strictly related
to its electronic conﬁguration. This chapter confronts this issue.
1.2
Electronic Properties of CO2
1.2.1
Ground State of Carbon Dioxide
In its electronic ground state, the CO2 molecule is linear and belongs to the point
group D1h. Both carbon–oxygen bonds are equivalent with the equilibrium C–O
distance of 1.1600 Å, as obtained from an analysis of infrared (IR) spectra and
conﬁrmed by electron diffraction [1, 2]. Both carbon–oxygen bonds are polar as a
result of the presence of net partial charges on the carbon and oxygen atoms [3,
4]. However, the molecule has no permanent electric dipole. In fact, the dipole
moments associated with each of the C–O bonds cancel each other because they
have equal magnitude but opposite directions because of the linear molecular
geometry (Fig. 1.1).
The
molecule
has
an
electric
quadrupole
[5],
whose
moment
is
4.3  1026 esu/cm2 [6] and thus exhibits signiﬁcant intermolecular interactions,
which may account for the formation of neutral aggregates. Neutral clusters of
(CO2)n (2  n  5) have been produced in a molecular beam expansion system and
observed via mass spectrometry [7, 8]. The intermolecular interactions can become
even stronger when a cationic or anionic CO2 molecule interacts with other CO2
molecules, affording positively or negatively charged intermolecular aggregates,
which may be regarded, respectively, as models for solvated COþ
2 radical cations or
solvated CO2
 radical anions [7–11]. Positively charged aggregates of (CO2)n
+
(2  n  10) have been generated by nucleation of neutral CO2 molecules to CO2
+
radical cation in a superionic expansion [9]. The stability of these clusters is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of neutral aggregates. The anionic clusters are also
rather stable [10]. In contrast to the CO2
 radical anion, which is unstable with
respect to electron detachment (see Sect. 1.4), the dimeric species (CO2)2
 is stable
by 0.9 eV, and stability increases with increasing cluster size.
The electronic conﬁguration of the linear ground state, 1Σg
+, of CO2 is as shown

The Carbon Dioxide Molecule
The values in parentheses provide an approximate estimate of CO2 molecular
orbital (MO) energies evaluated by measuring the ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy
for Chemical Analysis) ionization energies for the molecule [12–14]. The ESCA
spectrum does not allow one to measure any energy splitting for the molecular
orbitals 3σg and 2σu because of the inherent broadening of these levels. Neverthe-
less, calculations clearly indicate that 3σg has a lower energy than 2σu [3, 4, 15–
18]. Both 3σu and 1πu MOs are very close in energy, with the 3σu MO slightly more
stable than the 1πu. This conclusion is also supported by several computational
studies. In general, the calculated values of orbital energies are usually affected by
the computational approach used. Using more extended basis sets in calculations
allows one to reproduce the correct energy ordering of the 3σu and 1πu levels [3, 4,
15–18].
Figure 1.2 shows a qualitative energy diagram for the valence shell MOs of the
CO2 molecule. The atomic orbitals (AOs) on oxygens and carbon, which are
considered in bond formation, are 2sO (32.4 eV) and 2pO (15.9 eV), and 2sC
(19.4 eV) and 2pC (10.7 eV), respectively. The K-shell orbitals of oxygens and
carbon are not taken into account because they lie very low on the energy scale:
they remain basically unchanged in the molecule and become 1σu, 1σg, and 2σg. In
the linear molecule six σ molecular orbitals are generated by combining six atomic
orbitals, consisting of 2s and 2pz (directed along the internuclear axis) of all three
atoms. These MOs are marked in Fig. 1.2 as 3σg, 4σg, 5σg, 2σu, 3σu, and 4σu. The
remaining 2px and 2py orbitals form three doubly degenerate π-orbitals denoted as
1πu, 1πg, and 2πu.
Schematic and simpliﬁed representations of the CO2 molecular orbitals are
shown in Fig. 1.3. Figure 1.4 illustrates qualitatively the variation of the MO
energies with the change of OCO bond angle (diagram of Walsh [19]) and the
correlation of symmetry representations of the molecular orbitals of CO2 among the
point groups associated with the linear (D1h) and bent (C2v) conﬁguration.
The main contributors to the energy lowest valence molecular orbital, 3σg(3a1),
are the 2sO and 2sC atomic orbitals, with a minor contribution from the 2pzO AOs.
The 2σu(2b2) MO is mainly a bonding combination of 2sO AOs and the 2pzC
AO. This molecular orbital presents a nodal plane passing through the central
carbon and perpendicular to the molecular axis. The 4σg(4a1) and 3σu(3b2) MOs
contain C–O antibonding combinations of 2sO with 2sC and 2pzC, respectively, but
they are compensated by strong admixture of bonding 2pzO states (see Fig. 1.3).
The doubly degenerate 1πux(1b1) and 1πuy(5a1) orbitals are, respectively, bond-
ing combinations of 2px and 2py states on all the three atoms. The 1πux(1b1) MO is
equivalent to the 1πuy(5a1) orbital in the linear conﬁguration, but it is rotated by 90
about the internuclear axis. In the linear conﬁguration the doubly degenerate

1πgx(1a2) and 1πgy(4b2) molecular orbitals are equivalent and reciprocally rotated
by 90 about the molecular axis. They have no weight on the carbon atom, and play
the role of lone pairs. The 1πgx(1a2) MO consists of an antibonding combination of
2pxO AOs, whereas the 1πgy(4b2) MO is an antibonding combination of 2pyO AOs.
The ﬁrst unoccupied molecular orbitals are the two 2πu MOs. Both of them are
degenerate and equivalent in the linear conﬁguration. The 2πux(2b1) MO has mainly
a 2pxC character with a little contribution from the 2pxO AOs. Besides a nodal plane
passing through the internuclear axis, this molecular orbital has nodal planes
intersecting each CO bond, because the starting atomic orbitals are combined in
an antibonding manner. The 2πuy(6a1) MO is equivalent to the 1πu(1b1) MO in the
linear conﬁguration, but it involves the 2py AOs of all the three atoms.
Both the 5σg(7a1) and 4σu(5b2) MOs are strongly antibonding. The 5σg(7a1) MO
is made up of 2sC AO and 2sO and 2pzO AOs combined in an antibonding manner
and shows four nodal planes perpendicular to the internuclear axis, which intersect
the two oxygen atoms and the two C–O bonds. The 4σu (5b2) MO consists of 2pz
AOs from all three atoms with a 2sO AO contribution.
The 16 valence electrons of CO2 are distributed over the four σ orbitals (8 elec-
trons) 3σg, 2σu, 4σg, and 3σu and the four π-orbitals (8 electrons) 1πu and 1πg. Of the
eight occupied molecular orbitals, both 3σg and 2σu are responsible for the
σ-bonding skeleton of the molecule, whereas the 1πu orbitals account for the C–O
π-bonds. By contrast, the electrons 4σg, 3σu, and 1πg are, respectively, σ and π lone
pairs. This interpretation agrees with a few features of the ESCA spectrum of CO2.

(4σg) in the ESCA spectrum [12–14] is consistent with their assignment to electrons
largely localized on the end oxygen atoms. Conversely, the level associated with
the band at 17.6 eV (1πu), which is broad and exhibits a ﬁne vibrational structure,
has apparently a bonding character.
Figure 1.4 shows that the energies of both occupied and unoccupied molecular
orbitals may undergo signiﬁcant alterations upon bending the molecule from linear
geometry. In general, the energies of the σ-orbitals increase or are almost unaf-
fected upon the change of geometry from linear to bent. However, the behavior of
the π-orbitals is somewhat more diversiﬁed and their energies exhibit more signif-
icant changes. The degeneracy of the π-orbitals is lost in the bent geometry and each
couple
of
formerly
equivalent
and
degenerate
π-orbitals
splits
in
two
non-equivalent orbitals with different energies. The splitting is relatively modest
for both 1πu and 1πg. In the case of 1πu orbitals, the destabilization of 1πu(5a1) is
roughly compensated by the stabilization of 1πu(1b1). By contrast, in the case of 1πg
orbitals, the energies of both components increase with diminution of the bond
angle. The energy increase upon bending is much faster for 1πg(4b2) than for
1πg(1a2). The rapid increase of the energy of 1πg(4b2) upon molecule bending
accounts for the linearity of the CO2 molecule in the ground state.

As for the 2πu MOs, the energy of the component 2πu(2b1) is only negligibly
affected by the extent of bending. However, bending causes a net decrease in the
energy of the 2πu(6a1) MO, which may become even more stable than 1πg(4b2). The
behavior of the 2πu(6a1) MO upon molecule bending is particularly intriguing as it
suggests that any event which enable the 2πu(6a1) level to be populated is also
expected to produce a distortion of CO2 molecule from linearity.
1.2.2
Lowest Excited States of Carbon Dioxide
The above statement ﬁnds a ﬁrst validation when considering the geometry of the
lowest excited states of the CO2 molecule [19–27]. Inspection of Fig. 1.2 shows that
the molecular orbital excitation of lowest energy for the CO2 molecule involves the
promotion of one 1πg electron into the 2πu MO. The resulting excited electronic

which correlate with A2 and/or B2 states in the point group of lower symmetry, C2v,
resulting from bending the molecule (Table 1.1).
According to the Walsh diagram of the molecule (Fig. 1.4), a few of the above
excited states (A2, B2) are expected to be strongly bent, whereas the others are
expected to be slightly bent or linear [19]. Spielﬁeldel et al. [21] studied the lowest
lying valence excited states of CO2 by ab initio calculations, and found that the
electronic energy depended critically on the geometric parameters of the nuclear
conﬁguration, such as the C–O bond distances and OCO bond angle. Using large
scale multireference conﬁguration interaction, the ordering of the lowest valence
excited states of CO2 was calculated to be 3B2, 3A2, 1A2, followed by 1B2. These
states have bent equilibrium structures. The calculated structural parameters of the
bent nuclear conﬁgurations characterizing the lowest excited states of CO2 differed
markedly from those of the electronic ground state, 1Σg
+, and are summarized in
Table 1.2 together with the available experimental data. According to the calcula-
tions, the lowest 1,3A2 and 1,3B2 states have much longer C–O equilibrium distances
(around 1.26 Å) than the electronic ground state (1.16 Å). Moreover, regardless of
the spin multiplicity, the B2 states (OCO bond angle  118) were found to be
markedly more bent than the A2 states (OCO bond angle  127).
Dixon [25], in 1963, identiﬁed the chemiluminescence observed in the CO ﬂame
to be ﬂuorescence from a bent 1B2 state correlated to the 1Δu state. The analysis of
the emission bands allowed one to measure the experimental excitation energy
(5.7 eV) and to determine the structural parameters of the bent conﬁguration (R
(CO) ¼ 1.25 Å; OCO angle ¼ 122). The values computed by Spielﬁeldel for the

11B2 state (E ¼ 5.74 eV, R(CO) ¼ 1.26 Å, OCO angle ¼ 118; Table 1.2) compare
well with the experimental results obtained by Dixon, fully supporting the Dixon
assignment.
Cossart-Magos et al. [22] analyzed the high resolution absorption spectrum of
gaseous CO2 between 6.2 and 7.1 eV (200–175 nm) and were able to show that this
part of spectrum is rich in very weak bands with a remarkable rotational structure.
They achieved a coherent analysis of nine perpendicular-type bands deﬁning an
excited state bending progression and identiﬁed a bent excited valence state,
different from that characterized by Dixon (11B2), which was characterized as a
1A2 state, rendered vibronically allowed by excitation of one quantum of the
asymmetric stretching v3(b2) vibration (Sect. 1.6.1). This state, which correlates
with the 1Σu
 state of the linear molecule, was the ﬁrst with this symmetry. The
structural parameters for the latter excited state were deduced from spectrum: the
C–O bond length decreased from about 1.26 Å to 1.22 Å, whereas the OCO bond
angle increased from about 129 to 138 depending on the wavelength of the
analyzed band. These results are consistent with the R(CO) and the OC
ˆ O values
of 1.262 Å and 127 calculated by Spielﬁeldel for the equilibrium geometry of the
11A2 state. The excitation energy for the 1A2 state (5.61 eV) calculated by
Spielﬁeldel was somewhat lower than the energy region where the 1A2 state was
detected, probably because the absorption spectrum analyzed by Cossart-Magos
et al. in the region of 6.2–7.2 eV involved transitions into highly excited vibrational
states.
Mohammed et al. [26], studying the continuum emitted in the spectral region
between 350 and 550 nm by CO2 molecules isolated in an Ar matrix at 4.7 K and
excited at 147 or 123.6 nm, assigned the continuum to the emission from the lowest
excited triplet state 3B2 of the bent CO2 molecule to the linear ground state. They
located the lowest triplet state of CO2 at 3.5  0.2 eV and measured its lifetime,
which was around 570 ms. The experimental value of 3.5  0.2 eV was close to that
(3.7 eV) calculated by Winter et al. [24] for the adiabatic excitation energy to the
lowest triplet state 3Σu
+(3B2) of CO2. In another of their studies, Cossart-Magos
et al. [27] reinvestigated the weak absorption spectrum of CO2 gas between 175 and
200 nm (see above) and focused on the parallel-type bands observed at 185.7 and
175.6 nm. The rotational structure of both bands was found to be consistent with the
assignment of both absorptions to the lowest triplet–singlet transition, 3B2  1P þ
g ,
excited with different quanta of the bending v2(a1) vibration. Table 1.2 gives, for the
13B2 state, the values obtained for the R(CO) bond length and OCO bond angle, as
deduced by the values of the rotational constants.

Main Features of Carbon Dioxide Reactivity
The molecular orbitals most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide
are the 1πg and 2πu orbitals, which play the role of HOMOs and LUMOs, respec-
tively. Although the doubly occupied non-bonding 1πg MOs are mainly localized
8
1
The Carbon Dioxide Molecule
on the end oxygen atoms, the empty antibonding 2πu orbitals are mostly centered on
the central carbon. CO2, therefore, is an amphoteric oxide, as, in principle, the
oxygen atoms can exhibit a Lewis base character, whereas the carbon atom can play
the role of a Lewis acid center. However, carbon dioxide is a better acceptor than
donor of electron density and, consequently, the reactivity of the molecule is
dominated by the electrophilic character of carbon rather than the weak nucleo-
philic properties of the oxygen atoms.
1.3.1
Carbon Dioxide as O-Nucleophile
A measure of the weak basic character of the oxygen atoms of CO2 is provided by
the value of proton afﬁnity of this molecule. The determination of this quantity for
CO2 has been the subject of both experimental measurements and theoretical
calculations [28–37]. The measured values range around the recommended value
of 540.5  2 kJ/mol [36], is appreciably lower than those found for other
O-containing molecules, such as, for instance, H2O, MeOH, Me2O, H2CO,

The hydroxycarbonyl cation HOCO+ (1.1) is certainly the simplest adduct in
which CO2 acts as an O-nucleophile. This “nonterrestrial” molecule is thought to be
an important intermediate species in
CO2 þ Hþ!HOCOþ

gas phase reactions in interstellar clouds and space [38]. Submillimeter wave
spectroscopy [39, 40] and infrared spectroscopy studies [41, 42] have deﬁnitively
shown that the interstellar lines observed in 1981 by Thaddeus et al. [43] in the
85 GHz region, and tentatively assigned to either HOCO+ or HOCN, belong to
HOCO+. By using different spectroscopic techniques, this molecule was shown to
be formed in ion-molecule reactions by proton transfer between CO2 and H3
+,
NH2
+, or HBr+ [44, 45].
The rotational spectra of HOCO+ support the hypothesis of a planar structure but
do not allow one to determine, experimentally, a precise and reliable structure for
this molecule and, more speciﬁcally, to distinguish between a structure I (H–

and a structure II (H–O1 ¼ 0.9766 Å, O1–C ¼ 1.2085 Å, C–O2 ¼ 1.1400 Å,
O1C
ˆ O2 ¼ 174.39, HȎ1C ¼ 119.38) with a trans conformation and a small bend
at the C atom [40]. Theoretical investigations agree on the fact that the OCO
backbone of this molecule is slightly bent, with a trans conﬁguration and the C–
O and C–OH bond distances being, respectively, shorter and longer than what was
observed in the non-protonated molecule [30–32, 46]. The equilibrium values for
the OCO and COH angles, as recently computed by Hammani et al. [46] using the
1.3

coupled electron pair approximation (CEPA) method with a correlation consistent
basis set, are respectively equal to 174.3 and 117.6, whereas the O–C, C–OH, and
O–H bond lengths are, respectively, 1.124, 1.229, and 0.984 Å. The positive charge
is mainly localized on the carbon and hydrogen atoms with the following
repartition: C, +0.584; H, +0.350; O, +0.012; (H)O, +0.054. Another recent com-
putational study [32], focusing on the protonation reaction of allenes and some
heteroallenes, has shown that end-on protonation of CO2 is by far more energeti-
cally favored than proton attack at the central carbon. Notably, carbon protonation
of the heterocumulene does not result in the formation of open forms, but affords a
cyclic cation with a very weak O–O (1.733 Å) bond and a very high positive charge
(+0.89) at the central CH unit.
In Chap. 2 several examples of O-coordinated CO2 to metal centers are
discussed. A peculiar feature relates the adducts of CO2 to other moieties (either
metal centers or other molecules or ions) and deserves attention. In fact, the
available structural data show unambiguously that, whenever CO2 behaves exclu-
sively as an O-nucleophile, the coordinated CO2 molecule essentially retains its
original linear geometry or undergoes only slight distortion from linearity. This
suggests that the interaction of CO2 with an electrophilic center through one of the
1πg lone pairs is not accompanied by any signiﬁcant back-donation of electron
density into the 2πu orbitals of the heterocumulene, which, therefore, are left empty.
End-on (η1-OCO) coordination mode has remained elusive for a long time.
Nevertheless, this coordination mode may play an important role in biological
systems. In photosynthetic CO2 ﬁxation, an oxygen-bound CO2 ligand has been
proposed to be enzymatically reduced by ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase-
oxygenase (RuBisCO) [47]. A crystallographic study on a deacetoxycephalosporin
C synthase (DAOCS) mutant showed the presence of electron density close to the
iron center of the active site, which was found to be consistent with the presence of
a monodentate O-coordinated CO2 molecule [48].
1.3.2
Carbon Dioxide as C-Electrophile
η1-C coordination of CO2 to metal centers has been clearly shown and is discussed
in Sect. 2.3. The structural data of the adducts indicate an important pouring of
electron density from metal ﬁlled d-orbitals into the empty antibonding 2πu(6a1)
orbital, which weakens the C–O bonds and, as expected from the Walsh diagram
(Fig. 1.4), causes a remarkable bending of the coordinated CO2 molecule. Analo-
gous structural changes always mark the geometry of the CO2 molecule whenever
the electrophilic carbon atom of the heterocumulene is involved in an interaction
with electron-rich species (amines, alcohols, carbanions, etc.).
This interaction also affects the nucleophilicity of the O atoms of CO2. For
instance, in CO2-adducts with amines or alcohols, the resulting carbamate or
10
1
The Carbon Dioxide Molecule
carbonate anions, under suitable conditions, can easily react with C-electrophiles to
give organic carbamates [49, 50] or carbonates [51], respectively (see Chap. 4).
1.3.3
Amphoteric Reactivity of Carbon Dioxide
Most frequently, however, the reactivity of CO2 fully reveals the intrinsically
amphoteric nature of the molecule. Side-on (η2-C,O) coordination of CO2 to
metal complexes (Fig. 1.5) clearly exempliﬁes this behavior. Different schemes
can be proposed for describing the metal–CO2 ligand bond in these systems. These
adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles resulting from a
formal oxidative addition of one of the π-bonds of the cumulene to the metal center:
in this case, both the metal center, which increases by two units its formal oxidation
state, and CO2 ligand act simultaneously as both electron acceptor and electron
donor. Otherwise, (η2-C,O)-adducts can be regarded, more realistically, as
π-complexes, wherein the metal–CO2 interaction is reminiscent of that character-
izing the metal–oleﬁn bond and involves both electron donation from the
O-centered 1πuy(5a1) and 1πgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty d-orbitals of the
metal center and, to a greater extent, electron back-donation from a ﬁlled
d-orbital of metal to the empty carbon centered 2πuy(6a1) orbital of the ligand
[52]. Whatever model may be followed, in these systems the CO2 ligand always
acts simultaneously as electron donor through an end-oxygen and electron acceptor
at the central carbon. Several examples are discussed in Chap. 2.
It may be worth mentioning the behavior of solid CO2 under very high pressures
[53–59]. CO2 is a very stable compound, which, in the solid state, can exist in
different molecular phases (CO2-I (dry-ice) to CO2-IV, and CO2-VII) depending on
pressure and temperature [53]. At very high pressure, the π molecular bond is
replaced by an extended network of C–O single bonds. In 1999, a few experiments
showed that CO2-III, conﬁned inside a diamond anvil cell under 40 GPa pressure
and subjected to laser heating (ca. 1800 K), was transformed into a new crystalline
“super-hard” phase, called CO2-V [55], which can be quenched at ambient temper-
ature. The crystal structure of CO2-V was found to be orthorhombic (P212121),
analogous to that of SiO2 tridymite (a distorted high temperature phase of β-quartz)

[56]. The new phase is composed of CO4 tetrahedra, where each carbon atom is
bonded to four oxygen atoms at a carbon–oxygen distance of 1.36 Å at 40 GPa and
an O–C–O angle of 110. The C–O–C angle of 130 is markedly smaller than those
of SiO2 tridymites (174–180) or quartz (145). CO2-V is a “super-hard” polymeric
form of CO2. Accordingly, the bulk modulus for CO2-V (362 GPa) is higher than
for any of the SiO2 polymorphs and very close to that of cubic-BN (369 GPa).
More recently, the synthesis of an amorphous, silica-like form of carbon dioxide
(a-CO2), which is called “a-carbonia” [57], has been reported. This material is
homologous to other Group 14 dioxide glasses (a-SiO2; a-GeO2). Both CO2-V and
a-CO2 convert back to the molecular state when pressure and temperature are
brought back to ambient values.
Recent results suggest that carbon dioxide polymerization does not occur via
intermediate states where molecules gradually distort as pressure increases, but is
most likely caused by solid-state chemical reactions between CO2 molecules
[59]. Such studies are important to gain better insight into transformations of
light element-based molecules under high pressure and temperature and may
open up new horizons in solid state chemistry under extreme conditions.
1.4
Carbon Dioxide Radical Anion, CO2

Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center results generally in marked
modiﬁcation of the bond properties (CO bond lengths, OCO angle, etc.) of CO2
ligand and provides the heterocumulene in an “activated form” (Chap. 2). Conver-
sion of CO2 to CO2
 anion is another important mode of activating carbon dioxide
molecule, and represents the ﬁrst of the reactive steps leading to the partial or full
reduction of the heterocumulene (Chap. 8).
Carbon dioxide anion is a radical species, isoelectronic with NO2. Qualitative
arguments, such as those based on the Walsh rules [19] (see Sect. 1.2.1), predict a
bent equilibrium geometry (C2v symmetry) with elongated CO bonds for CO2
 in
the 2A1 ground state, which may be expressed as (1a1)2 (1b2)2 (2a1)2 (3a1)2 (2b2)2
(4a1)2 (3b2)2 (1b1)2 (5a1)2 (1a2)2 (4b2)2 (6a1)1 (see also Fig. 1.4). This is supported
also by quantum-mechanical studies [60–67]. According to a recent theoretical
analysis at B3LYP6-31-G**//B3LYP/6-31G* level [65], the charge density distri-
bution of CO2
, from a natural population analysis (NPA), shows negative char-
acter for the two O atoms (0.76e) and a positive charge on the C atom (+0.52e).
Spin (densities) populations indicate a 68 % electron delocalization on the C atom
and 16 % on each oxygen. CO2
 is, therefore, a radical-like species at carbon and
basic at oxygen. Accordingly, calculations also show that O-protonation of the
radical anion, which affords the hydroxycarbonyl radical OCOH, is favored over
C-protonation, which should result in the formation of the less stable formiloxy
radical HCOO [60, 66]. These studies also show that trans-OCOH is more stable
than the cis-isomer and barely bound with respect to the H + CO2 asymptote [60,
66, 67].

existence of
CO
2!CO2 þ e
ð1:2Þ
metastable autodetaching CO2
 anion in the gas phase was ﬁrst noted by Paulson
[68] by studying the reactions of the O ion with CO2. Afterwards, Cooper and
Compton [69, 70] observed the formation of metastable, autodetaching CO2
 ions
in collisions of electrons or Cs atoms with organic molecules, such as cyclic
anhydrides (maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride), which contained nonlinear
OCO units. The lifetimes of the generated species, measured with a time-of-ﬂight
spectrometer, were in the range 30–60 μs. A subsequent study on CO2
 ions formed
in collisions of alkali metal atoms with linear CO2 molecules resulted in a mean
lifetime of 90  20 μs and a value of 0.6  0.2 eV for the adiabatic electron
afﬁnity (EAad) of the CO2 ground state [71]. The measured value for EAad agrees
well with the value of 0.67 eV computed by Gutsev et al. [4] and should be
compared with the markedly higher value of the vertical electron afﬁnity (3.6 eV,
as determined by means of electron scattering measurements) [72]. The large
difference between the two values can be understood from the large stabilization
of CO2 upon bending. The reason for the relatively high stability of the anion is
ascribed to the barrier caused by the change in molecular geometry on going from
the 2A1 state of CO2
 to the ground state of CO2, which has been calculated by
Pacanski et al. to be 0.4 eV [61]. Therefore the CO2
 molecule in its equilibrium
geometry is metastable, being stabilized kinetically.
Ovenall and Whiffen [73] ﬁrst produced CO2
 in solid matrix by irradiation of
sodium formate crystals with γ-rays at room temperature. Their ESR experiments
allowed them to ascertain that the CO2
– anion is bent with a bond angle of 134 and
has a 2A1 ground state. From the experimental values of 13C hyperﬁne coupling
coefﬁcients and g values they derived the coefﬁcients for the mixing of atomic
orbitals in the half-ﬁlled 6a1 molecular orbital, occupied by the odd electron. The
6a1 molecular orbital proved to be 14 % carbon 2s, 66 % carbon 2pz, and 10 % for
each oxygen 2pz. Chantry and Whiffen studied the UV–Vis absorption spectrum of
CO2
– trapped in sodium formate [74]. The radical anion did not absorb in the visible
region, but it did in the accessible UV region not obscured by matrix absorption
(λ > 240.0 nm). Three maxima were found at 340.0, 280.0, and 255.0 nm, the ﬁrst
being assigned to the 2b1(2B1)  6a1(2A1) transition. The assignments of the
absorptions
at
280

or
2b1(2B2)  4b2(2A1)
or
5b2(2B2)  6a1(2A1)) and at 255.0 nm (7a1  6a1 or 6a1  5a1) were less certain.
Hartman and Hisatsune [75] observed the infrared spectrum of CO2
 which they
produced by γ-irradiation of sodium formate in alkali halide pressed disks. From the
asymmetric stretching frequencies observed for 12C and 13C isotopomers they
computed a bond angle of 127  8 and obtained a value of 8.40 mdyn/Å for the
force constant of the asymmetric stretching frequency. The experimental data also
allowed an estimation of the C–O bond length (1.25 Å), which is markedly longer

than that measured for CO2. At room temperature, the decay half-life of the radical
anion in a KBr disk was estimated to be over 1 year.
The CO2
 radical anion reacted easily with water, giving hydrogen carbonate
and formate anions (1.3), but, under anhydrous conditions, it decayed by a bimo-
lecular process to afford CO3
2 and CO [76].

The rate constants, determined by IR spectroscopy in the range 370–488 K, were
109.4  0.1exp[(18.9  0.2)/RT] and 106.6  0.1exp[(11.9  0.2)/RT] M1 s1 for
KCl and KBr matrices, respectively [76]. Only in KCl was oxalate ion observed as a
minor reaction product.
The second-order kinetics for the decay of the CO2
 radical, under anhydrous
conditions, is consistent with the mechanism summarized by the reactions (1.4) and
(1.5). These reactions have also been proposed to explain the thermal decomposi-
tion pathway of oxalate ion in a KBr matrix. In the oxalate pyrolysis reaction, the
rate-determining step was the reverse of the reaction (1.5), which was ﬁrst-order in
oxalate and had an activation energy of 60 kcal/mol [77]. The subsequent step was
the rapid reaction (1.4) which was assumed to proceed through carbonylcarbonate
OCOCO2
2 dianion, a species isoelectronic with a known isomer of dinitrogen
tetroxide. Reaction (1.4) was proposed to be the dominant process for CO2
 decay
in KBr, where no oxalate was detected among the decay products. This matrix is not
effective in deactivating the oxalate ion formed by the exothermic forward reaction
(1.5). On the other hand, the presence of some oxalate among the decay products,
when the decay process of CO2
 was investigated in KCl, showed that the KCl
matrix was partially effective in promoting CO2
 decay also through reaction (1.5).

Callens et al. [78] detected CO2
 by ESR in KCl single crystals doped with
Na2
13CO3 after X-ray irradiation at room temperature. The radical anion, which
occupied an anion vacancy, had a bent geometry with an OCO angle of 130.5 and
rotated rapidly about its O–O axis. From the spectroscopic parameters they calcu-
lated the weights of 2sC and 2pzC orbitals contributing to the 6a1 molecular orbital
of the radical anion, which were found to be 11.8 % and 43.6 %, respectively. The
spin density on the oxygen atoms was found to be 0.45, not signiﬁcantly different
from that found for the oxygen atoms of NO2 in the same host lattice.
CO2
 radicals have also been detected by ESR in biological apatites (tooth
enamel, bone) and their synthetic analogues, when exposed to γ-rays, UV light, or
thermal treatment [79]. A general mechanism for the formation of the CO2
 radical
in apatites under different working conditions (γ-rays, UV, thermal treatment) has
been proposed and is summarized in Scheme 1.1. The precursors for CO2
 radical
formation are CO3
2 anions. By capturing a free electron, which originates from the

ionization of impurities by radiation/temperature, the CO3
2 ion is transformed into
a metastable short-lived CO3

Scheme 1.1 Mechanism of formation of CO2
 in apatites
Single crystals and polycrystalline samples of lithium formate monohydrate
(HCO2Li·H2O) were recently X-irradiated at 295 K and studied by using X-band
EPR, ENDOR, and ENDOR-induced EPR (EIE) spectroscopy at 200 or 295 K
[80]. The g- and 13C hyperﬁne coupling tensors of the CO2
 radical were deter-
mined. The 2s and 2p spin densities on the C-atom were estimated to be 0.15 and
0.48, respectively. A mechanism for the formation of the CO2
 radical was
proposed, which implies the ejection of an electron as the primary step, followed
by deprotonation, (1.6) and (1.7). Electron loss is most probably from the anion

previously suggested by Symons and coworkers [81] for the formation of CO2

upon γ-irradiation of thallium formate, (1.8)–(1.11). In the latter case, the formiloxy
radical is believed to form a hydrogen atom, which may attack a second formate ion
with generation of CO2
. According to this mechanism, electron capture by
formate anion should give radical anion HCO2
2. The latter species is extremely
unstable and yields CO2

Matrix isolation has been shown to be a very useful technique to stabilize CO2

generated by reduction of CO2 with alkali metal atoms during their codeposition at
low temperature in a neat or inert matrix [82–86]. An early matrix isolation
spectroscopic (IR) study on alkali atoms and CO2, codeposited at 14 K in solid
Ar, was conducted by Jacox and Milligan [82]. Further studies showed a rich
reactivity, except for sodium which was the least reactive among the alkali metals
(Li, Na, K, Cs) investigated.
The reaction of carbon dioxide with Li, Na, K, and Cs in rare gas and nitrogen
matrices leads to the reduction of the heterocumulene with formation of M+CO2

species. Two geometric isomers of Li+CO2
 were isolated in solid argon or krypton
1.4
Carbon Dioxide Radical Anion, CO2

15
[83, 84]. One has a C2v symmetry, consistent with a rhombus structure in which the
metal interacts symmetrically with both the oxygen atoms of CO2
, whereas in the
second isomer, showing Cs symmetry, the lithium center is bonded to only one of
the two oxygens. Upon photolysis with a Nernst glower IR source, Li+CO2
 (Cs) is
rearranged to the symmetric Li+CO2
 (C2v) isomer [83]. The other alkali atoms
(Na, K, Cs) formed only the M+CO2
 (C2v) isomer [85, 86]. These ﬁndings agree
with the results of a few theoretical studies by Jordan [87], who predicted two
geometric isomers for Li+CO2
, which are close in energy, with the C2v structure
being more stable than that having a Cs symmetry (energy stabilization with respect
to neutral CO2 and metal atom: 0.85 eV (C2v) vs 0.83 eV (Cs)). In contrast, for
Na+CO2
, the C2v geometry was computed to be signiﬁcantly more stable than the
Cs structure (energy stabilization with respect to neutral CO2 and metal atom:
0.34 eV (C2v) vs 0.14 eV (Cs)). The OCO bond angle for M+CO2
 (C2v) (M ¼ Li, K,
Cs) was calculated from the experimental IR spectra using the triatomic molecule
approximation [85]. The computed values of the OCO bond angle are close to 130
and depend on the matrix used and the nature of the alkali metal.
Under high metal concentrations, M2CO2 species can also form [83]. In the case
of Li, only the most stable Li2CO2 (Cs) isomer was produced. With other alkali
atoms (K, Cs), M2CO2 (C2v) molecules, having, most likely, a W-shape, also
formed [85, 86]. The CO2
2 bond angles calculated for K2CO2 (C2v) and Cs2CO2
(C2v) were, respectively, 125.9 and 123.2. M2CO2 (C2v) species (M ¼ Na, K, Cs)
can be photolytically converted to the corresponding M2CO2 (Cs) isomers by IR
radiation [85, 86]. It has been suggested that M2CO2 (C2v) forms via reaction of M2
molecules with CO2, as opposed to M2CO2 (Cs), which is produced by sequential
addition of M to MCO2 (C2v) [85]. In highly concentrated matrices, the formation
of oxalates M2C2O4 was also observed, which may decompose into M2CO3 and CO
upon annealing above 200 K.
The above discussion emphasizes that CO2
, which has a limited lifetime in the
gas phase, can be stabilized by interaction with a metal countercation. The nature of
the environment wherein CO2
 is trapped also signiﬁcantly affects the spectro-
scopic features of the radical anion [88–99]. For instance, ESR spectra of CO2

measured in different environments show that the 13C isotropic hyperﬁne coupling
constant (aiso) varies over a wide range depending on the environment. Moreover,
spin density is frequently found on a neighboring metal cation, and there are large
variations in the magnitude of aiso(M+) with the environment. With the purpose of
characterizing as closely as possible the unperturbed electronic structure of CO2
,
the radical anion was also isolated in gas rare matrices (Ne, Ar), free from any
interaction with alkali metal cations, and studied by ESR [96] and IR spectroscopy
[97–99]. The results of these experiments have emphasized substantial differences
with respect to those acquired under different conditions. FT-IR measurements [97–
99] on CO2
 samples generated as speciﬁed above have allowed the metal inde-
pendent absorptions of the radical anion to be identiﬁed (see also Sect. 1.6.1).
Notably, removal of the interaction with alkali metal cation, characteristic of
M+CO2
 ion pairs obtained through co-condensation experiments [82–86]
16

increased the antisymmetric stretching frequency of CO2

[75], and

photodetachment into the visible spectral region.
Of particular relevance to heterogeneous catalysis are both formation and char-
acterization of CO2
 radical anion at solid surfaces [100, 101]. Surface-stabilized
CO2
 radical is considered to play a key role in many photoreduction processes of
CO2 in the presence of semiconductor powders or TiO2 [102–107]. Recently Chiesa
et al. [108, 109] studied the activation of CO2 by excess electrons trapped at the
surface of an insulating oxide, such as polycrystalline MgO. A few morphological
features on the surface of this oxide, such as steps, corners, or reverse corners, are
able to promote, at temperatures as low as 77 K, the spontaneous ionization of H
atoms (for instance, generated from H2, under UV light) by stabilizing the two
fragments H+ and e, respectively, in the form of a surface hydroxyl unit and an
excess electron, which can be described as an ion pair (H+)(e). The surface of
MgO decorated by electron–proton pairs acquires an extraordinary chemical reac-
tivity leading to the reduction, by electron transfer of gaseous molecules to the
corresponding radical anions. Accordingly, CO2
 radical anion was generated from
CO2 at the surface of MgO by direct electron transfer from surface trapped excess
electrons and were characterized by CW-ESR spectroscopy [108]. The radical
anion showed bent structure with an angle of about 126. Both 13C and 17O
hyperﬁne structures were resolved for the ﬁrst time. This allowed one to obtain a
detailed mapping of the unpaired electron spin density distribution (mainly located
on the carbon atom) within the SOMO (Single Occupied Molecular Orbital) and to
ascertain the magnetic equivalence of the oxygen atoms. On the basis of the
experimental results it has been proposed that the CO2
 radical ion displays a
side-on structure with the two oxygen atoms symmetrically disposed with respect to
four- and three-coordinated Mg2+ ions at MgO edges, reverse corners, and corners.
A later pulsed ESR study showed that CO2
 radical ion can be stabilized by the
interaction with a nearby adsorbed proton (OH group) [109]. This was demon-
strated unambiguously by the small hyperﬁne interaction with the proton, detected
via matched three pulse and HYSCORE experiments. Based on the comparison of
measured and computed hyperﬁne (13C and 17O) and superhyperﬁne (1H) coupling
constants, the dominant species observed in the experiments should correspond to
CO2
 formed at three-coordinated Mg corner sites.
Single electron reduction of CO2 to CO2
 (1.12) is the ﬁrst, rate determining,
step in multielectron electrochemical reduction of CO2 to other valuable species,
such as formic acid,

2
ð1:12Þ
alcohols, hydrocarbons, CO, and oxalate [110–112]. Reaction (1.12) occurs at high
voltage (E(CO2/CO2
) ¼ 1.90 V) as a result of the large reorganizational energy
between the linear molecule and the bent radical anion [113]. Accordingly, CO2
electrochemical reduction does not occur easily and the really applied electrolysis
1.4
Carbon Dioxide Radical Anion, CO2

17
potentials for CO2 reduction are more negative than the thermodynamic values. The
fate of CO2
–, once formed, depends on several factors, such as concentration of
reactants, electrode potential, temperature, electrocatalyst material, and nature of
electrolyte solution (i.e., aqueous vs non-aqueous electrolyte). These aspects are
discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this book (see Chap. 8).
CO2
 can also be generated by ionizing radiation in aqueous solutions [114]. For
instance, the radical anion can be produced by reaction of hydroxyl radicals or H
atoms with formic acid/formate ion, hydroxyl radicals with carbon monoxide, or
solvated electrons with carbon dioxide [115]. In these experiments, the
hydroxycarbonyl radical OCOH can also form, (1.13)–(1.16). The latter radical is
the protonated form of the CO2
 radical anion (1.16). The pKa of OCOH has been a
matter of several experimental determinations resulting in signiﬁcantly different
values found for this quantity. A pKa (OCOH/CO2
) value of 2.3 has been quite
recently determined by von Sonntag et al. [115] by using pulse radiolysis with
conductometric detection.

In neutral to basic solutions the main product of the bimolecular decay of CO2

was found to be oxalate. In acidic solutions, in contrast, CO2 was formed. It was
generally believed that oxalate formation in neutral and alkaline solutions can occur
by head-to-head recombination at the carbon of CO2
 radical anions (1.5), whereas
disproportionation between two OCOH radicals (1.17) was assumed to be respon-
sible for the formation of CO2 in acidic solutions of formic acid. CO2 and formate
may also form by reaction between OCOH and CO2
, as shown in (1.18).

(1.4  109 dm3 mol1 s1) was found to be independent of pH in the range 3–8,
at constant ionic strength. The yields of the products of the bimolecular decay of the
carboxyl radicals, CO2 and oxalate anion, were found to depend strongly on the pH
of solution with an inﬂection point at pH 3.8. The observed pH dependence was
explained by considering a new mechanism, which involves a common carbanion
intermediate and is summarized in Scheme 1.2. A major feature of this mechanism
is that CO2
 radicals react mainly (>90 %) by head-to-tail recombination to give
the carbanion intermediate A, which may rearrange to oxalate or undergo a
competing proton-catalyzed disproportionation, which accounts for the formation

of CO2. According to the proposed mechanism, protonation of the intermediate A at
the oxygen atom (step (d)) should be faster than step (e). However, once B was
formed, it can undergo subsequent protonation at carbon (step (f)), possibly assisted
by a molecule of water, to give the mixed anhydride C, which decomposes to CO2
and formate.

Carbon Dioxide Radical Cation, CO2

Removal of a 1πg electron from the CO2 molecule results in the formation of the
CO2
+ radical cation in the ground state 2Πg. The energy required for this process is
13.79 eV [12–14, 116], which is much larger than that required for the formation of
the radical anion CO2
 (Sect. 1.4) or dissociation of neutral CO2 to CO and atomic
oxygen (Sect. 1.6.2). Spectroscopic measurements [117–120] show that CO2
+ in its
2Πg ground state is a linear molecule with D1h point group symmetry: the two C–O
bonds are equivalent with a length which is only slightly longer (1.1769 Å) than that
measured in the neutral molecule.
Removal of one electron from the inner orbitals 1πu, 3σu, 4σg of CO2 requires a
higher amount of energy [12–14, 116] (Sect. 1.2.1) and affords CO2
+ radical cation
in the excited states 2Πu, 2Σu
+, and 2Σg
+, respectively. The above excited states are
also linear (D1h) [117–125]. The experimental C–O bond distances for the 2Πu and
1.5
Carbon Dioxide Radical Cation, CO2
+
19
2Σu
+ excited states are, respectively, 1.228 and 1.180 Å. The available structural
data, as well as theoretical calculations [121–125], show that a signiﬁcant increase
in the carbon–oxygen bond length takes place, upon ionization, when the electron is
removed from the CO2 1πu orbital, in accordance with the strongly bonding
character of this orbital (Sect. 1.2.1), whereas a very modest change is found
when electron removal occurs from the orbitals 1πg, 3σu, or 4σg, which exhibit,
mainly or fully, non-bonding character (Sect. 1.2.1).
The carbon dioxide cation plays an important role in the dynamics of plasma
discharges and chemistry of planetary atmospheres [126]. In general, two possible
pathways can be distinguished in single ionization of CO2. The ﬁrst pathway
(non-dissociative ionization; see also above), affords CO2
+ ion, possibly in an
electronically and/or rovibrationally excited state (1.19). The vibronic structures
of CO2
+ in the various states have been studied by means of different experimental

techniques [127–129], such as emission, laser absorption, He(I) photoelectron,

pulsed ﬁeld ionization (PFI)–photoelectron (PE) (PFI–PE), PFI–PE–photoion
(PI) (PFI–PE–PI) coincidence measurements, and resonance-enhanced multiphoton
ionization.
However, CO2 molecule may also dissociate into a charged and a neutral
fragment (dissociative ionization; (1.20) and (1.21)). The dissociative ionization

Multiple ionization of the molecule might also occur in collisional processes and

of the molecular ion into two or three fragments [130].

IR Spectroscopy
The vibrational (and rotational) spectra of carbon dioxide have been investigated
extensively for their relevance to the study of planetary atmospheres [131–
135]. Moreover, IR spectroscopy is a useful technique for continuous recording
of carbon dioxide levels in the air and for analysis of remote sensing data.

The Carbon Dioxide Molecule
The linear triatomic molecule exhibits four normal vibration modes (3N5,
where N is the number of atoms in the molecule), which are shown in Fig. 1.6.
While the antisymmetric stretching (v3) and the doubly degenerate bending (v2)
modes are IR-active, the symmetric stretching mode (v1) is IR-inactive, as this
normal mode does not generate any change of the electric dipole moment of the
molecule (Sect. 1.2.1). In the IR spectrum of free carbon dioxide the antisymmetric
stretching frequency (v3) is found at 2349.16 cm1 in the gaseous state [136] and
2344.0 cm1 in the solid state (15 K) [137]. In aqueous solution this band is shifted
by only 6 cm1 from the vapor phase value (down to 2343 cm1), indicating the
absence of hydrogen bonding between water molecules and dissolved CO2
[138]. The infrared absorption produced by the bending vibration of the molecule
is observed at 667.38 cm1 for gaseous CO2 [136]. In a pure CO2-ice, the v2
spectrum at 15 K has two components, peaking at 654.7 and 659.8 cm1 with a
full width at half maximum of 1.8 and 3.1 cm–1, respectively, showing Davidov
splitting caused by a highly ordered ice structure [137]. Because a carbon dioxide
molecule has a center of symmetry, the antisymmetric stretching (v3) and the
bending (v2) modes are Raman inactive. A Fermi dyad is observed in the Raman
spectrum of gaseous CO2 at 1285.40 and 1388.15 cm1 [136], which originates
from the resonance between the unperturbed energy levels associated with the
fundamental
transition
of
the
v1
totally
symmetric
stretching
mode
(v1 ¼ 1333 cm1) and the harmonic transition 2v2 of the v2 bending mode.
Table 1.3 compares the IR fundamental frequencies of gaseous CO2 [136] with
those measured for gaseous CO2
+ [139] and for CO2
 isolated in solid neon
[97, 99].
The IR spectrum of CO2
 in a neon matrix, where the radical anion is free from
interactions with metal cations (Sect. 1.4), exhibits marked differences with respect
to that of the neutral parent molecule. Because of the bent geometry (C2v) of the
anion, all the three normal vibration modes of CO2
 are IR-active. The changes of
the stretching frequencies are pronounced. Their lower values reﬂect a reduced CO
symmetric stretching
bending (doubly degenerate)
antisymmetric stretching

bond order, which is 1.5 in CO2
 as compared with 2 for CO2. It is worth noting that
the interaction of the radical anion with a metal cation can cause signiﬁcant shifts
of the frequency values v1, v2, and v3 with respect to those tabulated above [75,
83–86].
The value observed for the antisymmetric stretching frequency v3 of gaseous
CO2
+ is very close to that measured for the radical cation when the latter was
isolated in solid neon (v3 ¼ 1421.7 cm1) [97, 99]. It has long been recognized that
v3 for CO2
+ is anomalously low [118, 140, 141]. From the analysis of high
resolution spectra of CO2
+, Kawaguchi et al. [140] argued that the origin of the
anomalously low v3 frequency could be explained in terms of a vibronic interaction
between the 2Πg ground state and the 2Πu excited electronic state through the v3
vibration normal mode.
The formation of CO2-adducts, which may involve the population of one of the
LUMOs of CO2, can also originate large modiﬁcations in the IR spectrum of the
CO2 moiety. The antisymmetric stretching mode, va(OCO), is lowered in the range
2250–1400 cm1, the symmetric stretching mode, vs(OCO), becomes IR-active and
can absorb in the region 1400–1100 cm1, the bending mode δ(OCO) is shifted
from 667 cm1, and additional vibrational modes, such as metal-carbon and/or
metal-oxygen stretching modes, and C¼O out-of-plane deformation, may be
observed in the low-frequency region (down to 300 cm1).
The spectroscopic features of these absorptions can provide useful information
on the bonding mode of the heterocumulene in the adduct [142–145] (see Sect. 2.6).
1.6.2
UV Spectrum of Carbon Dioxide
The UV absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide has been widely studied both
experimentally [20, 22, 27, 116, 146] and theoretically [18, 21, 24, 147–150] (see
also Sect. 1.2.2). A huge effort has been lavished on identifying the excited states
involved in the electronic transitions. To this end, electron impact spectroscopy has
proved to be an additional useful diagnostic tool [151–153].
Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet
regions, at least down to 210 nm (hv <5.91 eV), both in the liquid phase [154]
and in the gas phase [117].
Only weak absorptions can be observed below 11 eV. CO2 shows three maxima
in the vacuum ultraviolet region at 147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV), and 112.1 nm
(11.08 eV), respectively. The bands corresponding to the maxima at 147.5 nm and
133.2 nm exhibit a vibrational structure which is poor, irregular, and apparently
complex for the maximum at 147.5 nm, while it is sharper and more regular for that
at 133.2 nm. The assignment of these absorption maxima has been controversial
and a much debated question. Several authors have assigned the maxima at
147.5 nm and 133.2 nm to transitions to 1Δu and 1Πg states, respectively. The
maximum at 112.1 nm exhibits much higher intensity. This is the strongest absorp-
tion band of carbon dioxide. The intensity of the absorption indicates that this
22

transition, identiﬁed as 1Σ u
+  1Σg
+, is optically allowed [148]. Above 11 eV there
are several Rydberg series converging to the various states of CO2
+.
The spectroscopic properties of CO2 in the UV region are of fundamental
importance for understanding the photochemistry of this molecule. In fact, upon
UV irradiation, CO2 can undergo photodissociation into CO and O (1.23) [155–
160]. Studying the reaction (1.23) is of great help in

elucidating the role and chemical behavior of CO2, not only in the Earth’s atmo-
sphere but also in the atmospheres of comets or other planets such as Mars and
Venus [161–165], where any build-up of oxygen is believed to occur only through
this process.
In general, the energy states of O and CO generated by CO2 photodissociation
depend on the wavelength of the absorbed UV light. Table 1.4 summarizes the
energy thresholds for the production of CO and O in their different states by
photodissociation of CO2. The electronically excited oxygen atoms generated
during the photodissociation process, for instance O(1S) and O(1D), may undergo
subsequent quenching to the O(3P) ground state by collisions. Recombination of O
(3P) atoms can afford molecular oxygen, O2, through reaction (1.24), where M is
some third body or, also, the vessel walls.

Slanger and Black [156] revisited the dissociation of CO2 at 147.0 and 130.2–
130.6 nm and ascertained that the quantum yield for oxygen atom production was
unity, thus closing a long-lasting dispute on this matter. Zhu and Gordon [157]
determined, by a chemical scavenging method, the branching ratio between reac-
tions (1.23a) and (1.23b), which was 94 % O(1D) and 6 % O(3P) for hv
corresponding to light at 157 nm.
The production of O(3P) under the conditions used (157 nm) has been a matter of
further studies [158, 159] and requires a comment about the mechanism of forma-
tion. In fact, the 157-nm (7.91 eV) excitation is to the dissociative continuum of the
lowest 1B2 state (Sect. 1.2.1), corresponding to the dissociation products CO(1Σ)
and O(1D) (7.42 eV) (Fig. 1.7). Moreover, the photodissociation of CO2 to CO(1Σ)
+ O(3P) violates the spin conservation rule, as the spin of CO2 in the ground state
(1Σg
+) is zero whereas the total spin of CO(1Σ) + O(3P) is unity, and, therefore,
reaction (1.23a) is a spin-forbidden process.
The mechanism proposed to explain the production of O(3P) implies a transition
from the surface of the 1B2 state to the surface of the lower 3B2 state. Figure 1.7
shows that the two states intersect approximately 0.27 eV above the CO(1Σ) + O(3P)

asymptote. In principle, the efﬁciency of this singlet–triplet transition depends on
the lifetime of the excited state. According to Zhu and Gordon [157], although the
molecule contains energy excess (11 kcal/mol; 0.48 eV) over the CO(1Σ) + O(1D)
dissociation threshold, it does not dissociate readily because the bent upper state
(1B2) makes it difﬁcult to concentrate enough energy along the reaction coordinate.
This increases the lifetime of the excited state and the probability of curve crossing
to the triplet state. This mechanism has been recently criticized by Cossart-Magos
et al. [27], who have proposed the 3A2 state (Sect. 1.2.2), instead of the 3B2, as the
CO2 triplet state involved in the photodissociation process.
A new phenomenon has been observed by Bhattacharya et al. [160] who studied
the formation of O2 and CO produced by CO2 photolysis at 185  2 nm (6.7 eV;
Hg lamp). Under the above conditions the only energetically possible primary
process is the production of O(3P) ((1.23a); see also Table 1.4). They focused on
oxygen and carbon isotope fractionation associated with the products, which was
compared to the estimate based on a kinetic model. Both CO and O2 were enriched
in 17O by about 81 %, but not in 18O. Moreover, CO was enriched in 13C by about
37 % with respect to the model composition.
Figure 1.8 helps to explain the generally accepted mechanism for CO2 dissoci-
ation by 6–7 eV energy photons. It implies an electronic transition of the CO2
molecule from the singlet ground state (1Σg
+) to the upper (bound) singlet state 1B2.
In this state, CO2 cannot dissociate, as this transition takes the molecule into a

vibrational level which is below the asymptote of the state 1B2 but above the
crossover zone with the state 3B2. Dissociation can occur if the molecule can
reach the crossover region (by collisions, for instance) and undergo a transition to
the triplet state 3B2.
As already emphasized, the latter transition is spin forbidden, but can take place
in the presence of a suitable perturbation, such as spin-orbit coupling involving the
valence electrons. Because this perturbation is of same magnitude for the different
isotopes, it cannot explain, per se, the anomalous 13C and 17O isotopic enrichment
observed in CO and O2 products. Therefore, it has been proposed that the nuclear
spin of 13C (I ¼ 1/2) and 17O (I ¼ 5/2) may introduce additional coupling by
hyperﬁne interaction, which may increase the dissociation rate of the isotopologues
containing 13C and 17O. Interestingly, the 17O enrichment is 2.2  0.2 times higher
than that of 13C, a value very close to the value of 2.7, which gives the μ(13C)/μ
(17O) magnetic moment ratio for the two nuclei.
The inﬂuence of nuclear spin in photodissociation of molecules is a novel effect
which may have important implications and potential applications in the study of
terrestrial and planetary atmospheres [160].
1.6.3
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent, such as benzene or toluene, exhibits only one
13C resonance around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions the resonance is close to
125 ppm [166] and can be used for the quantiﬁcation of free CO2.
13C-NMR has proved to be a very useful spectroscopic technique for identifying
the COO moiety when the carbon dioxide molecule, as a whole, is incorporated into
a new compound. The 13C resonance of CO2 shifts downﬁeld upon ﬁxation of the
heterocumulene into organic products, such as carbamic acids or carbamates (150–
160 ppm), carbonates (145–165 ppm), acids (160–180 ppm), esters (160–170 ppm),
or their metallorganic analogues (metal carbamates LnM(O2CNR2), metal
carbonates LnM(O2COR), metallacarboxylates LnM(O2CR), metallacarboxylic
acids LnM(CO2H), and metallaesters LnM(CO2R).
The above remarks emphasize the usefulness of NMR spectroscopy in demon-
strating the formation of a CO2-complex: these aspects are discussed in Sect. 2.6.
As noted in Sect. 1.6.1, IR spectroscopy may also be of great help in this context
and several CO2 complexes have been characterized adequately by the combined
use of both the spectroscopic techniques. This is particularly useful in those cases
wherein X-ray characterization is not possible.
Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy has been used to study the ﬂuxional
behavior of CO2 adducts in solution (see Sect. 2.7).

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes
of Bonding and Reactivity
Abstract The modes of coordination of carbon dioxide (CO2) to metal centres are
presented in this chapter. The coordination at both room temperature and low
temperature in gas matrices is discussed with the reactivity of the coordinated
cumulene. X-ray diffraction structural data are presented and discussed together
with spectroscopic properties of the complexes.
2.1
Mode of Bonding of Carbon Dioxide
to Transition-Metal Centres
The Walsh diagram (Fig. 2.1), already discussed in Chap. 1 and recalled here for the
reader’s beneﬁt, suggests that carbon dioxide (CO2) can in principle act as an
acceptor of electrons (through the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital [LUMO]
centred at the C atom) and a donor, through the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) centred at the O atoms.
However, electrons and electron-rich species (nucleophiles such as metals in a
low oxidation state, bases, hydride ions, etc.) most likely interact with CO2 by
binding to the C atom, whereas electron-poor centres (electrophiles such as the
proton, metal centres in high oxidation state, electron deﬁcient molecules, etc.)
attack one of the O atoms. The modes of bonding with a single metal centre of
different natures and properties are schematized in Scheme 2.1.

The Walsh diagram also shows that if electron density is transferred to the
LUMO, the cumulene molecule minimizes the energy by bending and the optimi-
zation of the energy state is reached with an OCO angle around 125–133.
Conversely, if electron density is transferred from the O atoms to an acceptor, the
cumulene may still maintain a quasilinear geometry. Such a forecast is demon-
strated by experimental data (X-ray diffraction [XRD] structure of solid complexes)
being correct, as discussed in the next paragraphs. Unfortunately, not all isolated
complexes afforded good monocrystals for XRD structure determination. In unfor-
tunate cases, if the XRD structure was unavailable, spectroscopic studies were used
for getting information about the solid-state structure and the mode of bonding of
the cumulene. Good information was obtained using isotope-labelled CO2 (13C,
17O, 18O) in infrared (IR) or even nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) multinuclear
studies. Although not so accurate as XRD, valuable information was collected with
Fourier transform IR (FTIR) studies, which were able to connect the different
coordination modes of bonded CO2.
Theoretical calculations have more recently been used to collect information
about bonding, as discussed below. The coordination of CO2 to metal centres is
presented in the next sections, following the history of discovery of the different
classes of bonding modes.

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
2.2
XRD Structure of η2-C,O Mononuclear Metal
Complexes
The ﬁrst transition metal complex to be structurally characterized was (PCy3)2Ni
(CO2) (1) described by Aresta et al. [3] (Structure 2.1). The Ni atom shows a planar
geometry, and coordinated CO2 has two non-equivalent CO bonds (1.17 and
1.22 Å, to be compared with 1.16 of the free molecule) and an OCO angle of
133, with a strong deviation from D1h symmetry.
The Ni–C and Ni–O1 bond distances are 1.84 and 1.99 Å, respectively, showing
that both C and one of the O atoms are within bonding distance from the Ni atom.
The strong difference of the four ligands causes an irregular angle distribution at the
Ni centre.
The deviation of the coordinated CO2 molecule from linearity is well in accor-
dance with the forecast done in Sect. 2.1 following the features of the Walsh
diagram. Coordinated CO2 has some features of CO2
. but is not identical to
it. This point is relevant to the deﬁnition of the oxidation state of Ni. Because
CO2 is a neutral ligand and 1 can be made by substituting PCy3 in Ni(PCy3)3, in
which Ni has a “zero” oxidation state, the question is whether the oxidation state of
Ni in 1 is still zero or +1 if CO2 resembles CO2
., or +2 if Ni–O and Ni–C bonds are
considered?
Most likely, no one of the three limit states in Scheme 2.2a–c represents the real
situation.
A recent DFT study [5] described the electronic structure of (PH3)2Ni(CO2) (2),
which is analogous to 1 but not identical because of the different nature and size of
the phosphane ligands, which may vary both the electron donor–acceptor properties
and the steric hindrance. As a matter of fact, the calculated OCO angle is 144,
much different from that in 1, and the C–O bond lengths are 1.204 (C¼O) and
1.256 A, also quite different from 1. It has been suggested that in 2 the C–O

σ-bond may take part in electron donation to the metal, and that the P atom of the
phosphane adjacent to the C¼O moiety of CO2 may transfer electron density to the
C atom.
An
example
of
bis(CO2)-η2
complex,
namely,
trans-Mo(CO2)2HN
(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3), was reported by Carmona et al. [5]. The complex has a
distorted octahedral geometry with two staggered CO2 ligands η2-C,O-coordinated
to molybdenum. The CO2 ligands show C–O lengths ranging from 1.199 to 1.284 Å
and OCO angles of 131. The Mo–C distance (2.08 Å), as well as the distances
between the molybdenum atom and the CO2 oxygen atoms bound to the metal
(2.111(6) and 2.138(6) Å), demonstrate strong binding of the coordinated C–O
moieties to the metal center.

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
It must be emphasized that the η2-C,O coordination represents by far the most
popular mode of bonding of CO2 and several metal complexes having such struc-
ture [7–10] have been isolated and structurally characterized.
The O,C-interaction is also found in other metal systems which are considered as
primary η1-C coordination to a metal centre stabilized by an external O–E interac-
tion (where E is a different centre from that which binds the C atom of the
cumulene).
The ﬁrst structurally characterized complex of this type was Co(n-Pr-salen)
(CO2)K(THF) (salen ¼ N,N0-ethylenebis(salicylideneaminato)), studied by Floriani
et al. [11]. The crystals of this compound were dimorphous. The structural data,
obtained for both crystalline forms (A and B), showed that the CO2 ligand is
markedly bent (OCO angle: 134.9(26) for the A form, 132.0(15) for the B
form), with C–O bond lengths ranging from 1.20 to 1.24 Å. The CO2 ligand is
bound to cobalt through carbon (Co–C bond length: 1.99–2.00 Å), and to potassium
ions through the oxygen atoms (K–O bond lengths: from 2.66 to 2.74 Å). One of the
oxygen atoms of the CO2 ligand is also bound to a second potassium ion (2.60–
2.68 Å). The K+---O interactions play a crucial role in the formation and stabiliza-
tion of the Co–CO2 adduct, as also documented by the behaviour of the strictly
related compounds Co(salen)CO2M (M ¼ Li, Na, K). It was observed that the
nature of the alkali metal exerts some control over the reversibility of CO2 binding
in Co(salen)CO2M salts: the sodium and potassium salts lose CO2 under vacuum,
unlike the lithium salt which does not. Moreover, Co(salen)CO2Na loses CO2
partially upon addition of a sodium-complexing agent such as dicyclohexano-18-
crown-6 (DCHC) and Co(salen)Na(THF) reacted only to a limited extent with CO2
in a THF solution containing the crown-ether, where the complex [Co(salen)
Na]2(DCHC) is formed.

spectra of prim,rac-CoL(CO2)+, measured over the range 298–198 K in CD3CN
and in a CD3CN/THF mixture, indicated the existence, in solution, of four CO2
adducts (Scheme 2.3), two of which, respectively penta-(B) and hexa-coordinated
(D), showed intramolecular hydrogen bonds between bound CO2 and the amine
hydrogens of the macrocyclic ligand.
An analogous ediﬁce of interactions could also stabilize the putative adduct
represented in Structure 2.2, which has been proposed as the key intermediate in the
highly selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO by Ni(cyclam)Cl2
(cyclam ¼ 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) in a purely aqueous medium [13, 14].
Sauvage et al. [13, 14] suggested that the high selectivity of Ni(cyclam)Cl2 for
electroreduction of CO2 to CO over that of H2O to H2, in the presence of water as
solvent, was related to the size of the macrocyclic ligand and to the presence of NH
groups,

as shown in Structure 2.2. Accordingly, the replacement of cyclam with 1,4,8,11-
tetraazacyclotetra deca-1,4,8,11-tetraene or tetramethylated-cyclam (1,4,8,11-
tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclo tetradecane), which are unable to establish an
analogous interaction, caused a marked decrease of CO/H2 selectivity.

Many simple reactions of carbon dioxide require the presence of acid–base
systems (bifunctional systems). Recently, CO2 was found to react easily with
frustrated Lewis pairs [15, 16]. For instance, the components of the couple

and
the

(C6H2Me3)2PCH2CH2B(C6F5)2 [16, 17]. Other important examples of bifunctional
activation of carbon dioxide are provided by carboxylation of sodium phenoxide,
the key step of Kolbe–Schmitt synthesis of salicylic acid, [18, 19], carboxylation of
Grignard reagents [20], and carbonic anhydrase promoted hydration of carbon
dioxide [21]. It is now recognized that this enzymatic process implies the nucleo-
philic attack of a Zn2+-bound hydroxyl group on free CO2, which is held in place by
hydrogen bonds within the pocket of the active site of the enzyme. The insertion
reactions of CO2 into M–E (E ¼ H, C, N, O, etc.) (see Chap. 4) bonds provide other
interesting examples of such bifunctional activation. The latter reactions may be
relevant to catalytic processes implying CO2 ﬁxation into organic products with the
generation of a new E–C bond. These reactions do not necessarily require the
coordination of the heterocumulene to a metal centre as observed in isolated
complexes. More often, they are initiated by nucleophilic attack of E at the
electrophilic carbon of CO2 and assisted by weak interactions between the metal
centre and the lone pairs of one of the oxygen atoms of CO2.
2.3
XRD Structural Data for η1-C Metal Complexes
η1-C transition metal complexes are much rarer than the η2-C,O described above.
The reaction of Rh(diars)2Cl (diars ¼ o-phenylene-bis(dimethyl)arsine) with
slightly pressurized CO2 in CH3CN affords Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) 3, an example of
the behaviour of CO2 acting as an only-C-electrophile [22]. XRD of the isolated
solid shows that, upon bonding to CO2, the Rh-As framework remains almost
unchanged. The coordination around Rh is essentially octahedral and CO2 sits
trans to chlorine and acts as a monodentate ligand, interacting with the nucleophilic
metal centre through the central carbon (η1-C coordination). In such an adduct, the
C–O bond distances, 1.20(2) and 1.25(2) Å, respectively, are both elongated,
although asymmetrically, with respect to the free ligand, while the OCO angle is
126 (Structure 2.3). Whether such asymmetric CO2 structure is stabilized by a
“non conventional” weak intramolecular C–OH–C bonding, involving one of the
methyl groups of the arsane ligand, or not has been a matter of discussion, but such
interaction seems to be excluded by XRD.
η1-C coordination has also been claimed in a few other Rh and Ir complexes [23–
25], albeit only on the basis of spectroscopic (IR) studies.
Ir(CO2)(Cl)(dmpe)2 (dmpe ¼ bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane), isostructural with
3, reacts with FSO3Me to afford the methoxycarbonyl–Ir complex Ir(CO2CH3)(Cl)
(dmpe)2 [24]. Such reactivity provides evidence that the oxygen atoms of CO2 η1-
C-coordinated to a metal center are characterized by a signiﬁcant nucleophilic
character and can interact with electrophiles.
2.3
XRD Structural Data for η1-C Metal Complexes
41
The iron complex (PMe3)4Fe(CO2) 4 described by Karsch in 1977 [26] is an
example of how the metal centre and the ligands may inﬂuence the coordination of
CO2. 4 shows a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with CO2 lying in the equatorial
plane, with two relatively long asymmetric C–O bonds (1.25 and 1.28 Å) and a
small OCO angle of 124, smaller than that of the CO2
 moiety. The structural data
demonstrate an analogy of the nature of CO2 in 4 and 3, implying both C–O bonds
are much elongated with respect to the free cumulene and the OCO angle close to
125, smaller than that in the radical anion CO2
.
The η1-C mode of bonding has been demonstrated to exist in an Ru complex
described by Tanaka [27].
A comment is needed about the relative stability of η1-C with respect to η2-C,O
complexes. In general, the latter are more stable than the former, which more easily
lose CO2 and can be considered as reversible carriers of the cumulene. The solvent
can play a key role in the stabilization of the “M–CO2” moiety which can be
isolated if CO2 is not strongly “solvated”. The donor properties of the metal also
determine the stability of the M–C bond and the η1-C complex can often be
stabilized by the interaction of the O atom with an external electrophile, as
discussed in Sect. 2.2 for the Co–salen complexes.
A comparison is required at this point of such η1-C metal–CO2 complexes with
the adduct of CO2 with the ionic-liquid 1,3-dimethylimidazolium moiety [28]. The
latter, upon reaction with dimethylcarbonate, affords 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-
carboxylate. In the latter, the generated imidazolium C-carbene binds CO2 at C by
using the free couple of electrons. The C–COO bond length is 1.523(3) Å
corresponding to a single C–C bond (two electrons bond) without delocalization
from the ring. The two C–O bond lengths are equivalent (1.2398 Å) implying a
single charge localized on each oxygen. This causes strong OH bonding with
pairing of two units in the solid state. The resulting C ! CO2 moiety is formally
similar to the M ! CO2 discussed above: in the solid adduct 1,3-dimethylimi-
dazolium-2-carboxylate, the carboxylate moiety is stabilized through the interac-
tion of the nucleophilic O atoms with the imidazolium-ring hydrogens.

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
2.4
XRD Structural Characterization of O-End-On
Complexes
The ﬁrst evidence of a linear η1-O-coordinated CO2 was reported in 2004 [29] by
Castro-Rodriguez et al. who described the reaction of CO2 with (AdArO)3tacnUIII
((AdArO)3tacn ¼ 1,4,7-tris(adamantyl-5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)1,4,7-triazacy-
clononane). The sterically hindered ligands prevented the η2-C,O bonding. The
product obtained was the complex (AdArO)3tacnU(η1-OCO) 5 in which the end-on
CO2 is η1-O coordinated to uranium [30]. XRD of the solid has shown that the OCO
angle is close to linear (178), the U–O bond length is 2.351 Å, with a short bond
and a longer terminal C–O bond: the terminal C–O bond length is 1.277(4) Å, which
is longer than the internal C–O bond distance (1.122(4) Å).
The bonding model foresees an oxidized original U(III) to U(IV) with resonance
structures represented by UIV¼O¼C–O $ UIV–OC–O which justify the short
and long C–O bonds. Magnetic moment (μeff) measurements have clearly
established that UIII was oxidized to UIV with the transfer of virtually one electron
to CO2. This transfer does not bring the electron in the empty LUMO centred on C
and, therefore, the molecule is not bent as in η1-C or η2-C,O complexes.
2.5
Multinuclear Complexes
The coordination of CO2 to more than one metal centre is possible. It has been
clearly demonstrated through the XRD structure of isolated systems. Complexes
bearing the CO2 molecule coordinated to more than one metal centre in a μ-η2, μ-η3,
μ-η4 and μ-η5 mode have been reported, and the geometries of bonding are shown in
Scheme 2.5. Such complexes are in general quite stable.
2.5.1
Side-On Bonded Complexes
An interesting example of a μ-η4 complex in which both C¼O bonds of a single
cumulene molecule are bonded to a metal centre was reported by Sadighi et al. in
2007 [31]. The μ-η2, η2-CO2 coordination has been demonstrated to exist in a
dinickel complex having the core [(IPr)Ni]2(μ-CO)(μ-η2,η2-CO2) 6, where IPr is
1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene. The CO originates from CO2
and the two CO2 ligands bridge two nickel atoms via two Ni–CO bonds in a side-
on way (Structure 2.4).
The bridged CO2 is bent at 133.4 and the CO bond lengths are 1.255 and
1.257 Å, much longer than for free CO2 (1.16 Å) but comparable to the length found
in similar side-on complexes. Similar Ni–biscarbene complexes, (IMe)2Ni(0), form
analogous complexes (IMe ¼ 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene).
2.5
Multinuclear Complexes
43
DFT studies have been carried out to demonstrate the bonding of CO2 to Metal
Organic Frameworks (MOF). A bridged coordination has been proposed by Hou
et al. [22] in the interaction of CO2 with M-MOF-74 (M ¼ Mg and Zn), which
shows a high CO2 adsorption capacity. Metal ions are supposed to interact with the
O atoms of CO2, whereas the carbon atom of CO2 gives strong interactions with the
O atoms of the organic linkers of the MOF.

which is believed to form a bridged Al–Mg intermediate with AlR3; this subse-
quently loses a ligand from the magnesium centre and is attacked by a second
molecule of carbon dioxide through the oxygen atom as a weak electron donor.
Finally, carbon dioxide acts as a bridging ligand to form a trimer.
The structure was conﬁrmed by X-ray diffraction as having a C3-symmetry axis,
and three almost linear carbon dioxide bridges which form a 12-membered ring.
The OCO angles are in the range 169.6–175.3, quite close to 180 and larger than
the angles found in the η1- or η2-complexes. The C–O bond lengths are in the range
1.149–1.233 Å, with a longer and a shorter bond with respect to the free molecule,
whose values are reminiscent of the U-complex reported above.
The Mg–O bond lengths (1.944(10)–2.232(12) Å for 7 and 2.004(16)–2.184
(11) Å for 8) are within the range expected for Mg–O (monodentate donor ligand)
bonds (2.012–2.236 Å), suggesting that each oxygen atom donates a lone pair of
electrons to the vacant p-orbital of magnesium in a dative bond. The vibrational
spectra showed that, in both molecules 7 (R ¼ Me) and 8 (R ¼ Et), only a small
amount of electron density was transferred from coordinated CO2 to the more
electropositive Mg atoms.
Polyoxometalate anions such as (H2PMo11CoO40)5 were shown to be able to
interact with CO2 affording stable adducts of (PMo11CoO38)n polymeric chains
bridged by CO2 in an axial direction. In the CO2 adduct (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)
[PMo11CoO38(CO2)].4H2O, single crystal X-ray diffraction showed that CO2 is
(μ-η1,η1)-coordinated [33]. The CO2 moieties show slightly bent arrangements with
OCO angles of 158.7 and C–O bond lengths of 1.287 Å. The two O atoms of the
CO2 link MoVI and CoII from two neighbouring polyoxoanions, respectively. The
coordinative bond of the two O atoms from CO2 with the electropositive MoVI and
CoII ions reduces the electron density of the end O atoms, resulting in the increased
OCO bond lengths. Similar results were also obtained for the strictly related
compound (C3H5N2)4(SiMo11CoO38(CO2)).4H2O. Such behaviour is of great inter-
est as it opens the way to the use of polyoxometalates as CO2 sequestering agents in
aqueous medium.
X-ray diffraction [34] on the adduct of CO2 with the MOF Ni2(dhtp), where dhtp
is 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, has shown that CO2 is bound to Ni(II) in a η1-O-
end-on fashion and is slightly bent.
From the above data it is possible to conclude that CO2 can act as an electron
acceptor or an electron donor, or the two features can be present in the same adduct.
Low oxidation state metals and electron-rich moieties interact with the C atom,
whereas electron-poor species (metal ions, protons) interact at the O terminal. As a
consequence of such ability, CO2 can give rise to divers bonds with metal centres
depending on the nature of the latter.

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
2.6
Spectroscopic (IR and 13C-NMR) Data
for the Complexes Correlated to the Various Modes
of Bonding of CO2
Spectroscopic data of CO2 metal complexes have been obtained and an attempt has
been made to use them as an auxiliary technique for structure work-out in case XRD
characterization of metal complexes was not available. Two spectroscopic tech-
niques have mostly been used to this end, namely Infrared (IR, or FTIR, or DRIFT)
and 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C-NMR), the former being most informa-
tive. Theoretical calculations have also been coupled with spectroscopic studies to
get a better insight into the structural properties of the CO2 complexes. Good
quality information can be gathered by carrying out a detailed analysis of multiple
data, although individual pieces of information may be quite deceptive.
2.6.1
Infrared Data Relevant to Transition Metal Complexes
Two IR modes have a relevance to the bonding mode of CO2 to a metal centre and
are tentatively used for roughly ﬁguring out the interaction of CO2 with a metal
centre: the v(C¼Ο) and the δ(C¼O).
It is now clear that the structural features of the metal complexes reﬂect on the
position of the IR-bands characteristic of cumulene and a deviation from the
original values is found; conversely, it is quite unlikely that the IR-features may
be informative about the structure of the bonded CO2. The infrared properties of
CO2 are summarized in Table 2.1, which collects data relevant to a number of TM
complexes.
As a general principle, as discussed above, any time an interaction occurs at the
C atom the molecule deviates from its linearity, being bent from 180 to ca. 130
with a consequent low-energy deplacement of v(C¼Ο) from 2 340 cm1 to
ca. 1 750–1 650 cm1. When the interaction occurs at the oxygen atom without
direct involvement of the C atom, the cumulene molecule almost maintains its
linear geometry and the lowering of the energy of the above band is much lower
(shift to ca. 2 200 cm1). The assignment of the bands is more precisely done and
more information is gained if isotopic labelling is used, with 13C- and 18O-labelled
CO2. IR data, coupled to variable temperature NMR (VT-13C-NMR, see
Sect. 2.6.2) have been used to determine whether the coordinated side-on (O,C)
cumulene is a rigid moiety or is ﬂuxional (Sect. 2.7).
The use of isotopic labelled CO2 has served to interpret correctly the interme-
diate steps in the geometry modiﬁcation in solution [35].
Jegat et al. [36] have used labelled CO2 to discover a general relationship that
may better correlate FTIR data to the structure of TM–CO2 complexes. They have
based their conclusion on the value of ΣΔv that represents the sum of the frequency-

shifts observed for the two ν(CO) in 13C and 18O complexes. The relationships they
have elaborated can be expressed as categorized below:

Such a criterion requires use of expensive double-labelled CO2 and a quite detailed
analysis of the IR spectrum. Additional observations are reported by the same

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
authors which may help in inferring the structure of TM–CO2 complexes in the
absence of XRD data. For example, in η1-C-coordinated complexes, the frequency
splitting between the two v(CO) stretching modes is observed to be less than 400 cm1.
O-end-on complexes show quite unique IR properties. The UIV f2 ion [29]
exhibits a v(CO) band at 2 188 cm1, shifted by 60 cm1 using 13CO2 and the
out-of-plane bending mode γ(C¼O), located in the 500–650 cm1 region, exhibits
preponderant 18O effect, in contrast to other coordination modes, for which a larger
13C effect is observed (namely Δγ(13C) ¼ 10–20 cm1, vs Δγ(18O) ¼ 5 cm1).
Other IR data relevant to O-bonded complexes are: (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)
(PMo11CoO38(CO2)).4H2O: 2 169 cm1,
13CO2 red-shift: 61 cm1; {R2Al
(μ-NSiMe3)(μ-OSiMe3)Mg(THF)2(μ-O2C)}3: 2 267 (R ¼ Me) and 2 275 cm1
(R ¼ Et), 13CO2 red-shift: 73 and 65 cm1, respectively. In the above CO2 com-
plexes the shift of va(OCO) absorption relative to v3 of free CO2 is modest if
compared with that observed when the heterocumulene is η1-C or side-on (η2-C,
O) coordinated to a metal center. For instance, Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) [23] shows
absorptions assigned to η1-C-coordinated CO2 at 1 660 (s) and 1 210 (s) cm1,
whereas Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2 [3] exhibits intense bands because of side-on coordination
of the heterocumulene at 1 740 (vs) and 1 150 (s) cm1.
It is interesting to note that in η1-C-coordinated CO2 complexes the frequency
splitting between the two v(OCO) stretching modes is often less than 400 cm1,
and, in end-on (η1-OCO) complexes, the out-of-plane bending mode γ(C¼O),
absorbing in the 650–500 cm1 range, shows a pronounced 18O effect, different
from the other coordination modes, where a larger
13C effect is observed
(Δγ(13C) ¼ 10–20 cm1 vs Δγ(18O) ¼ 5 cm1) [35, 36].
The IR spectra of the O-end-on complexes Mg  O ¼ C ¼ O ! Mg [32] exhibit
strong absorptions at 2 267 and 2 275 cm1, slightly red-shifted by 73 and 65 cm1
relative to free CO2, whereas side-on complexes usually exhibit shifts greater than
300 cm1.
The adduct of CO2 with (H2PMo11CoO40)5 [33] shows in the IR spectrum an
absorption band at 2 169 cm1, shifted to 2 108 cm1 upon 13C labelling.
An extensive analysis of IR spectra of CO2-TM complexes can be found in [8, 9].
2.6.2
NMR Data for Transition Metal Complexes
As anticipated in Sect. 1.6.3, 13C NMR spectra (or else 17O-spectra) can contribute
to structure investigation in solution and to gathering information about the behav-
iour of the CO2-TM complexes in the liquid phase. The multiplicity of peaks when
P-ligands are present on active metal nuclei can help one to understand the nature of
bonding. The shift from free CO2 (124 ppm) may be an indication of how the C¼O
is affected by coordination to a metal. So, for example, O-end-on complexes show
13C-resonance slightly up-ﬁeld shifted (around ca. 121–110 ppm) with respect to
the free cumulene, whereas side-on complexes usually show 13C resonances down-

ﬁeld shifted around 200 ppm. The shift is obviously correlated to the transfer of
electron density to/from the coordinated CO2 and to the molecular geometry.
Table 2.2 reports a selection of data which can be helpful in illustrating the
relation structure-NMR properties of the CO2-TM complexes.
Coordination of the heterocumulene to a metal center induces the shift of the 13C
resonance of coordinated CO2. A modest up-ﬁeld shift has been measured for
end-on complexes, such as {R2Al(μ-NSiMe3)(μ-OSiMe3)Mg(THF)2(μ-O2C)}3
(120.87 ppm, R ¼ Me; 120.76 ppm, R ¼ Et) [32], or (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)
(PMo11CoO38(CO2)).4H2O (113.86 ppm) and (C3H5N2)4(SiMo11CoO38(CO2)).4H2O
(112.50 ppm) [33].
However, other known coordination modes, such as the side-on mode and the
variety of bridging modes [8], shift to low ﬁelds the 13C resonance of the CO2
ligand relative to the value found for free CO2.
Values in the range 150–270 ppm have been reported for different CO2 com-
plexes, and the chemical shift of coordinated CO2 may differ widely even in
complexes showing the same coordination mode.
Thus, in the side-on complexes Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 (159.28 ppm, at 298 K) and
Pd(η2-CO2)(PMePh2)2 (166.2 ppm) coordinated CO2 resonates at higher ﬁelds than
in the metallocene derivatives (Cp*)2Nb(η2-CO2)(CH2SiMe3) (200.5 ppm) and

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
Cp2Ti(η2-CO2)(PMe3) (212.3 ppm) or a few bis-(η2-CO2) complexes of molybde-
num (201–217 ppm) [5]. It is unclear whether these differences in the chemical shift
of side-on coordinated CO2 are because of the difference in the coordination
geometry of the various adducts or are related to the different nature of coordinating
metal center.
Very high values of chemical shift have been found in a few complexes wherein
CO2 bridges two or more metal centers. For instance, in the bridged complexes [(η5-
Cp)(CO)2Fe¼CO2W(η5-Cp)2]PF6
and
[(η5-Cp*)(CO)2Ru¼CO2W(η5-Cp)2]BF4
the coordinated CO2 molecules resonate at 259.5 and 251.5 ppm, respectively, in
agreement with their alternative formulation as dimetallated dioxocarbene
ligands [38].
The coupling constant of the 13C nucleus of coordinated CO2 with the nuclei of
the metal center or other ligands is a useful spectral parameter which may help to
distinguish a CO2-adduct from a metal–carbonate complex. For instance, the CO2
ligand in Ni(dcpp)(η2-CO2) absorbs at 164.2 ppm, very close to 166.2 ppm, which
is the resonance of carbonate ligand in Ni(dcpe)(CO3). However, the carbonate
ligand in Ni(dcpe)(CO3) resonates as singlet, whereas coordinated CO2 in Ni(dcpp)
(η2-CO2) gives a doublet with a 2J(C–Ptrans) equal to 45 Hz [39].
2.7
Fluxionality of the CO2 Molecule Coordinated
to Transition Metal Systems
VT-multinuclear NMR studies have allowed one to establish unequivocally
whether the M-coordinated-CO2 framework is a rigid structure or not. To this
end, it is necessary that other nuclei (such as the P-donor atoms of phosphanes)
are bonded to the metal centre so that, when the metal favours the coupling, it is
possible to observe whether the solid state structure is maintained in solution or the
framework exhibits some ﬂuxionality. Complex 1 has been extensively investigated
and the ﬂuxional behaviour has been well explained by coupling IR and NMR
studies [6, 40].
The dynamics of Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 in solution has been investigated by
Aresta’s group [6]. Both in the solid state and in solution, at temperatures below
200 K, Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 presents identical structures, as ascertained by CP-
MAS-NMR and VT-NMR experiments. The CP-MAS 31P-NMR spectrum of
solid Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 showed two main peaks at 48.9 and 20.9 ppm, respec-
tively, as expected for a planar arrangement of ligands around the Ni atom.
Moreover, the CP-MAS 13C-NMR spectrum of a 13CO2-enriched solid sample of
Ni(η2-13CO2)(PCy3)2 exhibited the peak of CO2 ligand at 159.28 ppm. In solution,
below 200 K, two distinct signals were found in the 31P spectrum for the phosphane
ligands (51.7 and 20.9 ppm; J(P–P) ¼ 39.6 Hz), showing that, at these temperatures,
CO2 is rigidly anchored at the planar nickel center in the (η2-C,O)-coordination
mode (Fig. 2.2). In accordance with the above ﬁndings, in the low-temperature

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity
limiting 13C spectrum (173 K) of Ni(η2-13CO2)(PCy3)2 the resonance of the CO2
ligand appeared as a doublet of doublets at 159.88 ppm with J(C–Ptrans) and J(C–
Pcis) of 41 and 10 Hz, respectively (Fig 2.3).
Upon increasing the temperature above 233 K, the two 31P signals coalesced into
a singlet, showing that the phosphane ligands became equivalent. ΔG{ for the
exchange process was calculated to be 39.3 kJ/mol (9.4 kcal/mol). In the fast-
exchange regime, at 253 K, a triplet at 158.12 ppm was found for the coordinated
CO2, with an averaged value of J(P–C) equal to 14.1 Hz.
The persistence of P–C coupling, even in the fast-exchange regime, ruled out the
hypothesis that equilibration of PCy3 ligands might involve a fast CO2
decordination-recoordination mechanism. Averaging of the phosphane ligands
31P resonances must involve an intramolecular process. The following mechanisms
can be envisaged (Scheme 2.7):
•
Fast rotation around the Ni η2-CO bond (i)
•
Equilibration as a result of the formation of an η1-C intermediate (ii)
•
Equilibration through the formation of an η1-O intermediate (iii)
The available NMR data did not allow differentiating between mechanisms (i)–
(iii) in Scheme 2.3. However, additional FT-IR studies and CAS-SCF calculations

of Ni(CO2)L2 isomers showed that formation of the end-on coordinated intermedi-
ate (mechanism (iii)) may reasonably account for the ﬂuxional behavior Ni(η2-
CO2)(PCy3)2 [6, 40].
Another interesting example of ﬂuxionality has been provided by Carmona’s
group [41]. They studied the dynamic behavior of trans-L4Mo(η2-CO2)2 adducts,
showing that it consists of a synchronous motion of the two CO2 ligands in which
both molecules rotate in the same direction (Structure 2.6).
The above data emphasize the usefulness of NMR spectroscopy in demonstrat-
ing the state of a CO2 complex in solution and comparing the solution state with the
solid state. The solution mode of being of a TM–CO2 complex may be relevant to its
reactivity with several agents.

CO2 Coordination to Metal Centres: Modes of Bonding and Reactivity

Interaction of CO2 with Metal Atoms
in Low-Temperature Solid-Inert-Gas Matrices
Matrix isolation is a technique utilized to immobilize a “reactive species”, such as
naked metal atoms, at very low temperature (a few K) in an inert matrix such as a
noble gas [42]. Atoms can be thermally produced and the combination of the matrix
“cage effect” and low temperature makes that dynamic processes almost hindered.
As mentioned above, the temperature of a few K, often below 10 K, makes the
thermal factor kT as low as <0.083 kJ mol1, preventing most reactions from
occurring. Under such conditions weakly bonded adducts can be frozen and studied.
By raising the temperature by a few K it is possible to observe reactions. The most
used techniques for generating atoms are vapour deposition and laser ablation. The
latter should not produce atoms with excess kinetic energy which might overpass
energy barriers and prevent the observation of adducts and reaction intermediates.
Photochemical effects must be controlled, as they may occur, promoted by the light
emitted during the ablation process.
Infrared spectroscopy is the key technique for the characterization of adducts
and is often coupled to theoretical calculations (mainly DFT) for a good standard
identiﬁcation of adducts. The classes of adducts which have been investigated can
be separated into two, namely (1) the adducts with Group 1, 2, 13 elements and
(2) the adducts with TM atoms.
Group 1 metals form MCO2 complexes (IR around 1 600 cm1) having various
structures (C2v, Cs), and may lead to the formation of oxalate-like species MC2O4
by concentration effects or annealing. The latter may decompose into carbonates
M2CO3 and CO above 200 K [43–46]. The decreasing order of reactivity of alkaline
metals with CO2 is Li > Cs > K > Na, the latter being active in neat CO2-matrices.
Group 2 metals Be [47], Mg [48–50] and Ca [51] have been studied, both
experimentally
and/or
theoretically
and
shown
to
promote
the
reaction
M + CO2 ! MO + CO, endothermic by 26, 66 and 35 kcal mol1 for Be, Mg,
and Ca atoms, respectively. The reaction steps through the cyclic (η2-O,O)-
MOCO structures having barriers of 23, 20 and 14 kcal mol1, respectively.
Thermal Mg atoms [48] led to the formation of the MgOCO C2v cyclic structure
(calculated OCO angle of 128) and IR bands located at 1 580, 1 385 and
866 cm1 with only a small number of Mg atoms being active (even in pure
CO2). The product of condensation of Mg atoms with a CO2/C2H4/Ar mixture
exhibits IR bands at 1 768, 1 284 and 1 256 cm1, assigned to the formation of
a ﬁve-member cycle MgC2H4CO2 through the formation of a C–C bond
between ethylene and carbon dioxide (binding energy 18 kcal mol1).
B [52, 53] promotes the CO2 to CO conversion and the reaction B + CO2 ! BO +
CO is exothermic by 64 kcal mol1. The recombination of BO and CO leads to
OBCO (νCO ¼ 1 863 cm1) and is barrier-free [53].
Al atoms react with CO2 in Ar matrices [54] leading to the formation of AlCO2
moieties from which two isomers originate, according to the temperature. At low
temperature, the adduct presents a Cs symmetry, with two non-equivalent CO

55
bonds, whereas at higher temperature (25 K) a ring structure is formed in which Al
interacts with both oxygen atoms. Above 30 K, the cluster structure yields Al2O
and CO.
The ﬁrst attempts to isolate TM–CO2 systems were made by Ozin et al. [55] who
used Ag and Au atoms. Fragmentary information remained available on
TM-systems (a π-adduct reported for Cu [56] and the formation of OM
(CO) moieties with Cr and W [57]) until a systematic study on metals belonging
to the ﬁrst row was made [58, 59]. It was shown that early metals (Ti, V, Cr) cause
splitting of one of the C¼O bonds and the formation of the O¼M(CO) moiety,
whereas late metals form adducts of formula M–CO2 in which the cumulene shows
divers modes of bonding dependent on the metal. A side-on bonding was found for
Ni, an O-end-on for Cu, and a η1-C for Fe and Co. Interestingly, the same
coordination modes were found for atoms and metal complexes (see above).
DFT calculations have been used for modelling the conversion of M–CO2 into
O¼M(CO). Papai et al. [60] have shown that no energy barrier exists for the
conversion of Ti(CO2) into O¼TiCO with ground state Ti (Fig. 2.4). The compar-
ison of the calculated data with those Ti(CO2) complexes in various coordination
modes were located on the triplet and quintet potential surfaces, with the triplet
state (O,O) coordination being the most stable, and lying above the OTiCO
molecule by about 30 kcal mol1. Hwang et al. [61] have shown that the most
energetically favourable reaction mechanism is the insertion of the Ti atom into the
C¼O bond of the η2(C,O) Ti(CO2) complex, to produce the triplet OTi
(CO) molecule.
It should be noted that the early transition metal atoms (Sc, Ti, V) are more
active than Group 3 metal atoms in promoting the M–CO2 into O¼M
(CO) conversion, most probably because of a better stabilization of the C¼O
fragment formed from CO2.
Ni has been intensively investigated and shown that the reaction is initiated with
an electron transfer from the Ni atom to the CO2 molecule, followed by the C¼O

bond cleavage: such steps occur in a concerted mode together with the charge
transfer processes, without a preliminary formation of a η2-CO2 complex.
Metals belonging to the second and third rows, which are used in several
catalytic processes, have been intensively studied. Zr [62], Nb [63] and Ta [64]
atoms show the formation of OM(CO) and O2M(CO)2 products. The process is
barrierless for Zr, whereas Nb and Ta transfer electrons to CO2 and promote the
formation of adducts as intermediates. Laser ablated Co and Rh atoms [65] show
similar reactions with formation of neutral species such as OM(CO), O2M(CO) and
OCo2(CO). Laser ablated Re, Ru and Os atoms in Ar and Ne matrices [66, 67]
afford divers species of the type OM(CO), O2M(CO) and O2Os(CO)2 (formed by
reaction of OOs(CO) with a second CO2 molecule), and OCRu(O2)(CO) obtained
by addition of a CO2 molecule to ORu(CO). Osmium is more reactive than
ruthenium.
Heavy metals such as lanthanides or actinides have been investigated. La atoms
[65]
afford
OLa(CO)
as
the
primary
product.
Upon
UV-visible
photo-
rearrangement, La(η2-CO)O and OLa(η2-CO) are formed. Noticeably, the compar-
ison of the CO stretching frequency of OMCO species in the series Sc, Y and La
indicates an increase of the metal d orbital ! CO π* back-donation from Sc to
La. In the case of uranium [68], pulsed laser evaporated U atoms are sufﬁciently
energetic to insert into CO2 upon condensation in argon matrices, forming OUCO
(1 799, 804 cm1), with a larger charge transfer from OU to CO than for
OBCO [53].
On the basis of the above studies, it can be ruled out that metal systems interact
with CO2 in low temperature matrices with formation of metal complexes, which
may or may not be the precursors of the O¼M(CO) species, the product of a formal
insertion of the M-atom into one of the two C¼O bonds of CO2. Although “naked”
metal atoms cannot be compared to “LnM” systems, the ensemble of the two types
of metal systems allow the identiﬁcation of general trends in the periodic table for
what concerns the description of the modes of bonding of CO2 in M(CO2) moieties
and can depict a reaction mechanism for their further conversion into O¼M
(CO) species.
2.9
Interaction of Metal Cations with CO2 in the Gas Phase
CO2 reacts with early transition metal cations (Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, La, Hf, Ta, W) [68,
69] with O atom transfer to afford “MO+ + CO”. The driving force is the high
O-afﬁnity of the cations which leads to stable MO+ moieties.
Transition metals from Groups 8 to 12 bind CO2 and form M+(CO2)n adducts
with n varying from 1 to 4. Metal cations are electrostatically bound to the negative
quadrupole moment of CO2 in an end-on way. Obviously, the major stabilizing
strength is the donation O-to-metal cation which does not contribute to the stabi-
lization of the adduct as the π-back-donation is close to zero [70]. The M+–CO2
bond distances depend on both the size of the cation and its electronic conﬁguration,
2.9
Interaction of Metal Cations with CO2 in the Gas Phase
57
and the binding energies follow the trend of the ion size and the repulsion between
the metal cation d-orbitals and the CO2 occupied orbitals, the order of repulsion
being 3dσ > 3dπ > 3dδ. The binding energies usually vary between 10 (Mn and Fe)
and 25 kcal mol1.
CO2-clusters are also formed with V, Ni and Fe adducts. The general formula is
M+(CO2)n, with n up to 11 for V [71], and 14 for Ni [72] and Fe [73]. Reactions of
iron clusters Fen
+ (n ¼ 1–18) with CO2 give FenO+ as primary product. FenCO2
+
adducts are formed for large cluster ions (n > 9) at low kinetic energies [74]. In
agreement with theoretical calculations [70–72], the dissociation energy of the
linear end-on Fe+–CO2 adduct has been measured to be 14.3 kcal mol1 [75]. Reac-
tion of ground state copper Cu+ [76] with CO2 might form CuO+ and CO, a reaction
which is endothermic and spin limited. Pt+ [77] forms an associative nonlinear
end-on complex Pt+.OCO, with subsequent formation of the ﬁnal product O–Pt+–
CO. Al+ [78] produces AlO+ + CO. Finally, U+ can give UO+ + CO, an exothermic
reaction by 2.1 eV, which has a low cross section [79].
2.10
Reactions of Coordinated CO2
It is uncontroversial that the coordination of CO2 to a metal centre causes a
perturbation of the cumulene molecular structure, which is made evident by the
changes of the properties of CO2. The shift from the free molecule may be quite
important or less relevant, depending on the mode of bonding to the metal centre.
However, the deviation of the molecular structure from linearity, the elongation or
shortening of C–O bonds, and the shift of the ν(C¼Ο) IR absorptions towards
lower-energy and low ﬁeld appearance of 13C-NMR signals are evidence of the
changes occurring in coordinated CO2 with respect to the free molecule. One can
now ask whether such changes give an indication of the reactivity of the bonded
cumulene, or else whether the coordination of CO2 is a strict pre-requisite for
further conversion, or else if there is a preferred bonding mode for CO2 conversion,
which must be the electronic properties of the M–CO2 system for this may represent
a reactive form of CO2. There is no general answer to such questions, as the
behaviour of M–CO2 systems is very dependent on the reaction conditions and
the co-reagents. Whether a substrate reacts with coordinated CO2 or free CO2 reacts
with a coordinated substrate, or even whether a three-centre reaction takes place
implying the metal centre, CO2 and the substrate, is not a priori deﬁnable in a
general way and whether coordinated CO2 is necessary or not is the leitmotif for
several reactions in which CO2 is implied. Let us consider a simple example: the
reaction of 1 with ethene. It has been shown in previous paragraphs that 1 in
solution may not be a rigid molecule: temperature and solvent determine for CO2
the mode of being attached to the metal. If ethene is added to a solution of 1 in
toluene at room temperature, the exchange reaction depicted in (2.2) takes place

and the ethene-Ni complex is isolated in quantitative yields. Increasing the pressure
of CO2 and ethene and lowering the temperature favours the coupling of both
reagents (2.3) onto a putative “(L–L)Ni” moiety. At 240 K ethene and CO2 may
also couple at sub-atmospheric pressure of CO2. The coupling is favoured when
bidentate ligands (dppe, depe, bpy) are used:
ð2:3Þ
Such a reaction, as stated in the rest of this book, strongly depends on the metal as to
what is the nature of the C–C coupling product.
Nevertheless, although several reactions of CO2 can be categorized as insertion
of CO2 into active M–E bonds (E ¼ H, O, C, N, P, S and others), there are reactions
which clearly require coordinated CO2 to occur. The following chapters make a
detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism of CO2 conversion; here we discuss a
few examples of reactivity of coordinated CO2 with nucleophiles or electrophiles.

When the conversion of CO2 into CO upon coordination to a metal centre was
ﬁrst discovered [3, 81] it opened up great expectations, as running such a cycle as
that represented in Scheme 2.8 would be of great practical interest.
It must be said that the non-catalyzed CO2 conversion into CO and “O” requires
high temperature (>1 200 K) or high radiation energy (<160 nm) (see Chap. 1).
The effect of coordination to a metal is now quite evident as the “deoxygenation” of
CO2 can be performed at room temperature using the appropriate metal centre and

“oxophile”. Unfortunately, the best O-acceptors are phosphanes (PR3) [82, 83]
which are converted into their oxides (O¼PR3), products of very limited utility
and difﬁcult to reduce back to the parent compounds without the use of energy-
intensive reducing agents (metals) which cancel out the beneﬁt of having the CO2
splitting running at room temperature. Similar reactions have been shown in
previous paragraphs to occur with metal atoms, which also cannot be easily and
advantageously converted back to their reduced forms. As a matter of fact, today
the O-transfer process (or CO2 reduction to CO) is still under examination and
theoretical calculations are useful tools for the design of metal systems (MOFs are
the preferred ones [84]) which might be used as promoters of cyclic processes. The
theoretical approach is particularly interesting when one wishes to explore the role
of particular metals. In fact, DFT calculations have shown that although the d3 Mo
(NRAr)3 triamide complexes (R ¼ aliphatic group, Ar ¼ aryl moiety) are known not
to be able to react with CO2, by changing the central atom to a d2 conﬁguration a
favourable interaction with CO2 was postulated.
Discovering a cyclic process that runs on CO2–CO and makes use of perennial
energy sources (solar energy) as energy input would be of great interest. Metal
oxides have been studied as catalysts for such reaction with use of Solar Power
Concentrators allowing one to operate at high temperature. An interesting metal
mediated deoxygenation of CO2 is implemented based on reactions (2.4)–(2.7).

The produced CO can either be used as a fuel (2.6) or used in combination with H2
obtained from water splitting for the production of liquid fuels (2.7).
An intriguing use of CO2 as O-transfer agent driven by metal catalysts has been
investigated by Park [85] who used CO2 as oxidant in combination with dioxygen.
The reaction investigated was the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford
styrene (2.8). As H2O and CO can be processed to afford H2 and CO2 (WGS)
(2.9), the net reaction is represented in

(2.10) in which CO2 acts as “promoter” of the dehydrogenation, favouring milder
conditions and higher selectivity with respect to pure dioxygen. Reactions (2.8)–
(2.10) are discussed in detail in Chap. 7. Coordinated CO2 undergoes attack by
several electrophiles, as shown in Scheme 2.9. The proton “H+” is a common
reagent.

The reduction of CO2 to CO occurs at the expense of the metal, which is oxidized:
in order to be able to repeat the cycle, the metal must be reduced to its original
oxidation state. The utilization of PhSH as a source of protons and electrons has
been demonstrated and is an interesting biomimetic system. Both diphenyldi-

As shown in Scheme 2.4, the hydrido complex can interact with CO2 and a
carbonyl bicarbonate complex is formed. In recent years the chemistry of “M–H
CO2” systems has reached high levels of attention because of the TM catalysed
conversion of CO2 and H2 into formic acid (see Chaps. 3 and 4).
Scheme 2.10 Putative transition states for the insertion of CO2 into a Ru–H bond. Reprinted with
permission from [94]. Copyright (2001) American Chemical Society
The hydride migration from Fe, Ru and Os hydrides to CO2 has been theoreti-
cally studied using DFT. The key issue was again to determine whether an insertion
of free CO2 did occur in the M–H bond, or the hydride migrated to CO2 coordinated
to the metal [94] (Scheme 2.10).
A phosphine bearing a pending amine was used as ligand, with the amine as
potential support in H-transfer or as stabilizing agent. The reactivity order was
found to be Fe > Ru > Os.
The proposed mechanism says that with Fe the hydride migration to coordinated
CO2 takes place, whereas Ru and Os follow the alternative path with attack of free
CO2 onto the M–H bond.
Fe(CO2)(depe)2 has been shown to react with MeI or MeOTf to give Me2O and
the cationic iron(II) carbonyl complexes [FeX(CO)(depe)2]+X, with X ¼ I or OTf
[95]. Conversely, R3SiCl (R ¼ Me or Ph) in Et2O at 195 K converts Fe(CO2)(depe)2
into the iron carboxylate complex FeCl(CO2SiR3)(depe)2 which clearly results
from the attack of the electrophilic R3Si+ moiety on one oxygen of the coordinated
CO2. In the latter case, the moiety “Fe-C(O)OSiR3” is less prone to further reaction
than the analogous “Fe-C(O)OR” which is quite stable per se [96, 97], but
undergoes reaction with the alkylating agent RX to form the carbonyl complex
[FeX(CO)(depe)2]+X. The formation of the latter takes place via direct addition of
the methylcation to the O atom of the -OR moiety of the carboxylate.

Silylation reactions have long been studied [89] with the hope of ﬁnding a catalytic
system for CO2 to CO conversion. Stoichiometric reaction or TON of a very few
units were reported. Recently, a combined experimental–theoretical study was
carried out on the hydrosilylation of carbon dioxide by Me2PhSiH with ruthenium
nitrile complexes mer-(RuX3(MeCN)3) and cis/trans-(RuX2(MeCN)4) with X ¼ Br

and Cl [98]. The Me3Si moiety was proposed to be transferred ﬁrst to a coordinated
halide and from such a position to the side-on coordinated CO2 to Ru with
elimination of Me3SiOCHO. The order of reactivity for CO2 hydrosilylation was
reported to be RuClmLn > RuBrmLn and RuIII > RuII. The silyl transfer from
R3SiCl–M to the oxygen atom of the η2-bound CO2 has been reported to be the
highest in energy in the proposed pathway. More applications of the CO2 insertion
into the Si–H bond are discussed in Chap. 4.
2.10.2
Reactions of Coordinated CO2 with Nucleophiles
Reactions with nucleophiles are much less documented in the literature. On the
basis of what has been discussed above, one can observe that if the C atom of the
cumulene is engaged with bonding to a metal in a side-on C,O-coordination mode,
then it is less likely to become engaged in the reaction with a second nucleophile.
Conversely, if O-end-on forms of coordinated CO2 are considered, then the nucle-
ophilic attack at C should be likely. Any electron-rich species is a potential reagent:
H, OH, OR, NR3, NR2
, RR0R00C and so on. In this case too, the question is
open as to whether coordinated CO2 is necessary or whether free CO2 may interact
with the “catalyst activated” nucleophile to afford a carboxylate which is then
bound to the metal centre.
Recently, in a theoretical study [99] of the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid
using RuII catalysts in presence of water, no coordination of CO2 to the metal centre
was identiﬁed, but low energy assemblages with the C and O atoms of CO2
interacting with H bound to the metal or the H+ of H2O. In the absence of
water, CO2 directly coordinates to the Ru center to afford Ru(H)2(η2-CO2)
(PMe3)3. The Ru-(η1-formate) intermediate is produced via CO2 interaction with
the M–H bond more than attack by the H on coordinated CO2.
Using kinetic measurements, Konno et al. [100] have shown that the nucleo-
philic attack of the hydride ligand of Ru(tpy)(4,40-X2bpy)H+ (X ¼ H, MeO) to the
carbon atom of CO2 was the rate-determining step for the formation of the formate
complex Ru(tpy)(4,40-X2bpy)(OCHO)+, whereas the coordination of CO2 to the
metal, either in η1-O or η2-C,O mode, does not play any important role in the
transition state.
A nucleophilic attack has been invoked in the case of reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(η2-
CO2) with R3P¼CH2 in a Wittig-like reaction [101]. In the Wittig reaction, a (2 + 2)
cycloaddition, strong nucleophiles such as trialkyl phosphorus ylides R3P¼CH2
and organic ketones or aldehydes react to form alkenes. Actually, CO2 bubbled into
THF containing Me3P¼CH2 affords the free ketene CH2¼C¼O which immediately
dimerizes to methylene-β-propiolactone. Ketenes can be stabilized by coordination
to transition metal complexes in a η2-C,O (for early transition metals) or η2-C,C (for
late transition metals) manner. In this study, complex 1 was reacted with
Me3P¼CH2 in toluene at 253 K for 2 h and a nickel ketene complex (Cy3P)2Ni
(η2-C,O)–CH2¼CO was isolated and characterized (IR bands at 1 611 and
2.10
Reactions of Coordinated CO2
63
1 570 cm1). The reaction mechanism is not clearly stated, as it could well be a
nucleophilic attack by the ylide onto the coordinated CO2, but could also be
explained in terms of CO2 dissociation from Ni, reacting with the ylide in solution
to form the ketene which is then coordinated to nickel. The unusual η2-C,O ketene
bonding to Ni seems to be more in favour of a nucleophilic attack on the coordi-
nated CO2.
2.11
Conclusions
The coordination of CO2 to metal centres has been demonstrated to occur via the C
or O atom, or else through the O,C or O,O atoms, or else through the three OCO
atoms. The molecular geometry and structural parameters have been deﬁned by
XRD. Alternative tools for getting information and multinuclear NMR about the
structure of TM–CO2 complexes have been developed which imply IR studies and
use of theoretical calculations. The rigidity or ﬂuxionality of the complexes has also
been investigated. The effective involvement of coordinated CO2 with metal
centres in reactions involving the O atoms has been documented much more
frequently than the reaction at the C atom of the coordinated molecule. The
knowledge of the modes of bonding of CO2 has considerably increased since the
ﬁrst stable CO2 complex Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2 was structurally characterized 40 years
ago [3]. The relevance of such modes of bonding to the reactivity of the cumulene
still leaves open questions which require an answer.
The huge advancement of theoretical calculations (parallel computers) and their
application to systems that are more and more complex and close to real metal
complexes are good support to foreseeing the properties of the TM–CO2 complexes
and simulating their reactivity. Spectroscopic techniques, more and more sophisti-
cated, allow the identiﬁcation and characterization of stable complexes or of short-
lived species so far difﬁcult to identify, and, thus, give support to the deﬁnition of
the reaction mechanisms. Still a number of issues remain open and need investiga-
tion. One of these is the co-operative effect of ancillary ligands. Several basic
reactions still need a correct understanding for they can be exploited in synthetic
applications.

Chapter 3
Interaction of CO2 with Electron-Rich
Moieties
Abstract In this chapter the direct, non-metal-mediated interaction of carbon
dioxide with electron-rich elemental or molecular species is discussed. Anionic
species such as H, OH, and R3C and covalent species such as amines have been
taken into consideration, in view of their relevance to systems of potential or real
industrial interest.
3.1
Reaction with the Hydride Ion
Hydrides can be categorized in various classes according to the nature of the bond
that links the metal and hydrogen. The following categories can usually be found in
the literature: ionic hydrides (hydrides with group 1 and 2 elements), covalent
hydrides, polymeric hydrides, metallic hydrides, borderline hydrides, and transition
metal complex hydrides. Here the reaction of ionic hydrides with carbon dioxide
(CO2) is considered. Transition metal hydrides with the formula LnM–H are
discussed in Chap. 4, where the interaction of CO2 with analogous E–X systems
(where E and X are different elements) is discussed.
Group 1 and group 2 hydrides are ionic, insoluble in aprotic solvents, and not
usable in protic solvents such as water and alcohols because they promptly react
with H2 evolution:
MþH þ H2O ! MþOH þ H2
ð3:1Þ
The ionic hydrides are thermally very stable and have quite high melting
temperatures. Depending on the element, they can melt without (CaH2) or with
(LiH, NaH, and others) decomposition. NaH decomposes above 573 K, whereas
LiH and CaH2 are stable up to 900 K.
Therefore, the reaction of ionic hydrides with CO2 mostly implies a heteroge-
neous, biphasic system in which pressurized CO2 reacts at a temperature of ~473 K
with the MH (M ¼ Li, H, K, Rb) or MH2 (Ca, Ba, Sr) species to afford the relevant
formate:

Although such a reaction has been known for a long time, it has never found any
practical application for the synthesis of formates, which are more conveniently

The reaction mechanism of (3.2) is quite simple and linear because it involves
the attack of the ionic hydride at the electrophilic C of CO2 (Scheme 3.1).
The resulting formate anion is stabilized by interaction with the metal cation.
The literature does not offer much information on such reactive systems in terms of
kinetic studies, thermodynamics of reaction, and so on, most likely because of the
harsh reaction conditions and limited practical interest of the reactions. The avail-
able information points to a kinetic law of an overall second-order reaction, i.e.,
rate ¼ k[H][CO2].
3.2
Reaction with Hydroxide and Alkoxide Species
The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n] or alkoxides [M(OR)n]
is of quite different interest than the reaction with hydride systems. The kinetics of
the reaction was investigated as early as 1924 [1, 2] in systems involving an inﬁnite
dilution of hydroxide ions or the co-presence of both OH and RO anions that
were competing for small amounts of CO2. Such studies were repeated later [3, 4] in
an attempt to determine the kinetic constants for the reactions better. However, such
studies demonstrate the long-lasting interest of such topic. More recently, more
sophisticated techniques have been used [5, 6]. Such studies have clearly shown
that the reaction mechanism can be described as shown in Scheme 3.2, in which the
hydroxide anion attacks the electrophilic carbon of CO2.
The rate constants were dependent on the cation and the ionic strength
[7]. Today this topic is of great interest, linked to the utilization of the reaction
depicted in Scheme 3.2 for the separation of CO2 from ﬂue gases. However, new
emphasis has been put on the topic for the correct determination of the rate
constants in a wider range of temperatures and conditions for better reversibility

Reaction (3.4) is also of great interest for the ﬁxation of CO2 into inorganic
carbonates (3.6) which have been considered as potential compounds for the safe
storage of CO2 for a long time:

Reaction with Carbanions
The reaction of carbanions with CO2 has also been known for a long time. Such
reaction has a key role in natural (de)carboxylation processes. The most classic
example is given by the reaction of a Grignard reagent with CO2:

ð3:7Þ
R ¼ alkyl or aryl moiety
In this case the reaction mechanism is also quite straightforward: the carbanion
attacks the electrophilic carbon of CO2 producing the carboxylate. The latter can be
converted into the relevant acid by reaction with an inorganic strong acid such as
HCl or, even better, H2SO4. Such reaction, even if it addresses a synthetic require-
ment of great industrial relevance such as the synthesis of carboxylic acids, has no
practical application as it consumes 1 mol of Mg per mol of carboxylate produced,
resulting in an energy-intensive methodology (the preparation of the Grignard
demands elemental Mg produced by electrolysis) and is not too friendly from the
environmental point of view because of the use of halogens and production of large

amounts of inorganic salts as waste. Therefore, its application is only tutorial or, at
best, usable on a small laboratory scale for some specialty products.
3.4
Reaction with Amines
The reaction of CO2 with organic amines (RR0R00N, ArNH2; R ¼ H or aliphatic
moiety, Ar ¼ aromatic moiety) is of great interest as the aliphatic members have
been used for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream or for synthetic purposes (3.8). The
reactivity of amines with CO2 depends on the nature of the organic moiety they bear
and the reaction conditions. In fact, under strictly anhydrous conditions, although
tertiary aliphatic amines do not absorb CO2, aliphatic primary and secondary
amines, as well as ammonia itself, react quickly with carbon dioxide to form the
corresponding ammonium carbamates (3.8) which, in a few cases, have been fully
characterized in the solid state by X-ray diffraction [10, 11].

Aromatic amines hardly react with carbon dioxide because of their poorer
basicity/nucleophilicity [12]. However, in the presence of suitable auxiliary strong
bases (B), such as amidines or pentaalkylguanidine superbases, carbamate salts
(BH)O2CNRAr (R ¼ H, alkyl) can be generated in solution, as revealed by spec-
troscopic and reactivity data [13]. It has been shown that even tributylamine may be
effective if a suitable alkali metal salt is present in the reaction mixture: in the latter
case, the N-arylcarbamate has been isolated as an alkali salt (3.10) [14, 15].

The reaction of 15N-labeled primary amines with 13CO2 in the presence of a
strong base such as N-cyclohexyl-N0,N0,N00,N00-tetramethylguanidine (CyTMG)
deserves attention. In CH3CN, in the presence of 2 equiv. of CyTEG, Et15NH2
undergoes double carboxylation with formation of Et15N(13CO2)2
2(+HCyTMG)2,
as evidenced by means of 15N and 13C NMR spectroscopy. However, with Ph15NH2

and the ratio of the two species was highly dependent on the temperature at which

dioxide to give Bn2NC(O)OH [17]. Spectroscopic (IR) and gas volumetric mea-
surements showed that Bn2NC(O)OH formed by carbonation of dibenzylamine
through the intermediacy (3.9) of the dialkylammonium carbamate salt (Bn2NH2)
O2CNBn2 [11, 17]. Compounds CoCl(NO)2[PhP(OCH2CH2)2N–CO2H] and
Bn2NC(O)OH are unique examples of derivatives of the elusive carbamic acid
H2NCO2H, which have been isolated and fully characterized. In both cases single-
crystal X-ray analysis has shown that the relevant carbamic acid molecules are
organized in an H-bonded dimeric structure (Fig. 3.1).
The isolation of both CoCl(NO)2[PhP(OCH2CH2)2N–CO2H] and Bn2NC(O)OH
demonstrates that carbonation of secondary amine to the corresponding carbamic
acid can be a thermodynamically favorable process, depending on the nature of the
amine substituents and the selected reaction conditions. It should be noted that
whether the formation of the carbamic acid is or is not a direct insertion of CO2 into
the N–H bond (3.11) has been argued over for a long time and is still a controversial
issue (see also Chap. 4). A key factor in the stabilization of the acid is the
establishment of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network in the solid state.

bands produced by free amine (3390 and 3320 cm1) and free CO2 (2340 cm1),
together with absorptions at 1725 and 1685 cm1 (shifted to 1678 and 1643 cm1,
respectively, upon 13CO2 labeling) which were produced by the mono- and dimeric

complex behavior and can convert into the corresponding monomeric carbamic
acid RNHCO2H, which can either decarboxylate or undergo self-association with
formation of dimers [18].
A somewhat different behavior has been described for unsubstituted carbamic
acid H2NCO2H [10, 11]. The latter species has not yet been isolated as a pure
compound, but it has been detected by several methods, including IR spectroscopy.
Based on its low-temperature IR spectrum, it has been proposed that the stability of
such a compound in the solid phase may be caused by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding of the zwitterion form H3N+COO [20]. It is worth noting that gaseous
carbamic
acid
is
unstable
with

to
decomposition
into
NH4(O2CNH2)(s) + CO2(g) and into NH3(g) + CO2(g) (ΔH ¼ 26 kJ/mol) [21,
22]. According to a few theoretical studies, the zwitterion H3N+CO2
 has been
calculated to be less stable than monomeric acid H2NCO2H and, therefore, the
zwitterion form has been proposed as the most probable intermediate for the
decomposition of gaseous carbamic acid to ammonia and CO2 [22].
The reaction of amines with CO2 to afford the corresponding carbamate has been
the subject of extended kinetics studies [23]. In most cases, water was used as
reaction medium, wherein hydrolytic processes forming hydrogencarbonate
((3.12)–(3.14)) can also occur and compete with carbamate

formation. The reaction of carbon dioxide with primary or secondary amines was
found to be of ﬁrst kinetic order with respect to CO2 concentration, but can exhibit
complicated reaction orders depending on the amine.
Scheme 3.4 illustrates the mechanism proposed by Danckwerts for the conversion
of amines and CO2 into alkylammonium carbamates [24]. This two-step pathway
implies the direct reaction of the amine with CO2 to give a zwitterion intermediate
species [25], which undergoes deprotonation by a base B, thus converting into the
carbamate product. The base B is the amine itself under anhydrous conditions, but in
aqueous medium this role may also be played by H2O or OH.

Scheme 3.4 Carbamate formation from amines and carbon dioxide: zwitterion mechanism

where Σkb[B] is the contribution to the removal of the proton by all bases present in
solution (H2O, OH, R2NH). For non-aqueous solvents, only the amine can be
regarded as the deprotonating base.
According to (3.15), the reaction rate may show a fractional kinetic order,
between one and two, with respect to amine concentration. When zwitterion
deprotonation is much faster than zwitterion splitting (Σkb[B]  k1), zwitterion
formation is the rate determining step and (3.15) becomes (3.16):

In this case the reaction rate is of ﬁrst order with respect to the amine and the overall

According to (3.17), a fractional overall reaction order between two and three
may be observed. In the asymptotic case wherein the amine contribution to zwit-
terion deprotonation is much more important than that of H2O and OH, an overall
kinetic order of three can be found, as, in this case, the reaction rate are of ﬁrst order
with respect to [CO2] and of second order with respect to [R2NH].
The case of sterically hindered amines deserves a comment. In general, steric
hindrance at the nitrogen atom does not seem to prevent carbamate formation under
anhydrous conditions [17]. However, sterically hindered amines are poorly reactive
with CO2 in water, where hydrogencarbonate rather than carbamate may form, not
only according to reactions (3.12)–(3.14), but also through a

Crooks and Donnellan [26], studying the kinetics of formation of N,N-
dialkylcarbamate from DEA (2,20-iminodiethanol; diethanolamine) and carbon diox-
ide in anhydrous ethanol, emphasized that the kinetics results were consistent with
both the zwitterion mechanism and a single-step termolecular reaction (Scheme 3.5).
In subsequent work [27], they showed that the termolecular mechanism is also a good
model for the carbamation of several primary and secondary amines in water, as
supported by the large negative values of activation entropy. This mechanism may be
regarded as the borderline case of the Danckwerts mechanism for k1  Σkb[B]. The
initial product is not a zwitterion, but a loosely-bound encounter complex. Most of
these complexes break up to give reagent molecules (CO2 and amine) again; however,
a few of them can react with a second molecule of amine or a water molecule to give
ionic products. This mechanism has been revisited from a theoretical point of view by
da Silva and Svendsen for the speciﬁc case of MEA (2-aminoethanol; monoetha-
nolamine) and DEA [28]. The ab initio calculations suggested that a single-step, third-
order reaction was the most likely. It would seem unlikely that a zwitterion interme-
diate with a signiﬁcant lifetime may be present in the system.
Tertiary amines cannot form carbamates, but they react with CO2 in aqueous
solvents to form hydrogencarbonate (3.20). Yu and Astarita [29] studied the
kinetics of the absorption of carbon dioxide in MDEA (bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
methylamine; N-methyldiethanolamine) solutions and
78

concluded that MDEA acted as a homogeneous catalyst for CO2 hydrolysis. As a
result, the rate of CO2 absorption in aqueous MDEA solutions was signiﬁcantly
larger than one would calculate by simply taking into account the alkalinity of the
reaction. They proposed a zwitterion-type mechanism summarized by (3.21) and
(3.22). Equation (3.22) describes the homogeneous hydrolysis reaction of an unsta-
ble amine–CO2 adduct, which reacts with water to form hydrogencarbonate anion.

Scheme 3.6 Hydrogencarbonate formation from tertiary amines and carbon dioxide: termolecular
mechanism
Crooks and Donnellan [30] investigated the kinetics of the reaction between CO2
and
tertiary
amines,
such
as
MDEA
and
TEA
(2,20,200-nitrilotriethanol;
triethanolamine) in water. A single step termolecular mechanism was proposed
(Scheme 3.6) to be operative in this case, as suggested by the reaction order and the
large negative activation entropy.
N-Substituted carbamic acids or their anions play a key role as intermediates in
several biological processes (carboxylations by biotin enzymes; photosynthetic
activation of CO2 promoted by Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase);
glucuronidation, etc.) [10, 11, 31, 32].
Nowadays, the chemistry of amines with CO2 is drawing more and more attention,
mainly because of its potential applications [10, 11]. In addition to the traditional uses
in chemical industry (Solvay process, synthesis of urea), new applications have begun
to emerge. Because of their modest thermal stability, alkylammonium carbamates
can release CO2 upon heating (Scheme 3.3). This property may be useful in several
circumstances. For instance, amines (MEA, DEA, TEA, MDEA, etc.) and polymer-
bound amines are being investigated as reusable “CO2 scrubbers” for removing
carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust streams [23, 33–36]. To this end, ionic liquids
and MOF (Metal Organic Framework) incorporating –NH2 groups in their structure
are also under study [33–36]. This method has also been extended to the use of
multiple amine-containing dendrimers [37, 38]. The dynamic CO2–amine chemistry
has been successfully exploited for the reversible formation of organogels by expos-
ing solutions of some long-chain alkylamines to CO2 [39, 40] or to build up
supramolecular polymers [41, 42]. Thermally reversible carbamate chemistry has
3.4
Reaction with Amines
79
recently been employed for molecular imprinting of polymers [43] and for preparing
switching-polarity solvents [44, 45].
Alkylammonium, as well as metal and p-block carbamates (see Chap. 4), are
potential carriers or sources of carbamic group and, if the transfer of “RR0NCO2”
moiety to a suitable organic substrate is accomplished, can be used in the synthesis of
organic carbamates, which are potential precursors of ureas and/or isocyanates
[10]. To date, much effort has been made to develop new safe CO2-based synthetic
methodologies for these classes of chemicals, usually obtained through hazardous
phosgenation methods [46, 47].
The transfer of the carbamic group from carbamate sources to a suitable elec-
trophilic organic substrate is not a banal step. Carbamate anion, RR0NCO2
, is a
remarkable case of an ambident nucleophile as it shows two sites for interacting
with an electrophile, E (Scheme 3.7): the oxygen ends and the carbamic nitrogen
atom. Formation of carbamate ester requires the electrophilic attack by E to be
addressed to one of the O-atoms (Scheme 3.7a). This results in the incorporation of
originally ﬁxed CO2 into the

Scheme 3.7 Interaction of carbamate group with an electrophile E
“RR0NCO2” group of a carbamate ester (Scheme 3.7a0). Conversely, electrophilic
attack directed to the nitrogen atom (Scheme 3.7b) causes elimination of CO2 from
the carbamic moiety and formation of undesired side-products (Scheme 3.7b0).
The reactivity of ionic carbamates, such as alkylammonium or alkali carba-
mates, with alkyl halides can be directed towards O-carbamation, rather than
N-alkylation, if a suitable complexing agent for the countercation is used [14, 48–
50]. In the absence of any complexing agent, the strong interactions between the
cation and carbamate anion depress the nucleophilicity of carbamic oxygens and
alkyl halides react with the nitrogen atom, despite the delocalization of the nitrogen
lone-pair on the carboxyl group. The complexing agent, by spreading and shielding
the positive charge of the cation, originates much looser interactions between the
cation and the O-ends of carbamate anion, whose O-nucleophilicity is thus
increased. Thus, anion–cation interactions seem to play a key role in this chemistry.
Aresta and Quaranta [18] investigated the direct reaction of aliphatic primary
amines with alkyl halides in the presence of carbon dioxide. Under the working
conditions (293–353 K; 0.1 MPa CO2; solvent ¼ THF, MeOH, PhCH3/CH2Cl2
mixtures) the formation of carbamate ester was not observed at all or occurred

Interaction of CO2 with Electron-Rich Moieties
only to a very low extent. The reaction afforded mainly N-alkylation products,
which may form by direct alkylation of free amine present at equilibrium or be the
result of electrophilic attack by alkyl halide at the carbamic nitrogen atom of
carbamate anion or other carbamic species (RNHCO2H, [RNHC(O)OH]2; see
Scheme 3.3) present in the reaction mixture.
The synthesis of carbamate esters RNHC(O)OR0 from primary amines, CO2, and
R0X implies O-alkylation of the intermediate ionic carbamate (RNH3)O2CNHR and
requires that the reactivity of (RNH3)O2CNHR towards R0X has to be modiﬁed.
This result was achieved by working in the presence of a suitable macrocyclic
polyether. In the presence of 18-crown-6, O-alkylation can occur in competition
with N-alkylation and organic carbamates were obtained in satisfactory yields at
ambient temperature [18]. The change of reactivity was ascribed to the formation of
a
“host–guest”
adduct
(Scheme
3.8)
between
the
crown-ether
and
the
alkylammonium cation RNH3
+. The crown-ether can both increase the solubility
of carbamate salt, usually poorly soluble in most organic solvents, and change the
reactivity of carbamate anion as an ambident nucleophile. Ionic association phe-
nomena, caused by hydrogen bonding between alkylammonium cation and carba-
mate anion, can strongly depress the O-nucleophilicity of these salts. Complexation

anion–cation interactions and enhances O-nucleophilicity of carbamate anion. An
analogous change of reactivity was observed by complexing the alkali cation of
Group 1 metal carbamates with suitable crown-ethers or cryptands [48–50].
A remarkable enhancement of the O-nucleophilicity of carbamate anion can be
achieved if the counterion (BH+) is a highly polarizable cation, characterized by an
extended delocalization of the positive charge. As already noted (see above),
carbamate salts (BH)O2CNRR0 can be generated by reacting amines with CO2 in
the presence of strong bases, such as amidines, pentaalkylguanidines, and
phosphazenes [10, 13]. In the presence of the above superbases, amines and CO2
react with alkyl halides, generating carbamate esters with high yield. The strong
base B not only drives the formation of carbamate salt, favoring a higher salt
concentration in solution, but also facilitates the formation of a “naked” RR0NCO2

carbamate ion, more effectively separated from the countercation, thus making the
O-ends of the anion more prone to electrophilic attack.

Interaction of CO2 with Electron-Rich Moieties
Chapter 4
Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
Abstract This chapter deals with the “insertion” reactions of carbon dioxide (CO2)
into E–X bonds, where E and X represent several different (sets of) atoms, such as
M–H, M–OH, M–C, M–OR, M–O2, M–N, M–P, C–C, C–N, Si–H, and M–M
(M ¼ metal). Such reactions are relevant to catalysis for the formation of new
bonds in which CO2 may be implied (C–C bonds or C–E bonds) and thus to the
conversion of CO2 into added-value chemicals. The insertion product can be
thermodynamically and kinetically stable or labile, offering in the latter case the
opportunity of a catalytic path.
4.1
Carbon Dioxide Insertion into M–H Bonds
The study of the interaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with covalent-polar M–H
bonds reveals quite a different complexity and intriguing reaction mechanisms with
respect to the reaction with ionic metal hydrides, as discussed in Sect. 3.1. As a
matter of fact, the interaction of M–H bonds with CO2 has been debated for quite a
long time [1], and the insertion of the cumulene into M–H bonds has been shown to
follow two routes, as depicted in Scheme 4.1, affording either the M–OCHO group
or the M–COOH moiety, both having an applicative interest.
The two methods of insertion are known as “normal” (1) and “abnormal”
insertion (2). The M–H bond can be considered as a polar bond in which the
metal center usually bears the fraction of positive charge and the negative charge
is accumulated on H (3 in Scheme 4.2). The charge density can be inﬂuenced by the
nature of the metal itself and by the ancillary ligands Ln. The effect can be such that
a sensible modiﬁcation of the charge distribution may also take place, resulting in
the inversion of polarity (4 in Scheme 4.2). This is well known in transition metal
hydrides chemistry; the H atom bonded to a metal can be transferred as an atom [2],
a hydride [3], or a proton [4]. Moreover, the same metal hydride may show a dual
behavior (proton or hydride transfer) according to the receiving substrate [5].
The two forms 3 and 4 in Scheme 4.2 interact with CO2 in different ways and
generate two different transition states, 5 and 6, which eventually generate the
formate and the metallacarboxylate carboxylate. The effect of such interaction is

that the partial charge on the H atom is released to the O atom in 5 or to the C atom
in 6. The conversion of 5 into the relevant end product 1 (Scheme 4.1) is proposed

Scheme 4.2 Transition states for the “normal” and “abnormal” mode of interaction of CO2 with
M–H bonds
through the interaction of the O atom with the metal centre and concurrent cleavage
of the M–H bond. As a matter of fact, a second transition state for such normal
insertion 7 can be foreseen, which corresponds to a formal “2+2” interaction
(Structure 4.1).
There are a number of early kinetic investigations on such reactions that reveal
their reversibility [6–8] and irreversibility [9] and the reaction mechanism [6, 7, 9].
More recent studies of the reaction of CO2 with monohydrido complexes such as
[Re(bpy)(CO)3H] [10] and [Os(bpy)2(CO)H] [10] have clearly shown that the
insertion is a second-order reaction (4.1) inﬂuenced by the solvent.

The ﬁrst order in both the metal hydride and CO2 conﬁrms that 5 and 7 are possible
transition states (TSs). The reaction shows an inverse isotope dependence (kH/
kD ¼ 0.55) [8]. The activation parameters are reported to be ΔH# ¼ 53.5 kJ/mol
and ΔS# ¼ 138 J/mol K. If the ancillary ligands are changed, one can observe an
effect on the reaction rate. This effect can be explained by considering that ancillary
ligands may

Scheme 4.3 Modes of bonding of the formate ion to a metal center
inﬂuence the charge separation on the M–H moiety. In particular, one can envisage
that donor ligands would increase the electron density at the metal center, thus
favoring the transfer of negative charge to H, increasing the polarity of the M–H
bond. Such prediction is conﬁrmed by experimental facts that show that increasing
the donor capacity of the ancillary ligands facilitates the reaction. The variable
polarity of the M–H bond also causes a dependence of the reaction rate on the
nature of the solvent. Such dependence is also explained by taking into account the
asymmetry of charge distribution in species 5 and 7. It is worth emphasizing that the
formate ion can be linked to the metal center in different ways, as shown in
Scheme 4.3.
The mode depends on the nature of the metal center to which the formate is
linked: A coordinative unsaturation of the metal favors the bidentate-chelating
mode of bonding. The oxophilicity of the metal also favors the bonding of oxygen
over other ligands. The linear mode of bonding has been shown to exist in fac-(bpy)
(CO)3Re(OCHO) [2–4], in which the formate is linked to a “pentacoordinated Re”
moiety to afford the ﬁnal esacoordinated Re complex. Conversely, the formate is
bidentate chelating in Ru(PPh3)3H(OCHO), in which the formate [11] is linked to
the unsaturated “tetracoordinated Ru” moiety to afford the coordinatively
saturated Ru(II) complex. The different modes can be distinguished by infrared
(IR) spectroscopy.
The tendency of a transition metal hydride to transfer H to a substrate is called
hydricity [12]. It is possible to determine the Gibbs free energy of the splitting of the
covalent polar M–H bond to afford a metal cation and the hydride ion in solution.
The hydricity is not parallel to the polarity of the M–H bond, nor can it be predicted
on the basis of the electronic structure of the metal atom. It is a complex property
that can be modeled for transition metal hydrides using multiparameter approaches.
The hydricity concept applies to the interaction of M–H bonds with CO2 as well
[13]. The reactivity of M–H bonds toward CO2 is linked to reactions that may have
industrial interest, such as the hydrogenation of CO2 to afford formic acid (4.2) and
the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to other C1 or C1+ molecules (4.3).

The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by transition metal
systems has been much investigated in the past 20 years, and catalysts have been
developed that have a high TON (turnover number) and TOF (turnover frequency)
close to industrial utilization. The drawback in this ﬁeld is the fact that the
intermediate hydrido-formate species LnMH(OCHO) are kinetically stable and
require a shuttle that helps to eliminate the hydride (amines that are converted
into ammonium compounds) or the formate anion (group 1 metal

cations) (Scheme 4.4). However, as well as free formic acid, formates (salts of
group 1 elements or ammonium salts) are obtained [14]. The ﬁrst example of the
homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 was reported by Inoue et al. [15] in 1976.
Since then, a conspicuous number of papers and reviews [16–19] have been
published that have highlighted recent progress. The net reaction (4.2) between
gaseous H2 and CO2 to afford liquid formic acid is endoergonic (ΔG ¼
+33 kJ mol1) because of the strong entropic contribution (Table 4.1).
Conversely, if the reaction is carried out in a condensed medium such as water,
despite the latter causing multiple equilibria with formation of CO2 hydrated forms
(4.4) in addition to the forms of dissociated formic acid (4.5), or if a base (ammonia
or other bases) is used that produces formate salts instead of free formic acid, the
thermodynamics of the process is favored (ΔG ¼ 4 kJ mol1 for (4.6a) and (4.6b)
and ΔG ¼ 35 kJ mol1 for (4.7), respectively) [16–21].

Interestingly, the hydrogenation of HCO3

(4.6b) is exoergonic (ΔG ¼ 0.72 kJ mol1and ΔH ¼ 20.5 kJ mol1)

As mentioned above, the spontaneous release of formic acid from the catalyst
(Scheme 4.4) does not take place for kinetic and thermodynamic reasons under
neutral or basic conditions, as 20–80 kJ mol1 indicates that the process is not
thermodynamically favoured. Moreover, breaking of the M–O and M–H bonds can
represent the real kinetic barrier to the process.
This has for a long time prevented the exploitation of such reaction as a catalytic
direct route to free HCO2H. In fact, either the ammonium- or the Group 1 metal
formate were produced which need treatment with inorganic acids (such as H2SO4)
for the production of the free acid (4.8).

Such acid treatment produces equimolar (to HCO2H) amounts of waste inorganic
salts. Very recent reports are quite encouraging about the possible exploitation of
the direct synthesis of free formic acid. In fact, Lawrenczy has shown that it is
possible to produce free formic acid by carrying out the reaction in acidic media
(in water or DMSO). Although limited to tests carried out directly in NMR tubes,
1.9 M formic acid has been detected in DMSO (0.2 M in water) using RuCl2(1,3,5-
triaz-7-phosphaadamantane) and other related ligands [23]. This ﬁnding represents
a breakthrough in this ﬁeld and can open the way to exploitation of the reaction. The
conversion yield is inﬂuenced by the temperature over the range 303–363 K. At the
latter temperature the yield is halved with respect to that at 303 K.
Much less is known about the “abnormal insertion” path bearing to the
metallacarboxylic species (2) for which only a few claims exist. Nevertheless, the
M–C(O)OH moiety can be stable and is easily formed upon reaction of a metal
carbonyl species M(CO) with a hydroxo anion (OH) (4.9) or by protonation of
co-ordinated CO2 (4.10 and 4.11) or by insertion of CO2 in the M–H bond
(Scheme 4.1). The formation of Ni–C(O)OH via proton attack at the oxygen of a
coordinated η2(C,O)–CO2 has been reported for the reaction of Ni(PCy3)2(CO2)
with PhSH [24]. The resulting Ni–CO2H moiety undergoes further protonation with

reported that the η1(C)–CO2 Ru(diphos)2(CO2) can be protonated to afford the

Dubois et al. [26] have proposed the formation of a Pd–CO2H species as inter-
mediate in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 catalyzed by a Pd complex.
However, despite the M–COOH species being proposed to be present and active
in several processes implying H-species and CO2, a clear-cut demonstration of CO2
insertion into the M–H bond of a transition metal complex to afford M–CO2H is not
found in the literature. Consequently, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd any demonstration of the
reaction mechanism or the energies and geometries of TSs. Conversely, some
thermodynamic and kinetic observations have been reported for the reverse reaction
(4.12), which is for the conversion of the Ru(bpy)2(CO)(COOH)+ species, [27]
generated through the attack of a hydroxo anion on a carbonyl moiety linked to Ru
in the complex Ru(bpy)2(CO)2
2+, into the hydride Ru–complex LnRu–H and CO2.
For such a kind of reaction it has been found that basic ancillary ligands favor the
CO2-elimination process.

This implies that ligands with poor basicity or good Lewis acidity should favor the
“abnormal” insertion process, which is in agreement with what was discussed
above. The metallacarboxylic species M–CO2H is

an intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO via “e + H+” transfer. Two paths
have been proposed for such “e + H+” transfer, as shown in Scheme 4.5: the
protonation at the –OH group bound to C (Scheme 4.5a) [24, 25] and the proton-
ation at the C¼O of the carboxylic moiety [28] bearing to the formation of a metal-
dihydroxycarbene analogous to similar species proposed as intermediates in
Fisher–Tropsch processes (Scheme 4.5b). This point still requires clariﬁcation.
The conversion of M–CO2H moieties does not always goes towards CO2
elimination and M–H formation. Scheme 4.6 shows the case of a Pd–CO2H
complex which formally eliminates HCO2H (better H2O and CO) undergoing
dimerization to afford a μ2-η2-complex (see Sect. 2.5) with the CO2 molecule
bridging two Pd atoms, i.e., being bound via C to one Pd and via O to the second
one. The reaction is reported to be reversible [29].
More details about the reactivity of the M–H:CO2 system can be found in
Chap. 8, where the electrochemical, photochemical, and electrophotochemical
reduction of CO2 in water is discussed.
4.2
CO2 Insertion into M–OH Bonds
The insertion of CO2 into discrete covalent polar M–OH bonds has long been
investigated because as the reaction is related to the conversion of CO2 into its
hydrated forms (anionic or coordinated HCO3
 and the elusive acid H2CO3 which
cannot be isolated as a pure compound), a reaction that plays a key role in CO2
elimination in humans and animals in the respiratory process. Such a reaction is
relevant to the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) which accelerates the reaction of
hydration–dehydration of CO2, thus facilitating its uptake at the cellular level and
its elimination in the lungs from where it is expelled [30]. Scheme 4.7 shows the
mechanism of reaction of CO2 with the Zn–OH moiety, active center of CA.
The insertion process is pH dependent: for CA at pH 7 it is a second-order
process, the rate constant for step 3 in Scheme 4.7 being estimated to be
kcat∕KM  1.1  105 to 1.6  108 M1 s1. Such a value increases if the pH is
increased. The above kcat∕KM value must be compared with those commonly
found for the interaction of transition metal systems LnM–OH with CO2 (45–
590 M1 s1) [31], with the value reported for OH in basic solutions
(7.9  103 M1 s1) [32] and with that reported for [Ni(cyclen)(OH)]+
(3.3  103 M1 s1) [33], a complex with unusual performance. The enzymatic
system is, thus, several orders of

The complex is reported to be strictly monomeric as the steric hindrance of the
ligand prevents any association in solution. The reaction is ﬁrst order in [CO2] as
shown in Fig. 4.1. It is also ﬁrst order in [Ni] so that the overall second order is
obtained as shown in (4.13):

reversible insertion of CO2 into the Ir–OH bond. Very recently, Ir–hydroxo com-
plexes bearing the imidazolium carbene ligand have been synthesized [36] which at
the solid state insert CO2 into the Ir–OH bond with fast intermolecular water
elimination and dimerization, without isolation of the mono-hydrogen carbonate
complex (Scheme 4.9). The spontaneous dehydration is found in other systems.
For example, dihydroxo metal complexes may undergo CO2 insertion [37] with
formation of either mono- or dihydrogencarbonate derivatives: the former have not
been isolated as they further react, according to the temperature, to either afford the
latter or a carbonato species via intramolecular water elimination, as shown in
Scheme 4.10.
The chemistry of hydroxo species is quite rich and of interest as it is relevant to
several reactive systems in which (transition) metals–H2O and CO2 are present.
This is, for example, the case of methane dry reforming or CO2-mediated dehydro-
genation of HCs or syngas utilization or other similar high temperature processes as
those described in Chap. 7.

CO2 Insertion into M–C Bonds
In this chapter the elementary reaction of CO2 with a discrete M–C bond is
discussed. The coupling of CO2 with unsaturated hydrocarbons, which may also
imply insertion of CO2 into an M–C bond, is discussed in Chap. 5. The insertion–
deinsertion of CO2 into M–R bonds (R ¼ alkyl or aryl moiety) is relevant to
carboxylation–decarboxylation processes which are very important in biological
systems [38]. In this case, as seen for the insertion into M–H bonds, two mecha-
nisms are possible, as depicted in Scheme 4.11.
What was discussed for the M–H bond may hold here too. In fact, the M–C bond
is polar with the same formal charge separation observed in the M–H bond.
Therefore, the normal mode of insertion would be considered the one that bears
to species (8) in Scheme 4.11. The nature of the metal and its electronic structure-
oxidation state may inﬂuence the insertion path. Metals in a high oxidation state
would favor the formation of 8 in Scheme 4.11, whereas lower oxidation state metal
centers might favor the production of 9, also depending on the ancillary ligands.
Both metal–alkyl and metal–aryl bonds undergo such insertion reactions, although
different reactivities are observed. Early studies on the reaction of M–R systems
with CO2 were reported by Volpin et al. [39]. Interestingly, they demonstrated that
Ti(IV) inserts CO2 into the Ti–CH3 bond of Cp2Ti(CH3)2 affording only the metalla
ester Cp2Ti(O2C–CH3)2, whereas Co(I) was able to insert CO2 into the Co–C2H5
bond of (PPh3)2(CO)CoC2H5, affording both the LnCo–CO2C2H5 and the
LnCoO2C–C2H5 forms. The acidolysis of the Co-complexes afforded propionic
acid, C2H5COOH, from the former complex and ethyl formate, HCO2C2H5, from
the latter, conﬁrming the two different modes of insertion.
The complex (diphos)Rh-phenyl [40], generated from (diphos)Rh(η6-BPh4),
was shown to undergo facile insertion of CO2 into the Rh-phenyl bond to afford
the benzoato complex (diphos)Rh(O2C–C6H5), following the normal insertion
route (8, Scheme 4.11).
Of interest are systems in which both M–H and M–C bonds are present as they
offer the possibility of comparing the relative rates and mechanisms. A study on one
of such systems, namely on trans-Ru(dmpe)2(H)CH3, has been reported by Field
and coworkers, who have shown that [41] the Ru-formate obtained by insertion of
CO2 into the Ru–H bond is the kinetic product. Such reaction also occurs instan-
taneously at 273 K. Conversely, the insertion of CO2 into the Ru–CH3 bond occurs
only at 333 K, a temperature at which the formate is decomposed. However, either
the formate or the acetate can be isolated. The easy reversibility of the CO2
insertion into the Ru–H bond is in agreement with the catalytic properties of Ru
(II) complexes which are quite good catalysts in the formation of HCO2H from CO2
and H2 [19] in both basic [42] and acid media [43], affording the formate anion and
free formic acid (see above), respectively. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the
CO2 reaction with M–H and M–CH3 bonds in the complex trans-Ru(dmpe)2(H)
CH3 has been recently investigated [43]. The authors have conﬁrmed the order of
reactivity Ru–H  Ru–CH3, and have shown that, although the insertion into the
4.3
CO2 Insertion into M–C Bonds
95
Ru–H bond readily occurs at 273 K or even lower, the insertion into the Ru–CH3
bond has well deﬁned activation parameters, namely: ΔH# ¼ 12.7 	 0.6 kcal/mol
and ΔS# ¼ 31.9 	 2.0 J mol1 K1, inferring a well deﬁned and ordered transition
state. Such ﬁndings are important as they conﬁrm that the reaction occurs at the
metal center driven by co-ordination and exclude a dissociative pathway. The
reactions were monitored by using in situ IR and 1H-NMR techniques. A compu-
tational study was also carried out which provided precious information on the
trans-effect of a ligand on the insertion rate. So if –CH3 was substituted with –Cl in
the trans-Ru(dmpe)2CH3(X) complex (X ¼ H, CH3), the insertion of CO2 into the
Ru–H bond, so facile in trans-Ru(dmpe)2(H)CH3, was not observed, also under
forcing conditions (1.3 MPa CO2): the trans-labilizing effect of the CH3 moiety has
an important role in fastening the insertion reaction into the trans-Ru–H bond. This
trend was conﬁrmed by studying the reactivity towards CO2 of the dimethyl
complex trans-Ru(dmpe)2(CH3)2. A double consecutive insertion has been
observed [38] bearing to the mono- and di-acetato complexes trans-Ru
(dmpe)2(O2C–CH3)CH3 and trans-Ru(dmpe)2(O2C–CH3)2, respectively. Both
insertions are exothermic (28 and 21 kcal mol1, for the ﬁrst and second
steps, respectively), with the second insertion being two orders of magnitude slower
than the ﬁrst one at ca. 300 K [43]. The ﬁrst insertion beneﬁts from the strong trans-
effect of the methyl moiety, whereas in the second insertion the formate moiety is
trans to Ru–CH3, making the insertion less favored. The reaction rate was shown to
be second order overall (4.17) and dependent on the PCO2. More precisely, as the
[CO2] was four times higher than that of [Ru] at PCO2 ¼ 0.1 MPa, an apparent rate
ﬁrst order in [Ru] was determined (4.15). However, being that the concentration of
CO2 in solution is dependent on its gas phase pressure PCO2,

and kobs having been found to be directly proportional to the [CO2] in solution
(4.16), the overall second order (4.17) results.
Computational studies on the Ru-complexes have conﬁrmed that ancillary
ligands with different basicity play a key role in fastening-slowing down the
reaction rate; the following order has been calculated: tmeda > dmpe > dppe. The
role of the metal has also been highlighted, showing that the analogous Fe–H and
Fe–CH3 complexes are kinetically and thermodynamically more active that the
Ru-complexes, conﬁrming that ﬁrst row transition metals are better catalysts than
the analogous second row.

CO2 Insertion into M–OR Bonds
The reaction of CO2 with M–OR (R ¼ alkyl, aryl) bonds is of industrial interest as it
is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates
based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohol, polyols, and
epoxides. In this paragraph the kinetics and thermodynamics of the elementary
step (4.18) are discussed, and the synthesis of organic carbonates (acyclic and
cyclic) is discussed in Chap. 6.
Because of the well deﬁned polarity of the M–O bond, there is no ambiguity
about the mode of insertion of CO2. The electrophilic carbon of the heterocumulene
is attacked by the electron-rich terminal of the polar Mδ+–Oδ bond. Therefore, the
insertion product is a metal-alkylcarbonate complex (4.18).

ð4:18Þ
The parameters which govern the insertion of CO2 into the M–OR bond are
inﬂuenced by all the factors which may determine the polarity and the energy of
the M–O bond, namely, the nature of the metal, its oxidation state, the ancillary
ligands L, and the nature of R. In general, early transition metals, high oxidation
states, and basic ancillary ligands favor the reaction. M–O–alkyl moieties are more
reactive than M–O–aryl groups, because of the σ-donor character of the alkyl
groups. A variety of metal complexes have been investigated, which have also
been tested as catalysts in synthetic chemistry and copolymerization processes [44–
61]. Despite such a wide availability of chemical information, mechanistic studies
centered on the reaction of CO2 with the M–OR systems are not very abundant.
Early studies [62] propose that the TS of such a reaction can be represented as in
Structure 4.2 and implies the interaction of the weak electrophilic C of CO2 with the
oxygen of the OR group. Such representation has also been considered valid for
other CO2-like cumulenes such as CS2 and COS [63], and suggests that preliminary
coordination of CO2 to a metal center is unnecessary in this class of reaction, as in
other insertion reactions considered above.
A well studied case of insertion of CO2 into the M–OR bond is represented by
the insertion of CO2 into the M–OCH3 bond of the complex fac-(CO)3(dppe)Mn
(OCH3) to afford fac-(CO)3(dppe)Mn–OC(O)OCH3, a complex with scarce appli-
cation as a copolymerization catalyst. Kinetic and mechanistic studies have been
aimed at the deﬁnition of the TS and kinetic parameters [64]. Such reaction was
reported to be very fast already at 195 K [65, 66]. Darensbourg and coworkers have
used low temperature in situ IR for their studies. Despite the difﬁculty linked to the
experimental conditions, they were able to determine at 195 K the value of
2.0  103 M1 s1 for the rate constant k1 for the second-order reaction (4.19).
The authors say that such a value is most likely underestimated.

parameters
as
being
ΔH# ¼ 130 	 4.0 kJ mol1 and ΔS# ¼ 121.6 	 11.9 J mol1 K1. From the above
values the authors have calculated an approximate value of the equilibrium constant
for the carboxylation reaction equal to 3  1013 M1 at 195 K (or a ΔG value for the
same reaction of < 50 kJ mol1), showing that the insertion of CO2 into the M–O–
alkyl bond is both kinetically and thermodynamically very favored. This trend has
also been conﬁrmed for the insertion of CO2 into the Nb–OR bond in [Nb(OR)5]2
(R ¼ methyl, ethyl, allyl) (see Sect. 6.2.2.1), a catalyst for the synthesis of dialkyl
carbonates [67]. Very recently, the facile insertion of CO2 into metal–phenoxide
bonds has been reported [68] for cobalt and zinc complexes (Fig. 4.2). It should be
noted that such metal systems are used as catalysts in the copolymerization of CO2
with epoxides.

Insertion into M–O2 Bonds
The reaction of a CO2–metal system LnM(CO2) with O2 or of a dioxygen complex
of a transition metal LnM(O2) with CO2 may lead to the formation of
peroxocarbonates (Scheme 4.12).

Scheme 4.13 Possible pathways to transition metal peroxocarbonates from dioxygen-metal-
complexes and CO2 (adapted from [73])
The reaction, known for a long time, is the one implying the addition of CO2 to a
dioxygen–metal-complex [69–72]. Nevertheless, very little was known about the
reaction mechanism. Only recently have studies been carried out to shed light on
the reaction of dioxygen complexes with CO2 [73–75] or of carbon dioxide
complexes with O2 [76]. Two ways are possible, which imply the O–O
(Scheme 4.13, routes 1a, 2a) or M–O bond opening (Scheme 4.13, routes 1b, 2b)
with subsequent CO2 insertion and ring closure to afford the peroxocarbonate
structure.
Aresta’s group investigated the formation of Rh(III)-peroxocarbonates RhCl
(CO4)P3 (P ¼ PEt2Ph, PEtPh2) from RhCl(η2-O2)P3 and CO2, making extensive
use of labeled compounds (16O2,18O2, C16O2, C18O2) [73, 74].
Remarkably, reactions A and B in Scheme 4.14 afforded, respectively,
isotopomers II and IV, instead of III and V. These results showed unambiguously
that, in the speciﬁc case under study, the formation of the peroxocarbonate moiety
did not proceed through the insertion of CO2 into the metal–oxygen bond of the
parent dioxygen complex, but implied O–O bond cleavage and CO2 insertion. This
conclusion was further supported by a modeling study, using the impulse oscillation
model (IOM)
100

Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
Scheme 4.14 Possible peroxocarbonate isotopomers from reactions A and B (adapted from [73])
developed by Borowiak and coworkers [75]. Such a mechanism is justiﬁed by the
fact that the splitting of the O–O bond requires less energy (36 kcal mol1) than the
cleavage of the M–O bond (ca. 65–90 kcal mol1) [76]. Most likely, the above
reaction pathway is more general and widespread than can be imagined. The
reactions of O2 with CO2-adducts of transition metals, both in the solid state and
in solution, to give peroxocarbonate metal complexes, have long been regarded as
examples of oxidative coupling reactions proceeding through the insertion of
dioxygen into the M–C bond of the coordinated CO2 ligand.

Recently, the solid state reaction of the carbon dioxide Ni–complex (PCy3)2Ni
(CO2) with dioxygen to afford peroxocarbonate (PCy3)2Ni(CO4) has been
re-examined in order to ascertain whether dioxygen was really able to insert into
the Ni–C bond of (PCy3)2Ni(CO2) [75, 77]. Complex (PCy3)2Ni(CO2) was reacted
with O2 using the following isotopic species: 12C16O2, 13C16O2, 12C18O2, 16O2,
18O2. The ﬁrst important evidence was that, when (PCy3)2Ni(CO2), or its labeled
analogues 13CO2 or C18O2, was reacted with O2 (16O2 or 18O2), the FTIR spectrum
of the gas phase showed immediately the appearance of CO2 (or its labeled
analogues), which then disappeared with time. This suggested reaction (4.20) as
the ﬁrst step of the solid-state reaction.

mode analysis of (PCy3)2Ni(CO4) and its isotopologues, substantiated that the
overall reaction takes place through a carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen
coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the O–O bond of the newly formed,
reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex. The results of this study show that the formation
of the peroxo-moiety requires an activated dioxygen molecule that interacts with
carbon dioxide in an intermolecular mode. The incoming hetero-cumulene attacks
one oxygen of the co-ordinated O2 and this causes the O–O bond splitting, rather
than the Ni–O bond cleavage.

CO2 Insertion into M–N Bonds
Numerous examples of carbon dioxide insertion into the M–N bond of transition
metal amides [78–84] are described in the literature. In comparison, however,
mechanistic studies in this area are relatively few.

Insertion into Transition Metal Amides

was believed, at ﬁrst, to take place through a mechanism analogous to the insertion
of unsaturated hydrocarbons into M–C(alkyl) bonds [85]. Later, it was ascertained
[86], at least for the reactions of W(NMe2)6 and W2(NEt2)4Me2 with CO2, to give,
respectively, W(NMe2)3(O2CNMe2)3 and W2(O2CNEt2)4Me2, that the insertion
reaction can proceed through an amine-catalyzed mechanism ((4.22a) and (4.23)).
Trace amounts of amine can be fortuitously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n
compounds as a result of M(NMe2)n hydrolysis produced by adventitious water.
Under the working conditions (CO2 excess relative to amine), free amine can
interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2NCO2H, which reacts
as shown in (4.23). According to this mechanism, the formation of the metal
carbamate complex should be better regarded as a ligand substitution rather than
a true insertion process.

As shown in Scheme 4.15, this reaction pathway has been largely exploited from
the synthetic point of view for the preparation of a great number of metal carbamate
adducts [78–84].
Energetics of (4.22a) seems to depend markedly on the substituents on the N
atom [88–95]. Gaseous carbamic acid H2NC(O)OH has been reported to be un-
stable [82, 88] with respect to NH3(g) and CO2(g) (ΔHr ¼ 58 kJ/mol;
ΔGr ¼ 93 kJ/mol [82]). However, theoretical calculations show that in
other cases, wherein R 6¼ H, reaction (4.22a) may be close to thermoneutral or
may exhibit negative reaction

Scheme 4.15 Preparation of carbamate adducts by ligand substitution
heats [89–92]. Accordingly, carbamic acid formation (4.22a) is an equilibrium
process. By using a number of spectroscopic techniques, carbamic acids have
been detected in solution at concentrations that depend on the experimental condi-
tions: nature of solvent, temperature, CO2 pressure, CO2/amine molar ratio [96–
103]. High [CO2]/[amine] ratios favor acid with respect to carbamate salt, which,
however, predominates in the presence of excess of amine (4.24). Monomeric acid,
R2NCO2H, can be stabilized upon self-association to form a dimer, (R2NCO2H)2
[104–108], which is expected to be a

less reactive species than the monomeric form. H-bonded dimeric carbamic acids
(R2NCO2H)2 have been detected in solution (R ¼ benzyl) [108] and, depending on
the nature of R substituents and the experimental conditions, have also been
isolated
and
structurally
characterized
[104,
105].
The
isolated
dimer
[(PhCH2)2NCO2H]2 forms from benzylamine and CO2 through the intermediacy
of (R2NH2)(O2CNR2) (R ¼ PhCH2), after prolonged exposure of the carbamate salt
to CO2 [105]. Plausibly, under the working conditions, proton transfer between
dialkylammonium cation and carbamate anion gives the amine (PhCH2)2NH and
the monomer acid (PhCH2)2NCO2H may be the initial step towards the formation
of the dimer. However, when CO2 is in excess relative to amine (see above), a
different mechanism cannot be excluded. By assuming a 1:1 CO2/RNH2 reaction
model, it was calculated that formation of the relevant monomer acid RNHCO2H is
an asynchronous process involving a four-membered ring transition state where an
N–C bond is formed and one proton is transferred [89–91]. This reaction pathway
can be roughly assimilated to a CO2 insertion into the NH bond of an amine. The
calculated energy barriers, which are markedly affected by the used calculation
method, were relatively high (45–70 kcal/mol, RNH2 ¼ methylamine, methylurea),
showing that formation of carbamic acid by CO2 insertion into the NH bond of the
amine is not an easy process. Borowiak and coworkers [93] modeled, using the ab
initio RHF/3-21G method, the reaction of CO2 with dimethylamine in the presence
of a second dimethylamine molecule. Starting from the most stable 1:2 CO2/R2NH
complex [93, 94] they found that the reaction product is a cyclic H-bonded complex
of dimethylcarbamic acid with dimethylamine. Remarkably, a signiﬁcantly lower
activation energy (9.54 kcal/mol) was calculated for this reaction pathway. Ana-
logous calculations showed that the reaction of CO2 with two ammonia molecules
affords an H-bonded H2NCO2HNH3 adduct analogous to that found for the 1:2
CO2/R2NH system [95]. However, the estimated energy barrier was, in this case,
higher (29 kcal/mol).
In general, M(NMe2)n–m(O2CNMe2)m adducts are labile with respect to CO2
exchange (4.25). The activation energy required for the exchange process was
estimated by VT-1HNMR

anion that, under the working conditions (excess of CO2 relative to free amine), was
expected to be present in the reaction system at very low concentration.

The aptitude of metal–amides and metal–carbamates to hydrolyze in the presence of
adventitious water, as well as the occurrence of (4.22a), are major caveats in studying
the mechanistic aspects of this insertion reaction [109] and the mechanism summarized
by (4.22a) and (4.23) may also be working in other cases. However, CO2 attack on
metal bonded nitrogen is also possible and has been documented experimentally.
Roundhill and coworkers [110] described the formation of N-bonded carbamate
trans-Pt(Ph)(NHCO2H)(PCy3)2 from the reaction of trans-Pt(Ph)(NH2)(PCy3)2 and
carbon dioxide. The N-bonded carbamate complex can be easily isolated, as it is
precipitated in benzene solvent. When this species was dissolved in dichloro-
methane, isomerization to the O-bonded complex trans-Pt(Ph)(OCONH2)(PCy3)2
took place. The O-bonded isomer can be obtained in a single step by reacting trans-
Pt(Ph)(NH2)(PCy3)2 with CO2 in CH2Cl2. In the latter case, the N-isomer trans-Pt

NHC6H4) (10) with CO2 to give the M–N insertion product (Me3P)4Ru(η2-OC(O)

Scheme 4.17 Insertion of CO2 into the Ru–N bond of (Me3P)4Ru(η2-NHC6H4) (adapted from
[109])
mechanistic pathway for reaction (4.29), as supported by NMR investigations in
which extended use of labeled derivatives (13CO2, (Me3P)4Ru(η2-15NHC6H4) was
made. The reaction proceeds via attack of CO2 on the nitrogen atom of 10 to give
intermediates A and B (Scheme 4.17), which were detected spectroscopically when
the reaction was carried out at low temperature. Remarkably, when the reaction was
carried out at 273 K in the presence of PMe3-d9, the formation of A and B, as well as
the conversion of these intermediates into product 11, occurred without any
exchange of free deuterated phosphine with coordinated undeuterated phosphine,
showing that the insertion of CO2 must occur without dissociation of PMe3 ligands.
This result is consistent with the direct attack of CO2 at the nitrogen atom of 10 to
form A and B (Scheme 4.17) and demonstrates that a preliminary coordination of
CO2 to the metal center is not a prerequisite for the insertion reaction to occur.
Therefore, the insertion reaction of CO2 into the metal–nitrogen bond of the ortho-
metalated anilide 10 proceeds through a pathway different from the classical
coordination/migration mechanism operating for the metal–carbon bond insertion
reactions. Further investigations have shown that the insertion into the M–N bond is
the kinetically preferred pathway. In fact, upon heating at 393 K, 11 did not convert
into the N,O-bonded anthranilate complex (Me3P)4Ru(η2-OC(O)C6H4NH) 12, the
product of formal insertion of CO2 into the metal–carbon bond of 10, but rearranged
to carboxyamide complex (Me3P)4Ru(η2-N(Ph)C(O)O) 13. Moreover, upon
heating, (Me3P)4Ru(η2-OC(O)C6H4NH) 12, prepared by an independent route,
did not convert into 11, but afforded the O,C-bound anthranilate complex
(Me3P)4Ru(η2-OC(O)C6H3NH2) 14 (Scheme 4.18).
An important issue is the regioselectivity of the insertion reaction in those cases
where more than one reaction site is available for carbon dioxide insertion or, more
generally, for reaction with the heterocumulene. Cowan and Trogler [112] found
that trans-Pt(H)(NHPh)(PCy3)2 reacted reversibly with CO2 to give a carbamate
rather than a formate or metallo-acid complex. Other studies have established that
106
4
Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
metal–amide bonds were more reactive towards CO2 insertion than metal–alkyl or
metal–alkoxo bonds [110, 111, 113, 114]. Nevertheless, the η5-cyclopentadienyl
silyl-η-amide zirconium dimethyl complex [η5-C5H4SiMe2(NtBu)]ZrMe2 inserted
CO2 regioselectively into the Zr–Me bonds [115]. The metal–amide bond seems to
be more reactive than the metal–imido bond [116, 117]. DFT studies on the reaction
of [W(NPh)(N2Npy)Me]+ (N2Npy¼MeC(2-C5H4N)(CH2NSiMe3)2) with carbon
dioxide showed that CO2 insertion into the W–Me bond is thermodynamically
preferred, but that insertion into W–Namide is kinetically more facile [117]. Cyclo-
addition of CO2 to the W¼NPh imido bond was neither kinetically nor thermody-
namically viable.
However, CO2 can react with metal–imido bonds through a [2+2] cycloaddition
reaction to give N,O-bound metal carbamates [118]. The latter species can react
further and either extrude the corresponding isocyanate with formation of a metal–
oxo complex [83, 119] or also insert a second CO2

favored over isocyanate extrusion, and that the rates of the two processes are similar
[119]. Calculations on Ti(η-C5R5)(NtBu){MeC(NiPr)2} (R ¼ H or Me) showed that
increasing the steric bulk increases the thermodynamic favorability of the isocya-
nate extrusion process and signiﬁcantly raises the activation barrier for the second
CO2 insertion, making the latter process impossible.
4.6.2
Insertion into Main Group and Post-Transition Metal
Amides
Carbon dioxide has been recognized for a long time to insert formally into the
metal–nitrogen bond of amides of main group and post-transition metals [78–84,
120–130]. Nevertheless, experimental studies aimed at shedding light on the
pathway of these carbamation reactions are scarce. For the reasons mentioned
above, this is by no means an easy matter, which is made more complicated by
the fact that the reactant amide is often involved in aggregation/disaggregation as
well as solvation processes.
In early work, Inoue and Yokoo [121] found that carbon dioxide insertion into
the Al–N bond of Et2Al–NEt2 was accelerated by tertiary amines such as, for
instance, 1-methyl-imidazole, N-methylbenzimidazole, or pyridine. The role of
the base was explained by taking into account that

Scheme 4.19 Mechanism of formation of lithium carbamate 16
diethyl aluminum diethylamide exists in a dimeric form with Al–N–Al bridges. In
the presence of some complexing agent a monomeric complex can form, in which
108

Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
the nucleophilicity of the N atom, freed from the bridge, is enhanced. Based on this,
the authors speculated that the metal bound amidic nitrogen should be more prone
to attack from CO2 with formation of carbamate moiety.
A picture of the mechanistic features characterizing the insertion reactions of
carbon dioxide in a few of these systems has been provided by means of compu-
tational studies.
Nilsson Lill et al. [131] have modeled the mechanism of formation of lithium
carbamate 16 (4.30) from chiral lithium amide (S)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)
pyrrolidide (15) and CO2 by using detailed DFT calculations. The selected chiral
lithium amide 15 can exist as a mixture of THF solvated and unsolvated dimers, in
which the second pyrrolidine ring acts as an intramolecular ligand and, therefore,
symmetrical (see 17 in Scheme 4.19) and unsymmetrical (where one Li atom is
intramolecularly tetracoordinated and the other Li is dicoordinated) dimers of 15
were taken into account. On the energetically preferred reaction pathway amide 15
exists predominantly as a (solvated) symmetrical dimer 17. Attack by CO2 takes
place in an “end-on” manner to give several heterodimers 18 which are composed
of a lithium amide and a lithium carbamate. This exergonic step is rate-determining,
and the activation barrier was found to be about 10 kcal/mol. Interestingly, it was
found that the transition states without solvent coordination to lithium cation were
more stable than those containing coordinated solvent molecules. Addition of a
second carbon dioxide molecule to heterodimers 18 then leads, through a new
encounter-complex, to several almost isoenergetic homodimers 19 of lithium car-
bamate 16. This strongly exergonic insertion reaction has a barrier of 9.7 kcal/mol.
The mechanism of CO2 ﬁxation by alkylmagnesium amides and magnesium
bisamides has been analyzed by Himmel [132] with the aid of quantum chemical
calculations relying on pure DFT (BP86)

Scheme 4.20 Mechanism of formation of carbamates in dimeric alkylzinc amides
as well as hybrid-DFT(B3LYP) methods. In agreement with the body of experi-
mental results, the calculations showed that magnesium amides prefer the dimeric
over the monomeric form. In the dimeric form the two Mg atoms are bridged by two
amido ligands. The presence of chelating ligands, such as ethylenediamine (EDA)
which preferentially binds to monomer, shifts the equilibrium to the monomer side.
According to the calculations, insertion of CO2 into the Mg–N bond of monomeric
alkylmagnesium amides and magnesium bisamides forms a [MgOCN] four-
membered cyclic intermediate without any signiﬁcant reaction barrier. Formation
of the carbamate product from the latter species exhibits a relatively small barrier
4.6
CO2 Insertion into M–N Bonds
109
(ΔG ¼ +33 kJ/mol for H3CMgN(CH3)2 and +48 kJ/mol for Mg[N(CH3)2]2) to be
overcome. Monomeric complexes with chelating donor molecules such as EDA
react with CO2, affording the carbamate product without any barrier and any
intermediate. However, in the case of CO2 insertion into one of the Mg–N bonds
of dimeric alkylmagnesium amides, a signiﬁcant barrier (ΔG ¼ +78 kJ/mol) has to
be surmounted, which is associated with a transition state featuring a four-
membered MgOCN ring.
Analogous studies [133] have also been carried out for the insertion of CO2 in
the Zn–N bond of zinc amides, which usually results in the formation of tetra-
nuclear zinc–carbamate adducts [128–130]. Similar to what was found for mono-
meric alkylmagnesium amides, a four-membered cyclic [ZnNCO] intermediate is
ﬁrst obtained from the reaction of monomeric alkylzinc amides with CO2. The
activation energy ΔG of this ﬁrst, rate-determining, step is around +60 kJ/mol.
From this local minimum on the potential energy surface, the system has to
overcome a much smaller barrier to convert into the monomeric carbamate product,
which can then undergo dimerization and tetramerization (both showing negative
ΔG values). The energetics of the CO2 ﬁxation reaction by different zinc amides of
formula RZnNR0R00 were found to be very sensitive to changes in the electronic
properties of the amido group, whereas modiﬁcations on the alkyl (R) side had
almost no inﬂuence. Calculations indicated that the reaction of dimeric alkylzinc
amides with CO2 showed a larger barrier (ΔG value more than +100 kJ/mol)
connected with a transition state featuring a four-membered [ZnNCO] cycle
(Scheme 4.20), which evolves into a six-membered cyclic intermediate. The barrier
separating the latter intermediate from the product is very small. The calculations
also showed that the barrier for CO2 ﬁxation by dimeric alkylzinc amides was
higher than the energy required for decomposition of the dimer into two monomers.
It is also higher than the barrier for CO2 ﬁxation by monomeric alkylzinc amides
(60 kJ/mol). Therefore, it is plausible that, although dimeric alkylzinc amides are
preferred over monomers, the reaction with CO2 could mainly take place from the
monomeric state.
As already emphasized for transition metal carbamates, the O2C–N bond of the
carbamate moiety of these systems is somewhat labile, and the carbamate group
undergoes CO2 exchange processes easily.
Kinetics and reaction mechanism for CO2 exchange in 2-imidazolidinone-1-
carboxylic acid lithium salt (Li 20) were investigated by Lihs and Caudle [134]. N-
Carboxyimidazolidone anion, 20, was probed as an analogue for N1-carboxybiotin
and synthesized as the lithium salt by deprotonation of 2-imidazolidone 21 with
phenyllithium and further reaction of the resulting lithium amide with carbon
dioxide. The study was addressed to ascertain the viability of unimolecular CO2
elimination from

N1-carboxybiotin as a microscopic step in biotin-dependent carboxyl transfer
enzymes. Time-dependent FTIR spectroscopy and NMR measurements showed
that Li20 undergoes carboxyl exchange with free carbon dioxide, with kinetics
indicative of rate-limiting unimolecular dissociation of the NCO2 bond
(Scheme 4.21a). The Lewis acid Mg2+ catalyzed the CO2 exchange because of its
ability to coordinate to 20 (Scheme 4.21b), whereas the reaction of Li20 with
carboxylic acids in DMSO resulted in acid-dependent decarboxylation of 20
(Scheme 4.21c), with a rate which depended on the concentration and strength
(pKa) of the acid. Both Lewis acid-catalyzed carboxyl exchange and acid-
dependent

the carbonyl group of the ureido ring. These interactions act as a trigger for
dissociation of CO2 as they provoke polarization of the nitrogen lone pair toward
the imidazolidone ring rather than the carboxyl group and weaken the
NCO2
 bond.
Tetranuclear zinc carbamates Zn4O(O2CNR2)6 (NR2 ¼ N-diethylamino, N-
piperidyl, N-pyrrolidyl) (Scheme 4.22) were found, by transient FTIR spectroscopy
to undergo C–N bond metathesis reactions, resulting in the exchange of the
carboxyl group with CO2 and exchange of the amino group Am with bulk second-
ary amine [135]. The net rate for CO2 exchange was measured by monitoring the
uptake of 13CO2 and the concomitant release of 12CO2. The CO2 exchange kinetics
revealed a CO2-dependent (Scheme 4.22b) and a CO2-independent pathway
(Scheme 4.22a) for the CO2 exchange process.
The CO2-dependent process was rationalized in terms of pre-association of the
incoming CO2 with the complex prior to N–CO2 bond cleavage, whereas the CO2-
independent process was explained as caused by unimolecular elimination of CO2
from the complex. The transamination reaction, involving exchange of amino
groups, showed rates that were independent from the concentration and nature of
the incoming amine. Moreover, the average rates for transaminations were by a
factor of four higher than the CO2-independent CO2 exchange rate for the
corresponding complex. These data have been rationalized in terms of a common
rate-limiting process for CO2-independent CO2 exchange and transamination which
implies unimolecular elimination of CO2. In these systems the ligand exchange
dynamics was fast relative to the overall rate of C–N bond metathesis, thus showing
that the unimolecular CO2 exchange process cannot involve a rate-limiting dissoci-
ation of a carbamate ligand.
4.6.3
Insertion into Amides of Non-Metallic Elements
Carbon dioxide can also form carbamates by reaction with amides of non-metallic
elements [78–84, 136–144]. Most examples reported in the literature deal with
amides of silicon, germanium, and phosphorus. Among these, the insertion of the
heterocumulene into the P–N bond of hexaalkylphosphorus triamides P(NR2)3,
which affords phosphocarbamates species of formula P(NR2)3x(O2CNR2)x, has
received particular attention for its potential in chemical synthesis, because this
reaction opens a route to the phosgeneless synthesis of carbamate esters [138, 139]
and ureas [140].
Mechanistic information on the pathway of these insertion reactions are sparse.
A mechanism similar to that summarized by (4.22a) and (4.23), and involving the
intermediacy of carbamic acid formed by the action of CO2 on adventitious amine
present in the reaction medium, seems to be operative for the “formal” insertion of

amine were found to be essential in order that reaction (4.31) may proceed.
Moreover, Cavell and Griend [142] studied the reaction of CH3(CF3)3PN(CH3)2
with CO2 in the absence and in the presence of an amine trap. In the absence of any
amine trap, labeled 13CO2 was rapidly (15 min) incorporated in the carbamate
ligand of CH3(CF3)3PO2CN(CH3)2. However, in the presence of an amine trap,
such as Me3SiCl, no detectable incorporation of CO2 into the P–N bond of
CH3(CF3)3PN(CH3)2 occurred even over long times (5 days).
A bifunctional mechanism has been ascertained by means of IR and NMR
spectroscopic measurements for the insertion of CO2 into the P–N bond of
bicyclophosphorane 22 (8-phenyl-1,7-dioxa-4-aza-8-phospha(V) bicyclo[3.3.0]
octane) [143]. 1H, 31P, and 13C NMR spectroscopies showed that, under strictly
anhydrous conditions, CO2 interacts reversibly with 22 to give the intermediate
adduct 23, which is stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Intermediate 23
then undergoes irreversible insertion into the P–N bond to give the ﬁnal product 24,
which has been isolated and characterized (Scheme 4.23).

Scheme 4.24 CO2 insertion into the N–Si bond of (siam)2Ni (adapted from [144])
Walther and coworkers [144], by studying the reactivity of CO2 with (siam)2Ni
(25) (siam ¼ bistrimethylsilyl-benzamidinato, [(Me3SiN)2CPh]), observed, in the
ﬁnal product (siamCO2)3(siam(CO2)2)Ni2 (characterized by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction), the insertion of the heterocumulene into the N–Si bonds (Scheme 4.24).
They suggested that CO2 uptake by (siam)2Ni is the result of a stepwise reaction
starting with the insertion of CO2 into one Ni–N bond of 25 to form a carbamato-
type group (see A, Scheme 4.24). The next step would be the fast reaction of the
reactive N–Si group in the neighborhood of the activated CO2 with splitting of the
N–Si bond and formation a of a new Si–O–CO–N group (see B, Scheme 4.24). Ring
contraction of B results in the formation of a modiﬁed amidinato ligand which,
through an analogous pathway, is capable of inserting another molecule of CO2 into
the remaining N–Si bond.
CO2 insertion into the N–Si bond of silylamido ligands can play a key role in a
few metathetical reactions of carbon dioxide with bis-silyl-amido complexes M[N
(SiMe3)2]n (Na, n ¼ 2; Pr, Nd, n ¼ 3; Ge, Sn, n ¼ 2; Ti(IV), Zr(IV)) [82, 83]. These
metathetical reactions result in the oxo-transfer from CO2 to a silyl group of the
bis-silylamido ligand and provide an entry into silyl isocyanates or 1,3-bis(silyl)
carbodiimides (Scheme 4.25).
The mechanism through which the metathetical reaction is believed to occur
with M[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M ¼ Ge, Sn) amides is shown in Scheme 4.26 [145]. The
initial insertion step of the heterocumulene into the M–N bond is apparently
followed by a facile molecular

rearrangement which involves the elimination of an isocyanate fragment. Because
of the subvalent nature of the Group 14 metal center, it has been proposed that
carbamate ligand binds in a bidentate fashion. This mode of bonding might facili-
tate the 1,3-shift of a trimethylsilyl group by the enhancement of its electrophilic
character because of that of the carbamic carbon.
4.7
CO2 Insertion into M–P Bonds
Only a few examples of CO2 insertion into M–P bonds of metal-phosphido com-
plexes are known to date [146–149]. Carbon dioxide reacts selectively with the
(amino)(phosphanyl)alumane (tmp)2AlPR2 (tmp ¼ 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidino;
R ¼ SiMe3) to give (tmp)2AlO2CPR2, thus showing that insertion of the hetero-
cumulene into the Al–P bond of this substrate is preferred over the insertion into the
Al–N bond [146]. However, the reaction of 1,2-M2(NMe2)4(P(tBu)2)2 complexes

The reaction occurred rapidly at room temperature, both in solution and in the

in solution and attempts to grow good quality crystals afforded Mo2(O2CP

.2C6H6, a binuclear complex having a Mo–Mo quadruple bond supported
by a paddle-wheel arrangement of four phosphinecarboxylate ligands which span
the Mo–Mo bond [149]. The complex W2(O2CNMe2)2(O2CP(tBu)2)2(NMe2)2,
26b, was fully characterized by X-ray analysis, which conﬁrmed the presence of
a (W

species 26c0 and 26c00, having phosphinecarboxylate ligands bridging the (W

Low-temperature mechanistic studies have shown a kinetic preference for the
insertion of CO2 into metal–phosphido bonds as opposed to metal–amido bond and

CO2 Insertion into C–C Bonds
Formal insertion of CO2 into the carbon–carbon bond has been observed only in a
limited number of cases, dealing with strained cyclic hydrocarbons. Incorporation
of the heterocumulene into a C–C bond of these substrates is a potential synthetic
route to lactones, a class of products which ﬁnd interesting applications in pharma-
ceutical, cosmetics, and foodstuffs industry.
In the presence of electron-rich low-valent transition metal systems, strained
cyclic hydrocarbons can undergo ring opening and react with CO2 to afford
carboxylated products. The carboxylation reaction proceeds stoichiometrically
with Ni(0) systems [150, 151]. For instance, Ni(bpy)(cod) (bpy ¼ 2,20-bipyridine;
cod ¼ 1,4-cyclooctadiene) promoted the stoichiometric carboxylation of quadri-
cyclane, probably through the reaction sequence illustrated in Scheme 4.29
4.8
CO2 Insertion into C–C Bonds
117
[151]. One of the three-membered strained rings of quadricyclane opens through an
oxidative addition step to give a strained nickelacyclobutane containing Ni(II).
Further insertion of CO2 into a Ni–C σ bond yields a 2-oxa-3-nickelacyclohexanone
complex. However, the latter species, which was isolated, is much too stable (as can
also be inferred from the high decomposition point (517 K)) to release the
corresponding lactone in a subsequent reductive elimination step, and crystalline
endo-nortricyclane-3-carboxylic acid can be obtained only upon acid hydrolysis.
The proposed reaction pathway is in agreement with the rhodium- and nickel-
catalyzed ring-opening reactions of quadricyclane. The high strain energy of the
cyclic hydrocarbon (423 kJ/mol) seems to be crucial for the feasibility of the
carboxylation process. As a matter of fact, other cyclic three-membered hydrocar-
bons with a lower strain energy than quadricyclane, such as cyclopropane (118 kJ/
mol) and norcarane (127 kJ/mol), did not afford carboxylated products in the
presence of Ni(0). Most probably, because of their lower strain energy, the three-
membered rings of the latter substrates do not open to give the corresponding
nickelacyclobutane species.
Methylenecyclopropanes have been carboxylated with gaseous carbon dioxide
in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of nickel(0) complexes [150]. Depending
on the polarity of the reaction solvent and the nature of amine ligand (amidine or
guanidine base), several reactions pathways have been observed, which may
involve either oxidative coupling of CO2 with the C–C double bond of the substrate
(see Sect. 5.3) or opening of the three-membered ring and further reaction with the
heterocumulene.

mediate that, after CO2 uptake, evolves into butyrolactone. Formation of the car-
bonyl complex RhCl(CO)(PMe2Ph)2 corresponds to the deactivation of the catalyst.
The lactone was not produced thermally, probably because the reduction of CO2 to
CO with phosphine oxidation is favored by polar solvents and high temperatures.

Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
solventless conditions [156]. A key role in the catalyst-free process seems to be
played by zwitterionic adduct 29 (Scheme 4.32) [155]. This species, which can
form by coordination of CO2 to the aziridine substrate, may undergo ring opening
through nucleophilic attack by another similar molecule or aziridine itself [155,
156]. Final cyclization via intramolecular nucleophilic attack leads to the product as
well as to regeneration of 29 or the substrate. It is worth noting that adduct 29
cannot undergo a unimolecular reaction and attack the 3-position because this
would be a 5-endo-tet reaction, which is disfavored by Baldwin’s rules; moreover,
such a pathway would give net inversion, which is inconsistent with a few stereo-
chemical ﬁndings observed in dedicated experiments. In accordance with the
proposed mechanism, branched R2 substituents at the N atom, which make the
formation of adduct 29 more difﬁcult, lowered activity, as well as aryl or electron-
withdrawing groups (N-tosyl, for instance), which can reduce the electron density at
the N atom and hinder CO2 coordination. There exist two possible cycles (A or B)
in this catalytic cycle, depending on the nature of R1. When R1 is an aryl group,
cycle A is more favorable, leading to preferential formation of 30, whereas, if R1 is
alkyl, cycle B is predominant, thus resulting mainly in the generation of 31.

Scheme 4.33 LiBr-catalyzed carboxylation of N-tosylaziridines: proposed mechanism (adapted
from [161])
The cycloaddition reaction can be promoted by a variety of catalysts. Depending
on the used catalytic system, different typologies of mechanisms can be
categorized.
Alkali or tetraalkylammonium halides have been shown to be effective catalysts
for insertion of CO2 into the C–N bond of aziridines [157–163]. The role of halide
ion is crucial in these catalyzed processes as it acts not only as a nucleophile, thus
promoting ring opening of adduct 29, but also as a leaving group in the intra-
molecular cyclization step leading to cyclic carbamate. The mechanism of the
LiI-catalyzed cycloaddition of CO2 to aziridines has been modeled by means of
DFT calculations, which have shown that a complex, incorporating one molecule of
aziridine and a molecule of carbon dioxide together with Li+ and I, is formed
prior to the opening of the aziridine ring [160].
4.9
CO2 Insertion into C–N Bonds
121
A different mechanism (Scheme 4.33) has been proposed by Endo and
co-workers for the LiBr-catalyzed cycloaddition of CO2 to 2-substituted N-
tosylaziridines
[161].
This
reaction
afforded
selectively
the
4-substituted
regioisomer and was accelerated by electron-donating R substituents. In this case,
the ﬁrst step has been proposed to be a ring-opening reaction by nucleophilic attack
of bromide anion from the catalyst to give intermediate A (Scheme 4.33).
Regioselectivity of the opening reaction is responsible for regioselectivity observed
in the ﬁnal product. The fact that the reactivity of N-tosylaziridines was repressed
by electron-withdrawing groups rules out that this step might be the rate-
determining one. The next step is the reaction of anionic nitrogen with CO2 to
form intermediate B (Scheme 4.33), whose intramolecular cyclization gives the
product. This step is believed to be the rate-determining one, as it is expected to be
accelerated by electron-donating substituents through an inductive effect.
Activation of aziridine towards ring-opening can be promoted by Lewis acids
other than CO2 and capable of coordinating the substrate [164–166], or also by ¼
(R)N. . .HX (X ¼ N, O) hydrogen bond donors, such as polymer supported diol
functionalised ionic liquids or amino acids [167–169], which have been used as
catalysts. Scheme 4.34 illustrates the mechanism proposed by Miller and Nguyen
[164] for
the system (salen)chromium(III)/DMAP (salen ¼ N,N0-ethylenebis
(salicyliminate) dianion; DMAP ¼ 4-dimethylaminopyridine), which proved to be
an effective catalyst for the synthesis of 5-substituted oxazolidinones from carbon
dioxide and aziridines. The step of aziridine activation by coordination to the Lewis
acidic (salen)Cr metal center results in the formation of a partially cationic N atom
and is followed by the nucleophilic ring-opening of aziridine by the Lewis base
(LB) cocatalyst at the more substituted carbon to give an ionic intermediate. From
this intermediate, after CO2 uptake, the product was obtained. The presence of too
much LB repressed the reaction because of competitive coordination of LB to the
Lewis acidic Cr center. Moreover, the mechanism shown in Scheme 4.34 explains
the catalytic activity observed in the absence of cocatalyst, as aziridine itself is a LB
and can act as cocatalyst. An early report described the direct synthesis of
oxazolidin-2-ones (5–80% yield) from

process. Using 2-methylaziridine as the substrate, only 4-methyloxazolidin-2-one
was obtained, whereas 2-phenylaziridine converted into 5-phenyloxazolidin-2-one.
The different regioselectivity was rationalized assuming that, in the ﬁrst case, a
carbamic acid formed, which then attacked a second aziridine molecule, whereas,
in the other case, the formation of the 5-substituted regioisomer was ascribed to the
formation of a 1,3-dipolar intermediate.

CO2 Insertion into C–N Bonds

Cycloaddition of CO2 with N-substituted phenylaziridines can be promoted by
1,3-bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IPr) functionalized MCM-41
(MCM-41-IPr) [172]. In situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectro-
scopy (DRIFTS) showed that MCM-41-IPr was able to capture CO2 reversibly to
give an MCM-41-IPr-CO2 adduct.
Based on this result, it has been proposed that the zwitterionic moiety IPr-CO2
on MCM-41 may attack one of the carbon atoms of the aziridine ring to generate a
new zwitterion (Scheme 4.36). Nucleophilic attack of the formed nitrogen anion to
the carbon atom of the carbonyl group produced oxazolidinones by intramolecular
cyclic elimination. Finally, the MCM-41-IPr produced reacted quickly with CO2 to
regenerate the MCM-41-IPr-CO2 adduct.

Scheme 4.38 Proposed mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 with vinylaziridines promoted
by Pd(0) (adapted from [174])
as the catalyst (10 mol%) [173]. However, the process was poorly selective as a
mixture of the 4- and 5-regioisomers was obtained in all the cases investigated. The
mechanism proposed for the electrocarboxylation process involves, as a ﬁrst step,
cathodic reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0), which adds oxidatively the aziridine ring to
give a four-membered azanickelacycle. Further CO2 uptake and ring closure gen-
erate the cyclic carbamate. Under the working conditions, the latter process

competes with oxalate formation resulting from cathodic reduction of CO2 to CO2

radical anion, which undergoes head-to-head dimerization to oxalate.
Ring opening of vinylaziridines can be catalytically promoted by Pd(0). Under
ambient atmosphere of carbon dioxide, 5-vinyloxazolidinones were obtained regio-
and stereoselectively (Scheme 4.38) [174].
Recently, the reaction of insertion of CO2 into the aziridine ring has been
investigated in sc-CO2 [175] and the formation of copolymers has been shown to
occur under good control.

The insertion of CO2 into metal–metal bonds may lead to the formation of reduced
species of the cumulene. So, it has been found that CO2 may react with Fe–Zr and
Ru–Zr bonds to give M–C(O)O–Zr species as product of interaction (where
M ¼ Fe, Ru) [176]. It is interesting to note that the insertion takes place in full
respect of the oxophilicity and carbophilicity of the elements. In fact, in all cases the
more oxophylic Zr is linked to the O atom, whereas the more carbophilic Fe or Ru is
linked to the C atom. On the other hand, as discussed in Chap. 2, both Fe and Ru are
able to afford M-η1(C)–CO2 complexes (Scheme 4.39).

Insertion into Si–H Bonds
The insertion of CO2 into Si–H bonds leads, as a ﬁrst step, to the formation of
R3SiOCH(O) moieties, formally considered as formate-silyl esters [177]. Such
systems can be of interest as intermediates in catalysis in view of the easy hydro-
lysis of the Si–O–C bond or for their further reaction with Si–H bonds or any acid
E–H bond. Scheme 4.40 shows that the silyl-formate can react with other R3Si–H
moieties to afford the R3Si–O–CH2O–Si species and, ﬁnally, the R3Si–O–CH3,
precursor of methanol, CH3OH.

with Group 1 derivatives of phenol under forcing conditions (Scheme 4.42).
Such reaction has been re-examined more recently [183] and some elements of
knowledge have been added to its otherwise not yet completely elucidated reaction
mechanism.
A case related to the above is represented by the reaction with CO2 of σ-PhO-Mn

In this case, the reaction is promoted by the tautomerism –CH2–CO– $ –

The resulting anion –CH¼CO()– in equilibrium with –CH()–CO– makes possible
the CO2 trapping with formation of a C–CO2 bond (Scheme 4.43).
A similar reaction is also promoted by imidazolium carbene carboxylates [186]
as shown in (4.38), where the activated-H migrates to imidazole and CO2 forms a
C–C bond with acac.

More recently, the direct insertion of CO2 into the C–H bond of acac has been
shown to occur under photocatalysis (Scheme 4.44) [187]. The species identiﬁed as
the initiator of the reaction is the CO2
• radical anion. It extracts an H atom either
from the enolic form or from acac itself. Coupling of COOH with the acac-radical
afford the acids.
Interestingly, under photocatalysis two different isomeric acids are obtained that
imply the CO2 insertion into the activated methylenic C–H bond but also into the
more inert C–H bond of the terminal –CH3 moiety, which was not affected under
chemical catalysis.
This ﬁeld deserves more research effort as the exploitation of the insertion into
the C–H bond has great industrial potential for the synthesis of the –CO2H moiety,
which today is obtained through quite tortuous routes based on oxidation reactions
which are often neither selective nor C-efﬁcient.

Insertion of CO2 into E–X Bonds
4.11
Conclusions
The study of the reaction of CO2 with several sets of E–X bonds has contributed to
knowledge about the reactivity of the heterocumulene under different conditions,
opening the path to the development of new metal-promoted synthetic methodol-
ogies and to new catalytic processes. The fundamental studies described in this
chapter have great importance for the development of CO2-chemistry, in its many
aspects, from its use as a building block with incorporation of the entire
heterocumulene into organic compounds (Chaps. 5 and 6) to its use as carbon
source in reduction reactions for the production of molecules characterized by
higher energy, either C1 or Cn molecules (Chaps. 7 and 8).
The basic concepts presented in this chapter are examples of application of the
general principles described in the previous Chaps. 1 and 2, and represent the pillars
on which CO2 conversion is based: they are encountered and applied very often in
reactions described in the following chapters.
Several aspects of the reactivity of the heterocumulene still need investigation,
and new aspects will be discovered as our knowledge progresses.

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
Reactions with Oleﬁns, Cumulated and Conjugated
Dienes, and Alkynes
Abstract In the presence of low-valent transition metal centers, CO2 can react
with unsaturated organic substrates, such as alkenes, alkynes, and conjugated and
cumulated dienes, to give carboxylated products. This chapter focuses on the main
mechanistic features of these carboxylation processes. A key step of these trans-
formations is the metal-promoted oxidative coupling reaction between CO2 and the
unsaturated substrate. The mechanistic details of this step are highlighted and the
relevance and role of CO2 coordination to metal center in these reactions is argued.
5.1
Introduction
Under suitable conditions, CO2 can interact with C–C multiple bonds of alkenes,
conjugated dienes, cumulenes, and alkynes [1–9]. The interaction results in the
coupling (see Sect. 5.2) of the organic substrate with the heterocumulene. These
reactions are key steps for the functionalization of the above substrates, as they
provide a powerful synthetic tool for the formation of a new C–C bond, and they
open a further route, in addition to the insertion reactions (see also Chap. 4), to the
incorporation of the heterocumulene into a variety of new carboxylated products
(acids, esters, lactones, pyrones, etc.) often characterized by complex molecular
structures and widely used in several ﬁelds (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.). The
coupling reaction is promoted by a low-valent transition metal center, which
undergoes oxidation. The carboxylation process may either occur stoichio-
metrically or proceed catalytically, depending on the nature of the organic substrate,
the metal center, the ancillary ligands, and, more generally, the reaction conditions.
This chapter discusses the basic mechanistic aspects of these carboxylation
processes and brings into focus the mechanistic details of the oxidative coupling
reaction between CO2 and the unsaturated substrate (oleﬁn, conjugated diene,
cumulene, alkyne) with the purpose of highlighting, whenever possible, the rele-
vance and role of CO2 coordination to the metal center in these transformations.

5.2
Oxidative Coupling with CO2
In the presence of a suitable transition metal center, CO2 can react with a variety of
unsaturated substrates, A¼B, to form ﬁve-membered metallaheterocycles, as
shown in Scheme 5.1a. This process implies the coupling of the CO2 molecule
with an unsaturated substrate A¼B and the formation of three new σ-bonds, M–A,
B–C, and O–M. The two electrons that are required to form these bonds are
provided by the metal center, whose formal oxidation state increases by two units
(5.1). Remarkably, in the known examples, the oxygen of CO2 binds to the

but examples involving low-valent complexes of other transition metals (Ti, Zr, Ta,
Mo, Fe, Mn, Pd, Rh, Pt, etc.) are also known [1–10]. The nature of A¼B may range
among a large variety of unsaturated substrates. In most cases, however, A¼B is an
unsaturated hydrocarbon (oleﬁn, diene, cumulene, alkyne, η2-aryne) and the
coupling reaction (B is a carbon atom) leads to the formation of a new C–C bond
144

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
[1–10]. These reactions are discussed in detail later. Relatively fewer studies have
dealt with the oxidative coupling of CO2 with nitroso- [11, 12] or diaza-compounds
[10] and hetero-oleﬁns, such as imines [1–10, 13], carbodiimides [14], azadienes
[1–9, 15], or aldehydes [1–9, 16]. The latter processes lead to the formation of a
new
C–N
(A¼B:
PhNO,
R–N¼N–R,
RCH¼NR,
RN¼C¼NR,
RCH¼N–
CH¼CHR) or C–O bond (A¼B: RCH¼O), depending on the nature of the substrate
A¼B.
The role of the unsaturated substrate A¼B can be played even by CO2 itself
[17]. The “head-to-tail” homocoupling of two CO2 molecules at the Ir(I) center of
IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 was described by Herskovitz [17] in 1976 and gives the
metallacyclic bis-CO2 adduct IrCl(C2O4)(PMe3)3 (Scheme 5.2).
Mechanistically, the formation of metallacycle (Scheme 5.1a) might result from
a “three-center” concerted reaction involving the metal, the substrate, and CO2, but
it is unlikely that the three reactants in Scheme 5.1 might react in one step. More
likely, the oxidative coupling reaction may proceed through a stepwise pathway,
involving either the coordination of CO2 to the metal center, followed by the
reaction of the CO2 adduct with the substrate (pathway (i); 5.2a, b),

Whatever pathway, (i) or (ii), may be followed, the role played by possible
intermediates such as LnM(A¼B)(CO2) on the path leading to the ﬁnal product,
LnM(A-B-C(O)O),, should be deﬁned too. These points are relevant to the general
question whether or not the coordination of CO2 to the metal center is a necessary
prerequisite for the functionalization of the substrate A¼B, and thus to the role of
transition metal complexes in CO2 ﬁxation. The elucidation of these mechanistic

details by means of experimental methods is not an easy task, however, and reliable
answers have often been obtained only by modeling these processes by means of
quantomechanical methods.
Pathway (ii) has been documented experimentally in a number of cases.

The
nitrosobenzene adduct Rh(4-MeC6H4)(PhNO)[t-BuP(CH2CH2CH2PPh2)2] is a pos-
sible intermediate of the rhodium-assisted CO2/PhNO coupling reaction. In fact,
this species, which can be isolated from mixtures of the tolyl–rhodium(I) complex
and nitrosobenzene, interacted with carbon dioxide to give the carboxylated
metallacycle complex. An analogous reaction was also described by Cenini, who
observed the reversible oxidative coupling reaction of carbon dioxide with
nitrosobenzene η2-coordinated at platinum(0) [12].
The reaction of the nickel(0) complex Ni(bpy)(cod) (bpy ¼ 2,20-bipyridine;
cod ¼ 1,4-cyclooctadiene) with propionaldehyde and CO2 has been the subject of
a detailed kinetic study [16]. It has been shown that carbon dioxide did not react
with Ni(bpy)(cod) directly but with the nickel propionaldehyde complex Ni(bpy)
(RCH¼O) resulting from the reversible displacement of the cod ligand by the
aldehyde, with formation of a ﬁve-membered cyclic complex (Scheme 5.3). The
cyclization reaction with CO2 proceeded irreversibly according to an associative
mechanism, implying the insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni–O bond of Ni(bpy)
(RCH¼O). The activation parameters for the latter process were ΔH{ ¼ 43  6 kJ/
mol and ΔS{ ¼ 129  19 J/(mol K). The large negative activation entropy con-
ﬁrms the oxidative coupling step, with bond formation and charge

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
The formation of IrCl(C2O4)(PMe3)3 from IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 and CO2
(Scheme 5.2) necessarily implies the intermediacy of a CO2-Ir adduct. The mecha-
nistic details of this reaction are not known. The authors assume that IrCl(C2O4)
(PMe3)3 is formed from IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 via stepwise uptake of two CO2
molecules with concomitant displacement of cyclooctene. The reaction is believed
to be initiated by addition of the nucleophilic IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 to a CO2 molecule,
with one of the two (more basic) oxygens binding a second CO2 molecule through C.
Cyclization via Ir–O bond formation affords the product.
5.3
Carboxylation of Oleﬁns
Stoichiometric carboxylation of oleﬁns has been achieved by using a variety of low
valent transition metal (Ti, Zr, V, Mo, W, Rh, Ni, Fe) complexes [1–10, 18–
26]. Metallacyclocarboxylates have been generated and/or isolated by oxidative
coupling of alkenes with CO2 in the presence of Ni(0) [1–10], or Ti [18–20], Zr [1–
9, 21], V [22], or Rh [23] reagents (Scheme 5.4). In the presence of Ni(0) the
reaction may proceed reversibly depending on the nature of the ancillary ligands at
the metal center: only N- or P-chelating ligands, such as TMEDA (N,N,N0,N0-
tetramethyl-1,2-ethylenediamine),
bpy,
dcpe
(1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)
ethane), and dppe (1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), were consistent with a
reversible path, whereas P–N chelating ligands, such as (alkyl)2P–CH2CH2–N
(alkyl)2, promoted the carboxylation reaction irreversibly. In agreement with the
reversibility of the reaction, it was possible to replace, by other alkenes or alkynes,
the oleﬁn which has undergone coupling to form a ﬁve-membered ring metallacycle
[1–10]. The formation of the nickelaheterocycles proceeds under kinetic control
and the yield of the thermodynamically more stable ﬁnal product depends on
temperature and reaction time. Complexes with a primary carbon bound to nickel
were thermodynamically more stable than those with a secondary carbon–
nickel bond.
A few L2Ni(CH2CH2C(O)O) nickelacycles have also been structurally character-
ized (L ¼ DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene); L2 ¼ bpy, Ph2P(O)CH2PPh2)
[24, 25]. Complex (DBU)2
, prepared from Ni(cod)2 and DBU in
the presence of CO2/C2H4, underwent further ethene insertion to give a seven-
membered ring complex, which, by subsequent β-H elimination and acid hydrolysis,
gave pentenoic acids [25]. The Ni–C bond in (DBU)2Ni(CH2CH2C(O)O) was also
available for insertion reactions with functionalized oleﬁns and dienes, allowing the
synthesis, after acid hydrolysis, of various acid products.
Coupling between ethene and CO2 can also be induced by Fe(0) complexes
[26]. Remarkably, these systems can promote ethylene coupling with two CO2
molecules, affording a dicarboxylate which was esteriﬁed by means of acid hydro-
lysis in methanol. The nature of the ancillary ligands had a marked inﬂuence on the
product distribution. In the presence of PMe3, methyl malonate was obtained

exclusively, whereas methyl succinate was formed preferentially in the presence
of dcpe.
Despite the huge synthetic work, the mechanism of the coupling reaction of CO2
with oleﬁns (Scheme 5.4) in the presence of Ni(0) complexes has not been matter of
extensive experimental studies. The hypothesis that coordinated CO2 might react
with oleﬁn to afford a carboxylate metallacycle did not ﬁnd sound support in the
experiment. For instance, Aresta et al. found that Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2, in the solid
state, did not react with ethene even after 3 h at room temperature, whereas,
in solution, a substitution reaction occurred easily with the formation of Ni
(PCy3)2(C2H4) [27–29]. The CO2 substitution with ethene can be explained
considering either (1) oleﬁn attack to Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 in the state in which the
Ni–C bond is loosened (see Scheme 2.3(iii)) with subsequent CO2 elimination, or
(2) the reaction of ethene with “Ni(PCy3)2” formed upon CO2 dissociation. It is
worth noting that, in toluene, under nitrogen, Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 is in equilibrium
with the dinitrogen complex “Ni(PCy3)2(N2).” The mechanism involving phos-
phine dissociation seems to be unlikely, as NMR spectroscopy did not reveal any
free phosphine when Ni(η2-CO2)(PCy3)2 was dissolved in the presence of ethene.
However, whatever the substitution reaction mechanism may be, the above ﬁndings
clearly show that ethene is more tightly bound to “Ni(PCy3)2” than CO2, in
accordance with the results of a few early theoretical calculations carried out for
the model fragment “Ni(PH3)2” [30]. This conclusion also agrees with the fact that,
for instance, ﬁve-membered ring complexes L2Ni(CH2CH2C(O)O),, obtained from
alkenes and CO2, eliminate CO2 upon heating to give the corresponding (ligand)Ni
(0)–oleﬁn complex, which can be isolated as crystals [10, 31].
More recently, the mechanistic details of nickel(0)-assisted oxidative coupling
of CO2 with C2H4 have been studied by Papai et al. by means of density functional
calculations [32]. The basic question addressed in this theoretical study was
whether the intermediacy of a carbon dioxide complex is a general requirement
in CO2–C2H4 coupling reactions. The calculations have been carried out for the
model reaction (5.4), and have shown that this reaction is initiated by the addition
Ni(cdt) + bpy + CO2 + C2H4                   (bpy)Ni(CH2CH2C(O)O) + cdt
(cdt = 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene) 
ð5:4Þ
of chelating bpy to Ni(cdt) to form a ternary Ni(η2-cdt)(bpy) complex, which is
followed by an oleﬁn exchange that gives the Ni(bpy)(C2H4) intermediate. The
formation of the ethene complex Ni(bpy)(C2H4) via the replacement of the η2-
coordinated cdt ligand was favored energetically by 8.4 kcal/mol. The ligand
exchange for CO2 to give complex Ni(bpy)(CO2) was far less likely, because the
corresponding substitution reaction was predicted to be endothermic by 1.4 kcal/
mol. The

difference found for the stability of these complexes is consistent with the previ-
ously mentioned experimental observation that nickel–CO2 complexes can easily
undergo exchange reactions with oleﬁns. The saturated 18e Ni(bpy)(CO2)(C2H4)
complex, which was originally assumed to act as a precursor for the C–C bond
formation [31], was also identiﬁed as a local minimum in the calculations. This
complex, however, seems to be a fairly labile species, as it lies 7.1 kcal/mol higher
in energy than “Ni(bpy)(C2H4) + CO2,” and the barrier towards this dissociation
was calculated to be only 0.8 kcal/mol. It is therefore quite unlikely that complex Ni
(bpy)(CO2)(C2H4) may be an intermediate in the investigated reaction. The calcu-
lations showed that C–C bond formation in the present reaction occurred in a single
step from the reaction of the Ni(bpy)(C2H4) intermediate with an incoming CO2
molecule, supporting the fact that the formation of a “mixed” ethene-carbon
dioxide complex is not a prerequisite for the CO2–C2H4 coupling reaction. Never-
theless, the Ni(0) center has a prominent role in this reaction, because the C–C
coupling is initiated by the metal-induced activation of CO2 which allows the
oxidative coupling with the coordinated ethene. Analogous conclusions were also
achieved when dcpe or substituted bipyridines were selected as ancillary ligands in
place of bpy. A thorough investigation of the role of the co-ligand showed that the
two minima associated with the C–C bond formation and the related activation
barrier depended heavily on the nature of the chelating ligands.
Scheme 5.5 shows two possible ways through which a nickelacycle carboxylate
may, in principle, further react, once formed. Formation of β-lactone, which may
form from LnNi(CH2CH2C(O)O) by reductive elimination (route a), has never
been observed experimentally. On the other hand, the nickela-lactone may gener-
ate, through a β-H shift reaction, a nickel-hydrido-acrylate species, which may
reductively eliminate the unsaturated acid RCH¼CH2C(O)OH (route b).
Catalytic synthesis of acrylic acids by direct coupling of oleﬁns with CO2 has
attracted the interest of chemists since the early 1980s. Nevertheless, to date, this
5.3
Carboxylation of Oleﬁns

goal still remains elusive. Hoberg [33] reported the stoichiometric synthesis of
cynnamic acid, PhCH¼CH2C(O)OH, from styrene and CO2, in the presence of Ni
(cod)2 and DBU (L). At 333 K, these species converted into the metallacycle
carboxylate LnNi(PhCHCH2C(O)O).. The latter species liberated the saturated
acid PhCH2CH2C(O)OH upon acidiﬁcation, but, upon heating to 358 K and further
acid hydrolysis, LnNi(PhCHCH2C(O)O) released cynnamic acid in high yield
(>70 %). Formation of the unsaturated acid was believed to involve a Ni-hydrido-
acrylate intermediate species, LnNi(H)(OC(O)CH2¼CHPh), which, at higher tem-
perature (358 K), formed from LnNi(PhCHCH2C(O)O) by β-H elimination.
According to Hoberg, the transfer reaction of the hydride ligand from the nickel
center to the imine carbon of DBU ligand would prevent both the desired reductive
elimination of cynnamic acid and regeneration of the zerovalent nickel catalyst
from taking place, thus inhibiting the synthesis of the unsaturated acid to proceed
catalytically.
The synthesis of acrylic acid from ethene and CO2 over a Ni(cod)(DBU)2
catalyst has been modeled by using density functional theory (DFT) by Buntine
and coworkers [34]. The overall catalytic reaction to form acrylic acid through CO2
and ethene coupling can be described as having three main stages. Exothermic
formation of the ﬁve-membered nickelacycle (17.2 kJ/mol) drives the initial steps
of the reaction and includes overcoming a barrier of +121.8 kJ/mol. This barrier
corresponds to a transition structure characterized by the attack of CO2 on nickel-
coordinated ethene, in agreement with the previously discussed results of Papai.
From the nickela-lactone, elongation of the Ni–O bond precedes β-H elimination
through a transition structure located at +147.4 kJ/mol, resulting in a nickel-
hydrido-acrylate species in which the acrylate moiety is bound through both
oxygens (+21.3 kJ/mol). The ﬁnal reductive elimination of acrylic acid might
occur via a number of routes, the lowest energy of which takes place via a ﬁve-
centered transition structure (+104.1 kJ/mol) involving the coupling of the hydride
ligand with an unbound oxygen of the acrylate ligand. The calculations showed that
the three main steps (oxidative coupling, β-H shift, reductive elimination) exhibited
substantial energy barriers, but not so large that would be expected to prohibit the
overall catalytic process. The catalyst deactivation reaction (H transfer to DBU),
proposed by Hoberg to justify the lack of observed catalytic activity, is subject to a
moderate barrier (+150.2 kJ/mol), but the proposed product lies +102.6 kJ/mol
above the reactants, thereby ruling out this type of pathway as the cause of the
non-catalytic activity. It is plausible that thermodynamic rather than kinetic con-
straints may prevent the overall reaction from taking place to a signiﬁcant extent, in
accordance with the solvation-corrected Gibbs free energy of the coupling reaction
in question, which has been calculated to be unfavorable by +42.7 kJ/mol. In this
regard, it is of interest to note that acrylic acid has been reported to react with Ni
(cod)2 (1 equiv.) in the presence of PCy3 (1 equiv.) to give the nickela-lactone
species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2C(O)O) [35].

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
The body of experimental evidence indicates that, in most of CO2-alkene
coupling reactions, the metalla-lactone structure represents a thermodynamic
sink, as the metallacycle was found to be the ﬁnal product. Only recently the
conversion of nickela-lactones into acrylate species has been documented experi-
mentally in an unambiguous way. This process can be induced either by ligand
substitution with a suitable chelating agent and subsequent chelate activation [36]
or by addition of strong electrophiles [37]. Walther et al. [36] have reported the
conversion of nickelacycle carboxylates into nickel-hydrido-acrylates in reactions
with 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm). These hydridoacrylates then
evolved to give dimeric phosphido–Ni complexes bearing a bridging acrylate
ligand. Moreover, Rieger succeeded in obtaining modest yields of methyl acrylate
by methylation of nickela-lactones with MeI [37]. This result is quite intriguing as it
emphasizes that alkyl esters of acrylic acids can be released more easily than the
corresponding acids from nickela-lactones. A previous example of liberation of
alkyl acrylates from the coordination sphere of a metal center was ﬁrst documented
by Aresta et al. [38] by reacting Pd complexes coordinating a preformed

The reductive elimination of acrylic acid from a hydrido–acrylate metal complex
(see Scheme 5.5, right) is a kinetically (and thermodynamically) hindered process
and never observed. It closely resembles the elimination of formic acid from
hydrido formate metal complexes LnM(H)OCHO. In the latter case, the elimination
process is in general facilitated by using an appropriate “shuttle” of the hydride
(amines R3N are used that are transformed into ammonium cations R3NH+) or of
the formate anion (Group 1 metal cations are candidates, with K+ as the most
suited). The use of a K+(Na+) shuttle has been investigated by Limback [39] who
has reported a catalytic (also if limited to a few cycles) formation of
CH2¼CHCOOM (M ¼ K, Na) by using Ni(0) catalysts in the presence of MOH
(Scheme 5.5, left). This reaction has an industrial interest as acrylates are used as
adsorbents.
Nevertheless, metal-hydrido-acrylate species can be more straightforwardly
obtained from ethene and CO2 by suitably changing the metal center. Carmona
et al. found that a few Mo and W complexes possessed very similar chemistry and
promoted the coupling of ethene and CO2, affording dimeric (Mo, W) or mono-
meric (W) hydridoacrylate complexes which, unfortunately, were unable to elimi-
nate acrylic acid (Structure 5.2) [40, 41]. For instance, in diethyl ether, the reactions

Scheme 5.7 summarizes the mechanism postulated by the authors for the genesis
of the acrylate derivatives. The ﬁrst step is the substitution of PMe3 by CO2 with
formation of an intermediate undetected species, “M(C2H4)2(CO2)(PMe3)3,”
followed by oxidative coupling of C2H4 and CO2 to afford a ﬁve-membered
metalla-lactone, which could undergo β-H elimination to produce the hydrido-
acrylate structure.
The consistency of the proposed mechanism has been supported by a few DFT
calculations, which have been carried out for the speciﬁc case where M is molyb-
denum [42]. The substitution of one PMe3 ligand by CO2 takes place through a
dissociative pathway. The substitution is slightly exothermic and leads to the
complex Mo(C2H4)2(CO2)(PMe3)3, which is the key intermediate in the CO2–
C2H4 coupling process. The coupling takes place in a coplanar arrangement of
the reacting ligands via a ﬁve-center transition state, resulting in a nearly planar
metalla-lactone species. Differently from nickel (see above), coordination of CO2
molecule to the metal center is a necessary step to achieve the CO2–alkene
coupling, because the formation of the new C–C bond is promoted by a simul-
taneous metal ! CO2 and metal ! C2H4 electron donation mechanism. The
formation of the metalla-lactone species is thermodynamically allowed, and the
activation barrier has been estimated to be 11 kcal/mol. The ﬁve-membered
metallacycle was found to be able to distort and adopt a structure involving
β-agostic interactions. The agostic complex is also a crucial intermediate along
the reaction path, because it facilitates the formation of the metal-hydride species
through a β-hydrogen transfer process. The hydride formation is an exothermic
step, with a related energy barrier (10 kcal/mol) comparable to that of the C–C
coupling. The hydrido-acrylate monomer is already well below the energy of the
reactants, but further stabilization is achieved by the dimerization process.
The mechanism of carbon dioxide functionalization with ethene at a molybde-
num center has been investigated experimentally by Bernskoetter and Tyler [43], by
reacting the zerovalent molybdenum complex, trans-(triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2
(triphos ¼ (Ph2PCH2CH2)2PPh), with CO2. This reaction afforded the bridging
acrylate hydride complex, [(triphos)Mo-(H)(OC(O)CH¼CH2)]2 (5.6). Monitoring
in situ the addition of CO2 to a benzene-d6 solution of the bis(dinitrogen)–molyb-
denum(0)–ethene complex by NMR spectroscopy revealed the formation of a long-
lived reaction intermediate characterized as (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2). The latter
complex formed rapidly (15 min) from (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2 in the presence
5.3

of excess CO2 and converted slowly to the acrylate hydride species [(triphos)Mo(H)
(OC(O)CH¼CH2)]2 over several hours. The mechanism of carbon dioxide substi-
tution with (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2 was explored. The coordinative saturation of
complex (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2 implies that the substitution process to form
(triphos)Mo (C2H4)(CO2) is dissociative in nature. Accordingly, the experiments
are consistent with formation of intermediate (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) by revers-
ible dinitrogen loss from (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2 followed by slow, irreversible,
binding of carbon dioxide with loss of a second N2 ligand.

The observation of (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) on the path to C–C bond formation
between CO2 and ethene provides the ﬁrst experimental evidence that simultaneous
coordination of both ethene and carbon dioxide at a metal center is a prerequisite for
coupling the two unsaturates. This behavior is somewhat different from what was
described to occur at nickel centers (see above). It cannot be excluded that the
requirement of precoordination of both CO2 and oleﬁn, although being less strin-
gent for late transition metal centers such as Ni, may likely be general for early
transition metal centers.
The possibility of generating cleanly the intermediate complex (triphos)Mo
(C2H4)(CO2) was further exploited to study the kinetics and mechanism of
molybdenum-mediated acrylate formation from CO2 and ethene, for which an
observed rate constant of 3.8(3)  105 s1 was measured at 296 K corresponding
to an activation energy of 23.5(2) kcal/mol. Kinetic analysis of the conversion of
(triphos)Mo(C2D4)(CO2) provided a slightly lower value for the observed rate
constant (3.1(5)  105 s1 at 296 K) and revealed an isotopic effect of 1.2(2) for
(triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) vs (triphos)Mo(C2D4)(CO2) at 296 K. This small isotope
effect is not consistent with a kinetic proﬁle implying, as the rate-limiting step,
β-hydride elimination from a metalla-lactone complex, which is expected to produce
a more signiﬁcant primary isotope effect. Measuring rate constants of the reaction
over a 40 K temperature range allowed the computation of activation parameters for
acrylate formation of ΔS{ ¼ 1(7) eu and ΔH{ ¼ 24(3) kcal/mol. The very low value
of ΔS{ implicates a unimolecular transition structure for the rate-determining step,
which, along with the small isotope effect for kC2H4/kC2D4, is consistent with
oxidative C–C bond formation as the slow step during acrylate formation.

Scheme 5.9 Proposed mechanism for nickel-catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of styrenes (adapted

and ethyl propionate [44] or Ru-promoted carboxylation of propene to butyric
esters [45] should be considered with caution as genuine examples of carboxylative
processes, because, in both cases, there is no real proof that the carboxyl group
derives from CO2 [5, 6]. Du~
nach [46] extended to oleﬁn carboxylation an electro-
chemical method successfully developed for catalytic incorporation of CO2 into
alkynes (see Sect. 5.4 for further details) and based on the use of a catalytic amount
of a Ni(II) complex as the catalyst precursor. Later on, signiﬁcant breakthrough in
catalytic carboxylation of monooleﬁns has been achieved by Rovis and coworkers
[47], who developed a protocol for nickel-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of
styrenes under a CO2 atmosphere. The latter study provided the ﬁrst example of
direct hydrocarboxylation of a single oleﬁn. The reaction was carried out in THF,
under mild conditions (room temperature, 0.1 MPa CO2 pressure), in the presence
of catalytic amounts (10 mol%) of Ni(cod)2 or Ni(acac)2 (acac ¼ acetylacetonate), a
base additive (20 mol%), and an organozinc reagent (ZnEt2, 2.5 equiv.). The
method proved to be effective for a variety of styrene derivatives with electron-
withdrawing or neutral substituents and was tolerant of a variety of functional
groups. The reaction was regioselective, as the α-carboxylated regioisomer

(Scheme 5.8) was produced selectively. The suggested mechanism implies a nickel-
hydride active catalyst, instead of a classic Hoberg-type oxanickelacycle
(Scheme 5.9). The intermediacy of a metal-hydride species is a peculiarity also
distinguishing other metal-catalyzed hydrocarboxylation reactions [48–51]. Inser-
tion of a styrene moiety into the nickel–hydride bond provides a benzyl nickel
species which undergoes carboxylation. Subsequent trans-metalation of the reac-
tion intermediate with Et2Zn yields the hydrocarboxylation product and releases the
precatalyst.

Carboxylation of Alkynes
Alkynes and CO2 can react stoichiometrically in the presence of Ni(0) complexes
stabilized by P- or N-ancillary ligands (dcpe, dppe, bpy, TMEDA, DBU, etc.) to
afford unsaturated pentaatomic oxanickelacycles (Scheme 5.10) [1–10]. Oxametal-
lacyclopentenones have also been obtained by reaction of CO2 with Ni- or Ta-aryne
[1] complexes or by reacting the heterocumulene with alkyne complexes of Ti(II) or
Zr(II) [1, 3, 19, 20].
Hoberg [1–10] ﬁrst emphasized the synthetic potential of oxametallacyclo-
pentenones, showing that they are useful starting materials or intermediates for
the synthesis of unsaturated cyclic anhydrides (for instance, substituted maleic
anhydrides, which can be obtained from the oxanickelacycles by reductive carbon-
ylation with CO) or unsaturated carboxylic acids, which can be released upon
protonolysis. The stoichiometric coupling reaction has also proved to be useful
for the synthesis of unsaturated carboxylic acids through carboxylation and

cyclization of enynes [48, 52, 53]. The latter reaction seems to proceed through
oxidative cycloaddition of the α,ω-enyne moiety to the zero-valent nickel complex,
regioselective insertion of carbon dioxide at the C(sp3)–nickel bond, and hydrolysis
of the resulting oxanickelacycle intermediate (Scheme 5.11).
The stoichiometric alkyne/CO2 coupling reaction (Scheme 5.10) was adapted to
work catalytically with respect to Ni, using chemical or electrochemical
approaches.
Du~
nach [54, 55] reported the catalytic synthesis of a number of α,β-unsaturated
carboxylic acid Mg salts from alkynes and CO2 in the presence of catalytic amounts
of LnNi(II)-complexes (L ¼ bpy, etc.), using a sacriﬁcial Mg anode in a single-
compartment electrochemical cell in which the catalytically active LnNi(0)-reagent
was catalytically regenerated at the cathode. The oxanickelacycle intermediate
(Scheme 5.10; Ln ¼ bpy) was isolated from the reaction mixture in the case of
4-octyne. Ni(II) was liberated from the metallacycle and recycled in the presence of
Mg2+ ions and an appropriate proton source such as (NBu4)BF4 (supporting elec-
trolyte) or DMF (reaction solvent). In this process, the nickel-magnesium exchange
reaction is the key step to explain nickel catalysis. In fact, when the electrolysis was
run in a two-compartment cell in the absence of magnesium ions, the

Scheme 5.12 Alkylative or arylative carboxylation of alkynes: proposed mechanism
reaction stopped at the stage of the metallacycle formation. The nickel species was
not recycled and, therefore, the reaction occurred stoichiometrically.
Using stoichiometric amounts of an alkylzinc reagent and catalytic amounts of
Ni(0)/DBU, Mori was able to prepare a number of β-alkylated or arylated α,-
β-unsaturated carboxylic acids from alkynes and CO2 (Scheme 5.12) [56,
57]. Through a trans-metalation reaction with the oxanickelacyclopentenone inter-
mediate, the alkyl zinc reagent effected the reductive elimination of the product
from the nickel center with concomitant regeneration of the active zerovalent
catalyst.
5.4
Carboxylation of Alkynes
157
Catalytic carboxylation of internal alkynes with CO2 has been achieved in the
presence of Ni [50] or Cu [51] catalysts, and through a hydrocarboxylative path-
way, not involving the intermediacy of a metallaoxacyclopentenone, but, as previ-
ously noted for the hydrocarboxylation of alkenes (see Sect. 5.3), implying the
intermediate formation of an M–H catalytically active species, which may easily be
generated in the reaction mixture using diethylzinc [50] or hydrosilanes [51] as
hydride transfer agent.
In principle, coupling reactions involving terminal alkynes and carbon dioxide
can generate α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids, which may be β- or α-substituted
according to whether the alkyne is carboxylated at the 1- or 2-position
(Scheme 5.13). Carboxylation at the 1-position of the alkyne was found to be
predominant when the coupling reaction was carried out in THF at 273 K and
promoted by Ni(DBU)2 generated in situ [56–58]. These results are in sharp
contrast with those of Du~
nach et al. [54], who, using electrochemically generated
(bpy)2Ni complex in DMF at 293–353 K, showed that product regioselectivity was
dominated by the α-regioisomer, involving carboxylation at the 2-position of the
alkyne. Even subtle variations in the ancillary ligand or changes in the electronic
and steric nature of alkyne can markedly affect the regioselectivity of the process
[59, 60]. Using the Ni-promoted alkylative carboxylation protocol mentioned above
and a variety of trimethylsilyl(TMS)-substituted alkynes (RCC–SiMe3), Mori
observed
the
predominant
formation
of
α-silyl-β,β0-dialkyl-substituted

β-unsaturated carboxylic acids, whereas, with t-Bu (RCC–CMe3) and Ph

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
donating (4-OMe) to electron-withdrawing (4-CO2Me) substituents on the Ph group
increased preference for the pathway involving the carboxylation of the alkyne
carbon bearing the aryl group.
Electronic effects of the substituents on the acetylenic carbons, as well as the
nature of the ancillary ligands coordinated to nickel center, also markedly affect the
rate of the coupling reaction. Saito [58] compared the carboxylation rates of both
Ph–CCH and 4-MeO–C6H4–CCH with CO2 in the presence of Ni(cod)2/DBU
(2 equiv.) and found that ethynylbenzene was carboxylated faster than 4-methoxy-
1-ethynylbenzene, whereas Du~
nach noted that the reaction rate increased with the
basicity of the ancillary ligand [59].
Only a limited number of theoretical studies have focused on the mechanism of
oxidative coupling of alkynes with carbon dioxide [61–64]. The Ni(DBU)2-medi-
ated coupling reaction of alkynes with CO2 has been modeled simultaneously and
independently by two different groups using DFT approaches [63, 64]. Like the
nickel-assisted ethylene/CO2 coupling, the reaction pathway seems to proceed
through an associative mechanism, involving, ﬁrst, the η2-coordination of the
alkyne to zerovalent nickel with formation of L2Ni(η2-alkyne) (L ¼ DBU [63] or
1,2-dimethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine selected as a model ligand (mDBU) for
DBU [64]), which is followed by subsequent attack of the CO2 carbon to one of the
carbons of the coordinated alkyne. No evidence was found for a transition structure
corresponding to attack of alkyne to nickel-bound CO2. Analogously, the calcula-
tions did not support a dissociative pathway involving (1) the formation of a L2Ni
(η2-CO2)(η2-alkyne) complex (18 e), (2) dissociation of one of the L ligands with
generation of a LNi(η2-CO2)(η2-alkyne) intermediate (16 e), (3) followed by the
oxidative coupling step to afford the ﬁve-membered oxanickelacycle complex,
which, ﬁnally, (4) re-coordinates L. The associative mechanism is preferred
because more L ligands in the transition state make the coordinated alkyne substrate
more electron-rich and more prone to electrophilic attack.
The issue of regioselectivity has also been addressed. Buntine’s group [64],
using a few terminal alkynes such as TMS–CC–H, t-Bu–CC–H, Ph–CC–H,
and MeO-p-C6H4–CC–H calculated that the 3-R-substituted oxanickelacycle
(path b, Scheme 5.13; L ¼ mDBU, n ¼ 2) was the thermodynamically preferred
product for all the substrates investigated, because of the lower steric interaction
between the alkyne-substituent and the ancillary ligand. However, the transition
structure characterized by the attack of CO2 on the alkyne carbon distal from the
R-group
was
generally
lower
in
energy,
making
the
2-R-substituted
oxanickelacycle (path a, Scheme 5.13; L ¼ mDBU, n ¼ 2) the kinetically favored
product. An exception to the above generalization was provided by the
TMS-substituted alkyne, where the 3-R-substituted nickelacycle was calculated to
be both kinetically and thermodynamically favored. In the latter case, the kinetic
preference for path (b) over path (a) in Scheme 5.13 has been ascribed to the sheer
size of the substituent, with the steric interaction between the incoming CO2 moiety
and the TMS group in path (b)-TS (transition state) being energetically more
favorable than the steric hindrance between the TMS group and the ancillary ligand
in path (a)-TS.
5.4
Carboxylation of Alkynes
159
Li et al. [63], using Ni(DBU)2 as promoter, focused on different model terminal
alkynes, such as Me–CC–H, MeO–CC–H, and NC–CC–H, which exhibit a
very different substituent effect. Electronic factors easily explain the results that
NC–CCH gives the highest barrier whereas MeO–CCH gives the lowest barrier:
the MeO-group makes the π-bonds of the substrate more electron-rich, whereas the
CN-substituent makes the π-bonds more electron-poor. However, whatever the
alkyne electronic properties are, the coupling reaction provided the same
regioselectivity, because the 2-R-substituted nickelacycle (path a, Scheme 5.13;
L ¼ DBU, n ¼ 2) was calculated to be the kinetically preferred regioisomer product
for all the three substrates investigated, and also more stable from the thermo-
dynamic point of view for R equal to OMe or CN. The calculations indicated that
regioselectivity was dominated by steric repulsive interactions between the substi-
tuent at the alkyne carbon which forms the new carbon–carbon bond with the CO2
carbon, and the unreacted C¼O group of CO2. For silyl-substituted internal
alkynes, such as MeCCTMS, the additional steric repulsive interaction between
the sterically demanding TMS substituent and the DBU ligand at the metal center
also needs to be taken into account, when the regioselectivity is considered. In the
latter case, both the additional steric effects and electronic factors favored the
formation of compounds in which CO2 couples with the silyl-substituted carbon,
as also documented experimentally by Mori [56].
Replacing the DBU ancillary ligand with bpy resulted in higher activation
energies [63, 64], making the bpy ligand a not so good ligand as DBU for the
Ni-mediated coupling reactions, as observed early experimentally by Saito
et al. [58] using THF as the reaction solvent (T ¼ 273 K). The bpy ligand is less
electron-donating than the DBU ligand. Consequently, the coordinated alkyne is
not electron-rich enough and exhibits poorer nucleophilicity, leading to higher
coupling barriers. According to the calculations in this case (see Scheme 5.13;
Ln ¼ bpy, R ¼ Me [63], Ph or t-Bu [64]) path (a) is kinetically favored over path (b),
which leads to the thermodynamically more stable 3-R-substituted regioisomer.
However, in the Ni/bpy system there is less driving force for the formation of the
regioisomeric products relative to the encounter complex “(bpy)Ni(η2-alkyne)
+ CO2.” The combination of a sterically demanding alkyne, such as t-BuCCH,
with the bpy/Ni system even exhibits no driving force (ΔG ¼ +0.7 kJ/mol) for the
formation of the kinetically preferred 2-R-susbstituted oxanickelacycle, and thus
the thermodynamically preferred 3-R-substituted regioisomer would likely result.
Buntine [64] calculated that changing solvent from THF to DMF caused a
decrease of activation barriers independent of the other parameters, without any
preference for path (a) or (b) in Scheme 5.13 [L ¼ DBU (n ¼ 2) or bpy (n ¼ 1)]. The
latter ﬁnding is relevant to the results reported by Du~
nach (see above), who
effectively used the electrochemically generated bpy/Ni(0) system as carboxylation
catalyst, in DMF as reaction solvent [54, 55, 59]. The dominance of 3-R-substituted
regioisomer products observed by Du~
nach [54, 55, 59] in her experiments may be
related to the use of the bpy/Ni system which may disfavor the formation of
sterically hindered 2-R-substituted products more than the DBU/Ni system. How-
ever, a different simpler explanation cannot be excluded, as the higher reaction
160

temperatures (293–353 K) used by Du~
nach may help to favor the thermo-
dynamically preferred 3-R-substituted product over the kinetically preferred 2-R-
substituted regioisomer.
Internal or terminal alkynes can be catalytically converted into 2-pyrones by
reaction with CO2 in the presence of phosphine–Ni(0) complexes (5.7). In addition
to 2-pyrones, cyclo-oligomers may also form as by-products.

This reaction (5.7) was ﬁrst reported by Inoue [65], using Ni(cod)2/dppe as
catalytic system, and further developed by Walther and coworkers [66], who set
up an improved synthetic protocol capable of producing 2-pyrones with high yield
and selectivity. The method involved the use of a THF-acetonitrile mixture as
reaction solvent, in combination with monodentate basic phosphines with small
cone angles (PEt3, for instance). High yield and selectivity in pyrone have also been
achieved using PMe3 as ancillary ligand and supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO2)
as reactant and reaction medium [67]. Kishimoto [68] has described a new catalytic
system, based on Ni(cod)2 and P(C4H9)3 or P(C8H17)3, which promoted the syn-
thesis of a wide range of substituted pyrones with high yield (up to 98 %) and
selectivity (up to 99 %) in compressed (4–14 MPa) CO2. Tsuda et al. [8] signiﬁ-
cantly expanded the scope of reaction (5.7) using alkoxyalkynes or α,ω-diynes as
substrates and developed interesting syntheses of highly functionalized cyclic
compounds and novel polymeric materials. Later, the Ni(0)-catalyzed synthesis of
2-pyrones from CO2 and diynes was reinvestigated and improved by Louie using
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) as ancillary ligands. A Ni(0)/NHC catalytic system
was shown to promote effectively the pyrone synthesis at ambient temperature and
0.1 MPa CO2 pressure [69].
An insight into the mechanism of the Ni-catalyzed formation of pyrone (5.7) has
been gained by Hoberg [10, 31, 70, 71] and Walther [9, 72, 73]. According to the
generally accepted mechanism (Scheme 5.14), the ﬁrst step of the catalytic cycle is
the formation of oxanickelacyclopentenone A. This intermediate can insert another
alkyne molecule into the Ni–C(sp2) bond to afford the oxanickelacyclo-
heptadienone B, from which the pyrone product is liberated by reductive elimi-
nation. This mechanism ﬁnds sound support in the fact that, by using bidentate
basic stabilizing ligands such as TMEDA, for instance, it was possible to isolate and
characterize oxanickelacyclopentenone complexes, which have been shown to
react with one more alkyne molecule affording oxanickelacycloheptadienone spe-
cies, from which 2-pyrone can be released on heating. Comparative stoichiometric
studies have not conﬁrmed the hypothesis, initially proposed by Inoue [65], that
pyrone synthesis might imply the preliminary coupling of two alkyne

molecules to form a nickelacyclopentadiene complex, followed by CO2 insertion
into the Ni–C bond or [4 + 2] cycloaddition to a CO2 molecule. On the contrary,
nickelacyclopentadiene species are involved as intermediates only in the alkyne
cyclotrimerization.
Formation of cyclotrimer by-products emphasizes the ability of the catalytic
system to catalyze not only the substrate/CO2 hetero-coupling reaction but also
homo-coupling processes. Homo-coupling can involve not only the substrate, as in
the case of the formation of (cyclo)oligomers but also CO2 itself. Walther et al. [72,
73] have shown that a competing reaction in the catalytic cyclooligomerization of
hex-3-yne with CO2 in the presence of Ni(TMEDA)(cod) is the formation of carbon
monoxide and a nickel trimer with two (TMEDA)Ni(CO3) units. The latter reaction
pathway leads to catalyst deactivation. The reduction of CO2 to CO probably
proceeds through a nickelacycle intermediate analogous to that isolated with
iridium (Scheme 5.2) involving the head-to-tail homocoupling of two CO2 units.
2-Pyrone synthesis by cycloaddition of CO2 to terminal alkynes (1-hexyne,
1-propyne) has also been investigated. This process can be catalytically promoted,
albeit with low yield and selectivity, by Co [74] and Rh [75] complexes. Rh(dppe)
(η6-BPh4), in acetonitrile, at 390 K, catalyzed the formation of 4,6-dimethyl-2-
pyrone from 1-propyne and CO2 (1 MPa) with a TON of 50 [75]. The Rh-catalyzed
reaction has been proposed to proceed through a mechanism (Scheme 5.15) not
involving an oxametallacycle intermediate species. The CO2 insertion into the Rh–
C(sp2)-σ-bond of a Rh-alkenyl intermediate, obtained upon propyne dimerization,
affords a linear unsaturated carboxylate which is converted into the pyrone.

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
The synthesis of 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrone from 1-propyne and CO2 (6 MPa,
403 K) was achieved by Pillai et al. using Rh4- or Fe2Rh4-carbonyl cluster-derived
catalysts, supported on selected metal oxides such as TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 [76,
77]. Formation of 2-pyrone was accompanied by homocoupling by-products such
as 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. In the absence of CO2 only the trimethyl-
benzenes were produced. FTIR studies indicated that a key intermediate in the
formation of pyrone may be a monodentate carbonate absorbed on the catalyst
surface [77].

Carboxylation of Allenes
Also allenes undergo stoichiometric 1:1 coupling reaction with CO2 in the presence
of LnNi(0) complexes (L ¼ bpy, dcpe, dppe, DBU, PCy3) [10, 78]. Pioneering
studies by Hoberg [78] showed that the coupling reaction involves the carbon
atom of CO2 and the C(sp) atom of diene moiety and generates a conjugated ﬁve-
membered nickelacyclic carboxylate, which shows a Ni–C(sp3) bond (Scheme 5.16,
route (a)). With substituted 1,2-dienes, such as CH2¼C¼CR1R2 (R1 ¼ H, alkyl;
R2 ¼ alkyl),
two

ﬁve-membered
oxanickelacycles
were
produced
(Scheme 5.17). The metallacyclic carboxylates can be converted into the
corresponding carboxylic acid methyl esters upon protonolysis with HCl/MeOH.
This stoichiometric chemistry has been revisited in the last few years [60, 79–82]
and, for instance, applied to the synthesis of α-methylene-γ-hydroxy carboxylic
acids and their derivatives (cis-β,γ-disubstituted α-methylene-γ-lactones) by means

Unsaturated carboxylic acid magnesium salts have been obtained catalytically
by reductive electrocarboxylation of a number of allenes with a LnNi(II)-complex

catalyst, in the presence of a sacriﬁcial magnesium anode [46, 83] (see also
Sect. 5.3).However, regioselectivity was moderate. In addition to α,β-unsaturated
acids, the process afforded vinyl acetic acid derivatives, involving carboxylation of
a terminal carbon of allene moiety, and di-carboxylic acids. Catalytic double
164

Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
carboxylation of trimethylsilylallenes has also been achieved using Ni(0)/DBU as
catalytic system and dimethyl zinc as trans-metalation/reducing agent [84].
The above catalytic processes are still based on Ni(0)-promoted oxidative cou-
pling of substrate with CO2 (Schemes 5.16 and 5.17). A new successful different
approach, allowing the synthesis of β,γ-unsaturated carboxylic acids from allenes
and CO2, has been reported by Iwasawa [85, 86]. The protocol requires the use of a
tridentate silyl pincer palladium hydride complex as the active catalyst in the
presence of a suitable reducing agent (Scheme 5.18) and is based on the generation
of a σ-allyl palladium species via hydropalladation of allene substrate, followed
by
its
nucleophilic
addition
to
CO2.
The
catalyst
precursor
(X ¼ triﬂuoromethanesulfonate in Scheme 5.18) is converted into a palladium
hydride by trans-metalation with Et3Al (or Et2Zn), followed by β-elimination.
Hydrometalation of the less sterically congested double bond of the allene moiety
generates a σ-allyl Pd-complex. The tridentate structure of the silyl pincer ligand
(PSiP) stabilizes the allyl group in the σ- rather than π-coordination mode and
enhances the nucleophilicity of the σ-allyl palladium intermediate, because of the
strong electron-donating nature and trans-inﬂuence of the silicon atom at the center
of the tridentate pincer backbone. The σ-allyl palladium intermediate undergoes
nucleophilic addition to CO2 at the γ-position of palladium regioselectively to give,
upon allylic transposition, a palladium carboxylate. The latter species can undergo a
second trans-metalation and β-elimination with Et3Al or Et2Zn to regenerate the
catalytically active Pd-hydride species and affords the aluminum or zinc salt of the
β,γ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The free acid was generated upon protonolysis. The
pincer structure of the PSiP ligand helps to retard the liberation of Pd(0) and to avoid
side reactions such as oxidative cyclization of allenes, usually promoted by Pd(0).

To
date,
little
information
is
available
in
the
literature
on
catalytic
co-oligomerization of allenes with CO2. Allene and CO2 can react in the presence
of palladium catalysts to yield linear esters (A and B, Structure 5.3) as the main
carboxylated products, together with lower amounts of 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrone (C,
Structure 5.3) and a mixture of allene linear oligomers and polymers [87].
Pyrone formation is reminiscent of cyclooligomerization of alkynes (see
Sect. 5.4), suggesting that allene might initially be isomerized to 1-propyne.
However, an ad hoc experiment, involving propyne as the substrate, showed pyrone
formation in very minor amounts and demonstrated that linear esters A and
B (Structure 5.3) were not formed in this way. It has been suggested that the
formation of the linear esters (and oligomers) may imply a hydrogen-transfer step
which presumably proceeds through the intermediacy of a palladium hydride.
In aromatic solvents, allene and CO2 reacted in the presence of Rh(dppe)(η6-
BPh4) to yield pyrone C (Structure 5.3) besides 1.2.1.2-polyallene and a small
amount of oligomers [88]. On the basis of the lack of reactivity of 1-propyne with
CO2, under conditions similar to those used for allene, the possibility that pyrone
formation could imply a preliminary isomerization of allene to the alkyne can also
be excluded in this case. It is worth noting that the pyrone formation requires an

Scheme 5.19 Rh-catalyzed formation of 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrone
initial head-to-tail (H–T) coupling of two allene units, which may be promoted by
the metal center if two cis positions are made available in the coordination sphere of
rhodium, which is coordinatively saturated in Rh(dppe)(η6-BPh4). This may occur
at the working temperature (373 K), which favors the change of coordination sphere
around the metal center, making possible the coordination of substrate followed by
the H–T homocoupling step (Scheme 5.19). Subsequent isomerization of
rhodacycle A (Scheme 5.19) to metallacycle B and reaction of the latter species
with CO2 can reasonably account for the formation of 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrone.
Carrying out the reaction in the presence of a base, used as a co-catalyst, promoted
the formation of the linear ester A (Structure 5.3) and 1.2.2.1-polyallene, both
requiring head-to-head coupling of allene units. The presence of a base
co-catalyst caused a modiﬁcation of the catalytic system because of formation of
complex (dppe)Rh–Ph by phenyl transfer from boron to rhodium [89, 90]. Homo-
lytic cleavage of the Rh–phenyl bond can afford rhodium radical species which
have been proposed to initiate the observed H–H polymerization of substrate,
as well as the formation of the precursor of the linear ester A (Structure 5.3). The
formation of the linear ester A requires an external source of hydrogen, which may
come from solvent. Accordingly, a signiﬁcant solvent effect was observed and, in
contrast with toluene, dichloromethane favored the formation of homopolymers.
Nickel(0) catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with allene has been reported
to form 3-methyl-4-methylene-2-pentene-5-olide in 20 % yield [91]. Scheme 5.20
(L ¼ dppe) summarizes the proposed mechanism. Insertion of CO2 into a nickela-
cyclopentane intermediate (A, in Scheme 5.20) affords a π-allyl-nickel carboxylate,
from which 3,4-dimethylenepentane-5-olide can be reductively eliminated.

Isomerization of the latter species to the ﬁnal product may be driven by the more
extended conjugation of diene moiety with carbonyl group. Nickelacyclopentane
species, such as A in Scheme 5.20, have been isolated and shown to form π-allyl-
nickel carboxylates upon reaction with CO2 [87].

Scheme 5.20 Ni-catalyzed cycloaddition of allene with CO2
A different regiochemistry has been observed by Tsuda [92] in the cycloaddition
of CO2 with methoxyallene. The cooligomerization process was catalyzed by
Pd2(dba)3
.CHCl3/(n-Bu)2PCH2CH2Py
(dba ¼ dibenzylideneacetone;
Py ¼ 2-
pyridyl). The reaction afforded (E)-5-methoxy-2-(methoxymethylene)-4-methy-
lene-5-olide regio- and stereo-speciﬁcally. The methoxy substituent plays a crucial
role in this reaction, as 1,2-pentadiene did not produce any co-oligomer with CO2 in
the presence of the same catalytic system. It has been proposed that the electron-
donating methoxy group may favor the formation of a palladium metallacyclic
intermediate (Structure 5.4) by conjugation with the electron-withdrawing carbon
of the carbonyl group.
The reaction of allene with carbon dioxide, using trans-[RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2
as catalyst, has allowed an unprecedented reactivity to be emphasized [93]. Com-
plex [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2 is an active catalyst of allene H–T polymerization.
Extended studies by Aresta’s group have shown that the incidence of this process
can be controlled either working at high temperatures, or at low temperature but in
presence of H2, which, by acting as a mass regulator, can repress the polymer

formation in favor of oligomeric products. With a view to favoring allene-CO2
coupling, avoiding the formation of polymers, the allene/CO2 cooligomerization
reaction has been investigated under CO2 pressure (6 MPa), in the presence of H2
(0.030.1 MPa), at temperatures just above room temperature (300–310 K). Under
the above conditions, complex [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2 promoted, albeit in very low
yield, the formation of four-membered lactone 3-methylene-2-oxetanone (D, Struc-
ture 5.3), which is the product of formal [2 + 2] addition of allene to CO2. It should
be noted that this product was never observed when allene was reacted with CO2 in
absence of H2. Moreover, it was not found when working in the presence of
hydrogen at temperatures higher than 320 K. The formation of the new heterocyclic
product can be related to a modiﬁcation of the starting catalyst [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-
Pr)3]2, which in the presence of hydrogen has been shown to convert easily into
[RhH2(Cl)P(i-Pr3)]2. The new hydride species is believed to react with allene to
afford a reactive intermediate which is able to couple with CO2.
The non-catalyzed combination of the two cumulenes has been investigated
from a theoretical point of view [93–95]. The calculations have shown that CO2
and allene may undergo a [2 + 2] addition reaction affording 3-methylene-2-
oxetanone, as well as diketene. Energetics for the formation of both species are
not very favorable, with 3-methylene-2-oxetanone being the isomer highest in
energy. The Rh-hydride catalysis may circumvent the energy barrier and allow
the formation of the lactone through a different reaction pathway.

Carboxylation of Conjugated Dienes
Stoichiometric carboxylation of conjugated dienes with CO2 has been carried out in
the presence of both late (Ni, Fe) and early (Zr) low valent transition metal systems
[1–10, 48, 96–102]. Depending on the nature of the metal center, ancillary ligands,
diene substrate, and, more generally, working conditions, the carboxylation reac-
tion may evolve in different ways and afford metal-carboxylate products implying
1:2 or 1:1 or 2:1 CO2/1,3-diene coupling, which are useful synthones for further
reactions with electrophiles. For instance, butadiene, which is η4-coordinated to
iron(0) in (Me3P)3Fe(C4H6), can react with CO2 to give, according to the experi-
mental conditions, either the mono- or the 1,4-dicarboxylated product [10,
96]. Yasuda et al. [97] studied the reaction of CO2 with a series of Zr-diene
complexes of the type ZrL2(s-cis-diene) and ZrL2(s-trans-diene) (L ¼ η5-C5H5,
η5-C5Me5; diene ¼ butadiene, isoprene). The course of the carboxylation reaction
was found to be markedly affected by the bulkiness of the auxiliary ligands and the
geometry (s-cis, s-trans) of ligated dienes.
However, most studies have dealt with Ni(0)-based systems [1–10, 48, 98–
102]. The reactivity of conjugated dienes with Ni(0)-complexes and carbon dioxide
is higher than that exhibited by monoenes. Accordingly, the reaction of Ni(bpy)
(cod) with CO2 and 1,3,7-octatriene yielded products which indicate that CO2
attacks only at the diene moiety of octatriene [101].
5.6
Carboxylation of Conjugated Dienes

In the presence of monodentate P-ligands, Ni(0) promoted the CO2/1,3-diene
coupling in a 1:2 ratio to yield a Ni(II)-C9-carboxylate. This behavior reﬂects the
well-recognized ability of Ni(0)-complexes bearing labile phosphane ligands to
promote oleﬁn oligomerization. In fact, the above carboxylation reactions are
usually believed to imply, as the ﬁrst step, the linkage of two diene units to form
a bis-allyl-C8 chain, followed by CO2 insertion into a Ni-allyl σ-bond to afford Ni
(II)-carboxylates, which may undergo further rearrangements reactions. By using P
(O-i-Pr)3 as ancillary ligand, Hoberg succeeded in obtaining 2-methylene-3-
vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2 even catalytically,
albeit in low yield and with a low turnover (TON ¼ 29 cycles) [98]. Mori has
enlarged the scope of the Ni(0)-promoted 1:2 CO2/1,3-diene coupling reaction,
using bis-1,3-dienes as the substrates [99]. She found that the system Ni(0)/PPh3
catalyzed, under very mild conditions, the addition of CO2 and organozinc to
bis-1,3-dienes (Scheme 5.21). The reaction resulted in the carboxylative cyclization
of the bis-1,3-diene moiety with high regio- and stereoselectivity. This process was
further developed into an enantioselective asymmetric reaction by using a chiral P,
O chelating ligand [100].
CO2/diene coupling in a 1:1 ratio to give η3-allyl-C5-carboxylate Ni-complexes
(Scheme 5.22) has been shown to be possible in the presence of P- or N-chelating
ligands [1–10, 101]. A few η3-allyl-C5-carboxylate-Ni-complexes have also been
structurally characterized [9]. Although η3-coordination of the allyl moiety is
thermodynamically more stable compared

to the η1-bonding mode, an η3–η1 rearrangement of the oxo-π-allyl intermediate
formed by diene-CO2 oxidative coupling is also possible and can be envisaged to
account for the formation of α,ω-dicarboxylate complexes, which have been
reported in a few cases (Scheme 5.22; M ¼ Fe [96], Zr [97], Ni [101]). Remarkably,
only 1,4- and no 1,2-dicarboxylation has been observed. Mori [102] has shown that
DBU is a superior ligand for nickel(0)-promoted oxidative coupling of dienes with
CO2. In the presence of the amidine ligand (2 equiv.), Ni(cod)2 (1 equiv.) promoted
the 1:1 oxidative coupling of 4-phenyl-1,3-butadiene with carbon dioxide under
mild conditions (273 K, 0.1 MPa CO2 pressure) in short times (4 h). The process can
also run in the presence of an excess of organozinc reagents, acting as reducing and
trans-metalation agents. Interestingly, depending on the nature of the organozinc
compound, mono- or 1,4 dicarboxylated products can be obtained [102].
Schindler et al. carried out a kinetic analysis for the reaction of isoprene (ip) with
carbon dioxide and Ni(bpy)(cod) [103]. Ni(bpy)(cod) did not react directly with
CO2 (see also Sect. 5.2), but reacted reversibly with isoprene to give Ni(bpy)(ip).
The kinetic results support a mechanism where, in a fast preequilibrium step, one of
the bonds between Ni and cod is cleaved and, in a following step, ip coordinates to
the free coordination site (Scheme 5.23). At low temperatures Ni(bpy)(ip) can
further react, through a consecutive equilibrium, with another ip molecule to give
Ni(bpy)(ip)2. However, in the presence of CO2, the nickel–ip complex, Ni(bpy)(ip),
reacts irreversibly with the heterocumulene to form the product complex (3-5-η3)-
3-methyl-3-pentenylato)nickel bipyridine (Scheme 5.23). The activation para-
meters for the latter step were calculated to be ΔH{ ¼ 25  7 kJ/mol and
ΔS{ ¼ 184  24 J/(mol K). The large negative activation entropy indicates that
the carboxylation reaction proceeds in an associative way, during which CO2

is inserted into a Ni–C bond in an oxidative coupling step. Therefore, also in this
case, the carboxylation reaction seems to involve the activation of the substrate
(ip) rather than CO2. Only after diene activation can a reaction with CO2 take place.
As already noted for alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, an alternative route to the
one-to-one coupling of conjugated dienes with the heterocumulene, which allows
bypassing of the oxidative coupling step between the two substrates, can be
provided by the hydrocarboxylation pathway, involving hydrometalation of conju-
gated diene to give a π-allyl–metal complex, followed by reaction with CO2 [104,
105]. Recently, the hydropalladation route explored by Iwasawa and coworkers for
the catalytic carboxylation of allenes (see Sect. 5.5 and Scheme 5.18) has also been
exploited successfully by the same research group for the catalytic carboxylation of
conjugated 1,3-dienes, using the same PSiP-pincer type palladium complex
described in Scheme 5.18 as catalyst precursor and AlEt3 as reducing/trans-
metalation agent. The protocol provided a very useful method for the synthesis of
β,γ-unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives through efﬁcient one-to-one coupling of
1,3-dienes with CO2 [105].
In the presence of transition metal (Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh) catalysts, conjugated dienes
can also cooligomerize with carbon dioxide. The ﬁrst studies on catalytic
cooligomerization of 1,3-dienes with CO2 date back to the end of the 1970s and
172
5
Interaction of CO2 with C–C Multiple Bonds
were carried out by Inoue [106] and Musco [107], who succeeded in synthesizing
lactones and linear esters, albeit in low yield. Since then, several studies [1–9] have
been conducted by different research groups with the aim of improving both yield
and selectivity of these reactions and rationalizing the reaction mechanism.
The best results in terms of activity and selectivity have been achieved using
1,3-butadiene as the substrate in the presence of Pd-based catalytic systems. Behr’s
group [6, 108–112] studied in detail the cooligomerization of butadiene with CO2,
throwing light on the conditions leading to the synthesis of δ-lactone 2-ethylidene-
6-heptene-5-olide (1, Scheme 5.24), the most representative of the products which
can form in this process. The formation of 1 is accompanied by that of other
by-products, such as 2-ethylidene-5-heptene-4-olide (2) and its conjugated isomer
2-ethyl-2,4-heptadiene-4-olide (3), linear esters 4 and 5, and diene oligomers
(Scheme 5.24). The distribution of the products depends on the working conditions
and is markedly affected by temperature. For instance, using the catalytic system Pd
(acac)2/P(i-Pr)3 [6], it was found that the formation of lactone 1 was very selective
at low temperatures (333–343 K), but yields were low. The selectivity decreased
with increasing temperature because of formation of esters and diene oligomers.
However, above 403 K only oligomers of butadiene were observed. The synthesis
of lactone 1 has been optimized and developed to miniplant scale [110–112]. The
selectivity to the δ-lactone has been increased above 95 % by recycling of
by-products, reaching an overall butadiene conversion of 45 %. Moreover, solvent,
unreacted starting materials, and catalyst can also be recycled, affording a stable
process which is ready for industrial exploitation. δ-Lactone 1 is a richly
functionalized molecular system which may ﬁnd practical utilization in numerous
synthetic applications [109]. This compound has proved to be a versatile synthone
for further reactions, leading to the synthesis in high yields of interesting products,
such as acids, alcohols or diols, aldehydes, amino acids or amines, esters, silanes,
and even polymers.
Scheme 5.24 summarizes the catalytic cycle leading to the formation of
δ-lactone 1, as well as the other observed by-products. The cycle also applies to
Ni- and Ru-based catalysts, which, however, exhibited poor catalytic activity.
The catalytically active species is a palladium(0) complex stabilized by a tertiary
phosphine, which is formed initially in situ from a palladium(II) precursor. Very
interesting yields and selectivities to δ-lactone have been achieved by using cata-
lytic systems based on Pd(acac)2 and phosphines with good σ-donor properties and
bulky substituents, such as P(i-Pr)3 or PCy3. It is worth noting that these ligands,
which are very active in the synthesis of δ-lactone, contain a CHR2 group adjacent
to the phosphorus atom. It has been suggested that this group may be involved in the
activation of the heterocumulene [6].
The ﬁrst step is butadiene dimerization by oxidative coupling of two diene
molecules to give a bis-η3-allylpalladium complex A which may exist in equilib-
rium with the η3,η1 isomer A0. Direct coupling of CO2 with a diene molecule is not a
competitive reaction at this stage, as the diene dimerization is faster at the Pd
(0) center. Complex A0 can eliminate 1,3,7-octatriene or insert CO2 into the Pd–C
σ-bond to give an allylic C9-Pd-carboxylate B. The latter species can undergo
5.6
Carboxylation of Conjugated Dienes
173
reductive elimination to give δ-lactone 1 or convert into γ-lactone 2, which can
isomerize to the more conjugated γ-lactone 3. The reductive elimination step
affording δ-lactone 1 is reversible, as 1 can oxidatively add to Pd and regenerate
the allylic Pd-carboxylate B from which γ-lactones 2 and 3 can form. Accordingly,
the same catalytic systems able to promote the formation of 1 from butadiene and
CO2 also catalyze the isomerization of δ-lactone 1 to γ-lactones 2 and 3. The latter
reaction, which is somewhat facilitated at higher temperatures and catalyst concen-
trations, indicates that, under the conditions used in the cooligomerization reaction
(353–363 K; 8–15 h), δ-lactone 1 is a kinetic product, as the formation of this
species is kinetically preferred over that of the thermodynamically more stable
γ-lactones 2 and 3. The key intermediate in the catalytic cycle is the allylic
C9-palladium-carboxylate B. This species is also an intermediate in the formation
of the linear esters because it can react with two other butadiene molecules to give
4 and 5. Accordingly, a mixture of the esters 4 and 5 has been obtained by reacting
δ-lactone 1 with an excess of butadiene in the presence of the catalytic system Pd
(acac)2/P(i-Pr)3.

Scheme 5.24 Pd-catalyzed cooligomerization of butadiene with CO2: reaction mechanism
(adapted from [109])
The presence of nitrile groups in the reaction medium markedly facilitates the
formation of δ-lactone 1. In fact, the cooligomerization process proceeded satis-
factorily in nitrile solvents, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, and benzonitrile,
whereas butadiene oligomers formed mainly when solvents such as toluene, ace-
tone, and THF were employed. It has been proposed that nitrile molecules can
stabilize the catalytically active Pd(0)/phosphine system through the formation of a
labile Pd(NCR)x(PR3)y complex. The nitrile ligands are less tightly bound to the
metal center than phosphine ligands and, therefore, can more easily generate free
174

coordination sites for the coordination of diene. Based on this “nitrile-effect,” Pitter
and coworkers have designed and prepared new hemi-labile phosphino-nitrile
ligands, R2P(CH2)n–CN, which increased the versatility of the catalytic system,
allowing one to carry out the catalytic process in solvents other than nitriles or also
in solvent-free conditions [113, 114]. Behr and coworkers have recently explored
the use of organic carbonates as reaction solvents as an alternative to toxic aceto-
nitrile for the cooligomerization of butadiene with CO2 [112]. Cyclic carbonates,
such as ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, and glycerol
carbonate, facilitated the formation of lactone 1 much more than linear carbonates,
such as dimethyl- or diethyl carbonate. Very interesting conversions were observed,
with selectivities depending on the size of the substituents in the carbonate
molecule.
The cooligomerization process can also be promoted by Rh catalysts [108,
115]. However, in the presence of neutral or ionic complexes of Rh(I) or Rh(III)
as catalyst precursors (for instance, the system (C2H4)2Rh(acac)/PEt3), γ-lactone
2-ethyl-2,4,9-undecatriene-4-olide (6) was isolated, in

A few plausible reaction pathways for the formation of C13-γ-lactone 6 have
been summarized in Scheme 5.25. A C12-bis-η3-allyl-complex is initially formed by
reaction of the starting Rh-complex with three butadiene molecules. This interme-
diate may further insert CO2 into the terminal allyl moiety to give a C13-carboxyl-
ate-Rh-complex C. Upon H-shift, C can isomerize to intermediate D, from which
C13-γ-lactone 6 can be released by reductive elimination. However, a parallel path
may also be operative wherein a C8-bis-allyl Rh-species is initially formed. This
species can react, to a certain extent, with CO2 to give the C9-carboxylate-Rh-
complex E, which can further react with the diene to give the ﬁnal product. It is
worth noting that the C9-Rh-carboxylate E is analogous to intermediate B in
Scheme 5.24. Therefore, the intermediacy of E can easily explain not only the
formation of the observed carboxylated by-products 1-3, but also the formation of
γ-lactone 6 from δ-lactone 1 and butadiene (Scheme 5.25).

Reaction Mechanisms in the
Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols, Polyols,
Cyclic Ethers, and Cyclic Amines to Afford
Monomeric Compounds and Polymeric
Materials
Abstract This chapter deals with the utilization of CO2 in the carboxylation of
alcohols, diols, polyols, and epoxides to create a variety of compounds such as
linear carbonates, cyclic monomeric carbonates, and polycarbonates. Homo-
geneous, heterogenized, and heterogeneous catalysts are described. The problem
of “water elimination” is considered and routes for water-trapping discussed. DFT
calculations used to support the reaction mechanism are presented with the identi-
ﬁed transition states relevant to various mechanistic scenarios.
6.1
Utilization of Organic Carbonates and Conventional
Synthetic Routes
Molecular acyclic (Structure 6.1a) and cyclic (Structure 6.1b) organic carbonates
are expected to experience a considerable expansion of their market during the
coming years because of their use in the chemical (as solvent and reagent [1]),
pharmaceutical (as intermediates [2, 3]), and polymer industries [4] (Fig. 6.1).
The lower members of the acyclic carbonate family, namely dimethyl-carbonate
(DMC) and diethylcarbonate (DEC), have been proposed as components of gaso-
line [6]. Considering the percentage they can reach in gasoline (up to 5–7 %), it is
foreseeable that their free market may face a growth of more than two orders of
magnitude from the actual 0.1 Mt year1 [7, 8]. It is useful to point out that most of
the DMC actually produced is for captive use in the industry of polycarbonates:
only ~10 % is on the market. To satisfy market demand, new synthetic technologies
need to be developed that are not based on the use of phosgene (6.1), which is
banned in several countries and cannot be transported [9, 10].

Safer and environmentally friendly synthetic methodologies, either CO-, CO2-, or

are on stream (oxidative carbonylation of methanol) or close to commercialization
(urea chemistry). Noteworthy, the oxidative carbonylation better suits methanol
than higher alcohols. The technology has been developed by ENIChem [11–15]
(6.2) and UBE [16] (6.3), each having drawbacks that have prevented the develop-
ment to a large scale exploitation.

The trans-esteriﬁcation of other carbonates is also used (6.4) [17], which mainly
uses ethene carbonate (6.4) prepared from ethene epoxide (the industrial process
needs improvement) and CO2 (6.5) [18, 19].

The direct carboxylation of alcohols (6.6) and the reaction of alcohols with urea
(used as an active form of CO2) (6.7) represent appealing alternatives. The former
has some kinetic and thermodynamic barriers, the latter raises NH3 recovery issues
and product separation problems.

Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols
Because of their Gibbs free energy (see below), reaction (6.6) is shifted to the left
much more than reaction (6.7). As a matter of fact, the literature shows that the
equilibrium concentration of DMC in reaction (6.6) (R ¼ Me) is less than 1 %,
depending on the reaction temperature [20], whereas in reaction (6.7) it can easily
exceed 20 %. Other alcohols, such as ethanol and allyl alcohol [21], show an
analogous behavior. Unfavorable thermodynamics is not the only drawback of
reaction (6.6): the water formed in the reaction pushes the equilibrium to the left
and affects the catalyst structure and activity [20, 22, 23] in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous processes: water traps have been used, either chemical- or process-
based, and are discussed in Sect. 6.2.2.3.
6.2.1
Thermodynamic and Kinetic Issues
Let us start with a general consideration of (6.6). It formally implies the following
elementary reactions:
1. Breaking of two O–H bonds in two alcohol molecules
2. Formation of two O–H bonds in water
3. Breaking of two C–O bonds in CO2
4. Formation of two CO bonds in the carbonate

where r is the reaction; f the formation of a bond; and d the dissociation of bond.
Because the same number of O–H bonds are formed and cleaved, and two O–C
bonds are cleaved and formed, despite different kinds of bonds being implied, one
can foresee that the overall enthalpy effect is almost neutral and depends on the
difference of energy of a double C¼O bond with respect to two single C–O bonds
and by the different dissociation-formation energy of O–H bonds in water and
alcohols. If aromatic compounds are used, then the presence of the aromatic ring
with respect to the aliphatic group makes a difference to enthalpy. Conversely, one
can foresee that the entropic factor may play a more signiﬁcant role than ΔH, as
gaseous CO2 is converted into condensed phase CO2-containing products, and the
effect is the same for all reactions, should it be either an aliphatic or an aromatic
derivative. In summary, the enthalpy effect is driven by the nature of the alcohol,
although the entropic effect is driven by CO2.
If a liquid alcohol is reacted with gaseous CO2 to afford liquid carbonates and
liquid water, reaction (6.6) has a negative enthalpy of reaction if R is an alkyl group.
Conversely, when R is an aromatic moiety, ΔH is positive (see Table 6.1). By
applying the equation that correlates the thermodynamic quantities: Gibbs free
energy-enthalpy-entropy of reaction-temperature (6.9), one can calculate the
value of ΔG, considering that ΔS is equal to ~34 kcal mol1 for the various
reactions. Temperature also plays a role; an increase makes the product (TΔS)
more negative and ΔG becomes more positive.
ΔG ¼ ΔH  TΔS

As a result of the unfavorable thermodynamics, the equilibrium concentration of the
formed carbonate turns out to be quite low, often around 1 % or even less,
depending on the reaction temperature, which usually is in the range 400–450 K
for a metal-catalyzed reaction. Keeping the temperature as low as possible is a key
issue in this reaction.

Reaction Mechanisms in the Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols, Polyols. . .
However, super-active catalysts are necessary to carry out the reaction at the
lowest temperature, hopefully in the range 300–350 K or lower. Another approach
used, discussed later, is the coupling of two reactions: the carboxylation of alcohols
and a strongly exergonic reaction that together may produce an overall negative
ΔG. The exergonic reaction often used is the hydration of an organic substrate, such
as (1) multiple C–N bonds (cyanides, carbodiimides); (2) stressed rings; (3) reactive
acetals or ketals or orthoesters. Obviously such partner reactions need to be
associated in equimolar amounts to the carboxylation and the effect is that one
often gains in conversion of alcohols but loses in post-conversion treatment, as the
separation of the products may not be easy and requires energy. Additionally, the
formed carbonates (which are good alkylating or carboxy-alkylating agents; see
below) can react with the new formed species with an overall loss of selectivity,
thus possibly producing no net beneﬁt. It is worth recalling that the CO2-based
chemistry targets sustainability and reduction of C-footprint of synthetic processes:
such targets cannot be missed. To reduce the effect of the entropic factor, the
carboxylation reaction can be carried out in supercritical CO2 (scCO2). To be
effective, the reactive system must be in a single phase. Alternatively, high CO2
pressure is used using liquid alcohols as reaction medium. In fact, if one operates at
a pressure of 300 MPa, the reaction is shifted to the right: such operative conditions
are not sustainable.
It has been mentioned that water trapping using reactive species may help the
thermodynamics of the system but can generate negative effects on the composition
of the reaction mixture. Water can also be trapped by using chemico-physical
techniques, which do not modify the reactive system, as discussed in Sect. 6.2.2.3.
From the kinetic point of view, it must be said that the bond-cleavages involved
in the reactive systems are all quite energetic [24]. This results in a global process
which has kinetic barriers to overcome. The use of a catalyst can inﬂuence such
parameter. It has been said in Chap. 4 that CO2 inserts quite rapidly in an M–O
bond: therefore the formation of an M–OR bond has an overall kinetic relevance
(through activation of the RO–H bond and M–OR bond formation) although the
insertion of CO2 into the M–OR bond to afford M–OC(O)OR is rapid. The
following reaction of cleavage of the M–OC(O)OR bond by reaction with a second
molecule of alcohol and formation of M–OH and (RO)2C¼O also plays a role in the
overall kinetics. The M–OH species has then to be converted again into M–OR for
further reaction to occur. Alternatively, it is possible that the M–OR species is
formed in the direct reaction of M–OC(O)OR with two molecules of alcohols [25],
an aspect discussed in this chapter.
6.2.2
Reaction Mechanism
In a catalyst-free process, the direct carboxylation of alcohols requires, a priori, two
distinct steps as categorized in Scheme 6.1. In (i) an alcohol molecule is activated
by a base and an alkoxo-moiety is generated which interacts (ii) with CO2 affording
the hemi-carbonate, RO–C(O)O. The acid activation of the second molecule of
alcohol (iii) produces the alkyl moiety which reacts with the hemi-carbonate and
6.2

generates the dialkylcarbonate. Interestingly, the role of acid and base can be
played by a catalyst. Various kinds of catalysts are discussed in the following
sections and the known mechanisms are presented. The pathway presented in
Scheme 6.1 is not followed in all catalyzed processes and its occurrence depends
on the properties of the catalyst used.
6.2.2.1
Homogeneous and Heterogenized Catalysts
Tin-Based Catalysts Soluble metallorganic species of Sn(IV), namely n-dibutyl-
dialkoxostannanes, n-Bu2Sn(OR)2 (R ¼ methyl, ethyl, n-butyl) have been used as
catalysts in the synthesis of DMC or DEC. Early reports [26] say that, at 423 K
under 2.8 MPa CO2 pressure, DMC was produced using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
as a water chemical trap. Sn-catalysts were reported to show 100 % selectivity
towards DMC [27].

Ethanol was also converted into DEC using the same catalyst, but with a lower
conversion yield which can be explained in terms of the lower acidity of ethanol
(pKa ¼ 15.9) with respect to methanol (pKa ¼ 15.5). Ballivet and coworkers have
carried out studies [22, 23, 29–31] on the structural characterization of tin com-
pounds, in solution and in the solid-state after the ﬁrst cycle of reaction, and have
deﬁned the structure of the species formed from (CH3)2Sn(OCH3)2 1, n-Bu2Sn
(OCH3)2 2, and n-Bu2Sn[OCH(CH3)2]2 3 used as putative catalysts. Other authors
have used the same systems with different alkyl groups (see below). The
compounds isolated by Ballivet et al. from the reaction mixture are described
as resting species in the catalytic cycle (Structure 6.2).
Compound A is the product of monoinsertion of CO2 into Sn–OR bonds of 2.
DFT calculations have shown that the double CO2 insertion on 2 to afford n-Bu2Sn
[OC(O)OCH3]2 is thermodynamically possible [33], but such compounds were not
isolated nor their presence ascertained in the catalytic runs. When heated,
A converts into B and DMC via an intramolecular methyl-transfer mechanism.
Species B is very stable because of the formation of O–Sn–O bonds. The formation
of DMC requires that B reacts with external methanol, affording C. Moving from
A to C, the nuclearity of the complex increases from 2 to 4 and 10 Sn atoms with the

formation of extended Sn–O–Sn linkages. Eventually C can be recycled to afford
A which restarts the cycle: C is not the active catalyst. In A, B, and C the tin centers
are always penta-coordinated. The overall kinetics of the DMC formation is slow
because of the complex interconversion mechanism of the metal species active in
catalysis, which requires the cleavage and formation of energetic bonds, as men-
tioned above. Sc-CO2 has been used as solvent in such reactions [30, 31].

Niobium-Based Catalysts Other soluble alkoxides such as those of titanium
(IV) [27, 35, 36] and Group 5 metals [21, 28, 37] are active catalysts in the direct
carboxylation of alcohols. The reaction mechanism has been elucidated with penta-
alkoxo species of Group 5 elements [21, 28, 37] combining DFT and experimental
studies. The overall reaction mechanism is depicted in Scheme 6.2.
The niobium alkoxides are dimeric species, and they need to dissociate into the
monomeric species before CO2 can react. Such reaction depends on the solvent
used: alcohols favor the dissociation more than benzene. This is because of the
capacity of alcohols to assist the Nb–O bond cleavage in the dimer by coordinating
to Nb. However, alcohols can bind to the coordinatively unsaturated monomeric
Nb-alcoxo species formed upon dissociation, preventing their re-association. Such

pentacoordinated species can react with CO2 to afford the chelating hemicarbonate
Nb(OR)4(OCO2R) as thermodynamic product and the monodentate as kinetic
product and real catalyst [21, 28].
The curve of absorption of CO2 by the Nb-complexes in alcohol clearly shows
an induction time because of the dissociation of the dimer. Interestingly,
the dissociation is slower in benzene than in alcoholic solutions (kobs1 value of
1.15  105 s1 in ethanol and 0.97  105 s1 in benzene), accounting for the
solvating effect of the solvent (Fig. 6.2). The curve also shows that the reaction is
stopped when a molar ratio CO2/Nb ¼ 1 is reached, suggesting that only a mono-
alkylhemicarbonate species is formed. The reaction is ﬁrst order in the monomeric

From the determined kdiss and kobs, kcarb was calculated and found equal to ca. 103, a
value in line with what is reported in Sect. 4.4.
The active species is the Nb-monoalkylcarbonate which was isolated. The
alkylcarbonate exists as a stable chelating species in the solid state, as shown by
the FTIR data: bands at 1600 [vasym(OCOO)], 1414, 1330 [vsym (OCOO)] and
807 cm1. The IR data also suggest, for the ethyl carbonate group, an η2-coordi-
nation to the metal center through two O atoms.
In fact, the experimental value of Δv ¼ (vas – vsym) for the OCOO moiety has
been found to be 270 cm1, which is the correct value reported for bridging or
chelating OCOO moieties [38]. In benzene solution, the hemicarbonate is mono-
meric and monodentate [21], pointing thus to a chelating hemicarbonate in the solid
state. The conversion of the two forms (Scheme 6.3) is rapid. The formation of the
monodentate form is essential for catalysis to occur with dialkylcarbonates
formation.

Interestingly, when the solid Nb(OR)4(OCO2R) complex was heated, CO2 was
released (Scheme 6.1, left) and no formation of dialkylcarbonates was observed
[21]. Conversely, heating in the presence of alcohols, dialkylcarbonates were
produced, giving back the starting alkoxide complex. Nb–alkoxides thus show a
different behavior with respect to Sn–dialkoxo complexes.
Ruling out the intramolecular transfer of the methyl moiety, the formation of
dimethylcarbonate requires the intervention of external methanol. The reaction of
the (CH3O)4Nb(OCO2CH3) 3 in Scheme 6.4 with methanol can in principle occur
using one or two molecules of methanol, A and B in Scheme 6.4.
Two approaches were used to decide which is the most likely route: (1) DFT
calculations to model the reaction and ﬁnd the TS energy for the various possible
processes; (2) an experimental study on the inﬂuence of the molar ratio alcohol–
Nb–CO2 on the formation of carbonates.
It is worth emphasizing that, in principle, tri-molecular reactions (in the present
case, implying two molecules of methanol and the Nb-hemicarbonate moiety
as depicted in the green path in Scheme 6.4) are not entropically favored with
respect to bi-molecular reactions (one molecule of methanol reacting with one
Nb-hemicarbonate, fuchsia path in Scheme 6.4). Nevertheless, it has been calcu-
lated by DFT that the interaction of two molecules of methanol with a molecule of
Nb-hemicarbonate has more favorable ΔHR that may balance out the negative
entropic contributions [21, 28]. Using two (or more) molecules of alcohol in
such a solvolysis reaction bears to less stressed structures for the TS than when
using a single molecule: the energy difference can be as large as 25 kcal mol1
(see Sect. 6.2.2.3).
Scheme 6.4 shows the three possible routes of generation of DMC from
Nb-methylcarbonate. The blue route is ruled out by the fact that in the absence of
methanol DMC is not formed, the green route implies one molecule of methanol per
Nb, and the red route implies two molecules of methanol per Nb.

DFT calculations (Fig. 6.3) clearly show that the kinetically most favored route
involves two molecules of methanol per Nb center. This theoretical ﬁnding is supported
by the experimental observation that increasing the molar ratio CH3OH/Nb over
1 increases the rate of formation of DMC from (CH3O)4Nb–OC(O)OCH3 [25].
Importantly, the catalysts discussed above, similar to the Sn catalysts, require a
quite anhydrous medium as in the presence of water the [O¼Nb(OR)3]2 species is
formed, inactive in catalysis [21, 28, 37, 39]. The equilibrium concentration of the
dialkylcarbonates is in the range 0.5–2 %, depending on the reaction conditions and
the alcohols used.
Several other catalysts have been used, but details about the nature of
active species and about the reaction mechanism are lacking in the literature. We
mention here the work done by Sakakura [40]. Scheme 6.5 shows the catalytic cycle
proposed by the authors who have coupled Sn-systems to water-trapping organics.
The proposed mechanism, recalls the fundamental steps proposed by Ballivet
(see above) also if multinuclear Sn specie are only mentioned here but not isolated.
Again, carbon dioxide is inserted into the non-bridging Sn–O bond of dimeric
[R2Sn(OMe)2]2 to afford a dimeric methoxo-bridged dinuclear structure bearing
two carbonate moieties, each on a different Sn atom. Such a dimer does not undergo
a second CO2 insertion, even at high CO2 pressure (up to 6.0 MPa). The thermolysis
of the dinuclear carbonato-complex results in the formation of DMC in a reasonable
yield and a multinuclear Sn complex which reacts with methanol to afford the
starting dimer. The hemicarbonato complex is said to lose CO2 readily under an
N2 atmosphere, even at room temperature, to regenerate the methoxo complex.
The organic water traps allow the catalysts to be used for several cycles.

The recovery of the soluble monomeric catalyst (the Nb case) implies the
separation by evaporation of the alcohols. In the case of Sn, oligomers are formed
which slow down the process, but would be easily separated as they are not soluble.
Although the Nb catalysts maintain their activity for several cycles (Fig. 6.4), the
low concentration of dialkylcarbonates makes the recovery procedure an expensive
operation. This has suggested the preparation and use of heterogenized catalysts for
an easier recovery (separation by ﬁltration). The heterogenization can be imple-
mented in several different ways and can inﬂuence the activity of the catalyst. The
complexes can be supported on an inert material (inorganics such as silica [42],
alumina, aluminosilicates, etc.), inglobated into inert matrices (organic or inor-
ganic) or into cavities of a polymeric structure (organic polymers [39] or zeolites),
or linked to the surface of a catalyst with a “tether” (tethered catalysts [43]). The
latter technique is interesting because it leaves the catalytic center quite unaltered
from the point of view of the coordination sphere around the metal and avoids
strong interactions with the support which may change the properties of the metal
center. The immobilization of Sn complexes on mesoporous SBA-15 affords more
6.2
Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols
193
resistant catalysts than the starting molecular Sn catalysts [44]. Examples of
catalysts tethered on polymers are represented by polystyrene-grafted [39, 43]
organo-tin and Nb-alkoxo species (Fig. 6.7). They have been used in a batch or a
ﬂow reactor and were shown to have good recyclability and long activity. Although
easily recyclable, these systems need optimization for maximizing their activity.
The reaction mechanism has not been discussed in detail, but at least for
Nb-catalysts it seems to repeat the one observed with homogeneous catalysts, as
the condition of the metal center is not changed in the two cases (Structure 6.3).
Conversely, for the Sn-tethered complexes it is hard to think that the same behavior
observed with soluble complexes can hold.
In fact, the Sn-centers in the supported catalyst are no longer free to undergo
association through Sn–O–Sn bridges, as they are quite far away and in a different
environment. This aspect requires further investigation for clarifying the reaction
mechanism which operates in such cases.
6.2.2.2
Heterogeneous Catalysts
Taking into account what has been discussed above, it appears that heterogeneous
catalysts would be the best candidates to drive the carboxylation of alcohols. In this
paragraph their use is discussed and the known aspects of the reaction mechanisms
reported. The catalysts are divided into two classes: single-metal and multi-metal
catalysts.
Single-Metal Catalysts Metal oxides such as CeO2 [17, 46], ZrO2 [47], and TiO2
[48]which are non-soluble in the reaction medium (heterogeneous) have been used

in the direct carboxylation of alcohols (methanol and ethanol). ZrO2-based mate-
rials were active in the temperature range 400–440 K, showing a selectivity towards
DMC close to 100 % [17]. In order to increase the DMC yield, ZrO2 was modiﬁed
with H3PO4 [49, 50] or used as the mixed oxide Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 [51].
The attempt to design active catalysts is justiﬁed by the fact that if they were
active at lower temperature, the thermodynamics of the process would be improved
and the equilibrium conversion yield increased to more usable values. Therefore,
modiﬁcation of the oxides with phosphoric acid has been carried out in an attempt
to modify the acid/basic ratio of active sites. Very often, it has been observed that an
increase of catalyst activity is coupled with a lowering of the selectivity: the
conversion yield is improved but the lower selectivity raises the problem of the
cost of separation of the products. Examples of such unfortunate coincidences are
given for the following catalysts. Whereas ZrO2 is used at 440 K with a low yield
(<1 %) and selectivity close to 100 %, H3PW12O40/ZrO2 is active at 373 K, but
dimethylether-DME and CO are formed as by-products [49, 50, 52–54].

H3PW12O40/Ce0.1Ti0.9O2 provides a higher DMC yield at 443 K (2.5 %) [53, 54]
with respect to ZrO2 with a selectivity much lower than 100 % which correlates
with the higher number of acid and basic sites. Unsupported H3PMo12O40 and its
copper salt Cu1.5PMo12O40 are active at temperatures as low as 313–333 K under
atmospheric pressure of CO2 [56] but the DMC selectivity does not exceed 23 %.
DME, formaldehyde, and methyl formate are the other identiﬁed products.
The beneﬁt of a higher conversion is, thus, almost cancelled out by the loss in
selectivity, which implies energy-intensive post reaction separation processes
which makes the carboxylation of alcohols a net CO2 emitter, more than a CO2 user.
Jung and Bell using ZrO2, have proposed the reaction sequence summarized in
Scheme 6.6 [57] based on NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopic studies.
Surface Zr–O–Zr–OH groups were proposed to react with methanol to afford
water and the Zr–O–Zr–O–CH3 moiety. The catalyst behaves here as an acid. Then
CO2 insertion occurs, converting the methoxy fragment into the hemicarbonate
CH3OC(O)O–Zr–O–Zr species. A subsequent reaction with CH3OH is proposed to
lead to DMC. The question may arise whether a Brønsted or Lewis acid is required.
Observing that when the oxide was loaded with H3PO4 the activity of the catalyst
was increased [49, 50], it has been suggested that Brønsted acid sites are more
important than Lewis ones [52–54]. Single-metal oxides show an interesting cata-
lytic activity, but a drawback is represented by their deactivation. The reasons for
such deactivation were investigated in the case of CeO2. Figure 6.5 (blue curve)
shows that, after the ﬁrst cycle, the activity decreases, reaching a marginal conver-
sion of methanol/alcohol in a few cycles.
The degradation of commercial CeO2 was investigated through BET and XPS
studies [58] and it was shown that the loss of activity was caused by two factors:
(1) the decrease of the active surface during the reaction (BET decreased from 8.8
to 1.6 m2 g1) and (2) the reduction of the oxidation state of 18 % of surface cerium
atoms from Ce(IV) to Ce(III), a species inactive in catalysis. The size of the
196

particles of the catalyst also plays a key role: nano-sized ceria (5–10 nm) is more
active than micro-sized particles and more resistant to deactivation [58].
Mixed Oxides To improve the resistance and life of the CeO2 catalyst, mixed
oxides were prepared and studied. When commercial ceria was loaded with 3–
10 % alumina (Fig. 6.5, upper curves) the catalyst was stabilized and had a much
longer life [58].
Such improvement was because Al2O3, which is bound to the surface, as
demonstrated by the insurgence of a signal at 40 ppm produced by a
“pentacoordinated dispersed” Al species (Fig. 6.6) in the solid state 27Al NMR
spectrum [58], or dissolved in the very ﬁrst layers of ceria, prevents O-transfer to
species bound to the ceria surface and, thus, prevents the Ce(IV) to Ce(III) reduc-
tion, as proven by XPS studies [45, 58, 59].
XPS spectra of samples of CeO2 at t ¼ 0 and after use in catalysis show the
insurgence of signals caused by Ce(III), whereas the Al-loaded samples do not
show any Ce(III) signal after use in several catalytic runs. The reaction mechanism
was ascertained by a combination of spectroscopic (IR and multinuclear NMR)
experimental tests and DFT calculations. High temperature DRIFT studies on the
catalyst allowed the collection of information on the reactions occurring at the
surface under the different operative conditions and hemicarbonate species were
characterized, also showing that the Al/Ce mixed oxide, unlike CeO2, does not
oxidize methanol [45, 59] to formate. 13C NMR was useful to demonstrate both the
formation of S-OCH3 (S is the catalyst surface) moieties (signal at 48.5 ppm;
Fig. 6.7c) and the surface conversion of such moieties into S-OC(O)OCH3 (signal
at 54.2 ppm; Fig. 6.12c) upon admission of CO2.
The neat catalysts have no 13C signals (Fig. 6.7a). The low intensity signal of the
carbon of the hemicarbonate group –OC(O)O– is located at 160.5 ppm. By

The formation of DMC was then followed by combining DRIFT, NMR, and
GC-MS studies.
On the basis of what has been discussed above, the methyl transfer can in
principle occur through the interaction of the S-OC(O)OCH3 group with either a
methoxo moiety standing nearby on the surface of the catalyst or methanol present
in the gas phase. The former hypothesis was ruled out with speciﬁc studies in the
absence of gas-phase methanol (Scheme 6.7). Al2O3–CeO2 bearing both the –OCH3
and the –OC(O)OCH3 moieties was heated in absence of MeOH and DMC was not
revealed. Conversely, when methanol was admitted, the formation of DMC was
observed.
A DFT study has conﬁrmed that two molecules of methanol are involved in the
release of DMC and routes (e) and (f) in Scheme 6.6 are ruled out. Also, the
dependence of the rate of formation of DMC on the concentration of methanol
was conﬁrmed by experiments which did show that increasing the amount of
methanol above 1:1 molar ratio CH3OH/CH3OC(O)O causes an increase of the
rate of reaction, as the energy is lowered.
Al2O3- and Nb2O5-loaded ceria were compared in the carboxylation of ethanol.
It was found that Nb2O5 3 %/CeO2 mixed oxides are 50 % more active than the
relevant Al/Ce systems [45, 59, 60].

Water Removal Techniques
Water removal for shifting equilibrium in (Eq. 6.6) to the right and preserving the
catalysts has been attempted using both chemical water traps and physical means.
Chemical traps can be either organic species (acetals [61], ketals [62], easily
hydratable bonds such as cyanides [63], and imides) or inorganic materials
(zeolite-based materials). The former have the advantage that they can be used at
the same temperature of the reaction and make more negative the overall ΔG, as the
hydration is exergonic, allowing the reaction to occur at lower temperature and with
much better yields (see the case discussed below in the Organic Promoters para-
graph). Zeolites need to be used at low temperature (also 240 K) [64], otherwise their
acidic surface may decompose the carbonates at temperatures of >400 K, usually
used for the carboxylation of alcohols: this makes their use not energetically conve-
nient as the temperature swing (>400 K ! 240 K ! >400 K) requires energy which
is not always (completely) recoverable in the process. On the other hand, for
homogeneous (organic) water traps the drawback is that they are soluble in the
reaction medium and, thus, need to be recovered from the reaction mixture and
regenerated for re-use, otherwise stoichiometric use makes the direct carboxylation
of alcohols for the synthesis of carbonates economically unacceptable. Such post-
reaction processing requires energy and increases the economic and energetic cost of
the process. Moreover, it frequently happens that the addition of such species results
in a loss of selectivity, as parallel reactions may occur which consume the formed
carbonate. It is useful to recall at this point that dialkyl-, alkylaryl-, or diaryl-
carbonates behave as alkylating (arylating) or alkoxy (aryloxy) carbonylating agents
[65]. Among the organic species used as water traps, we mention acetals (e.g.,
2,2-dimethoxypropane, DMP) [61, 66], ketals [62], cyanides [63–66], and butene
oxide [63, 64, 66–71]. Among inorganic water traps we mention molecular sieves of
3 or 4 Å [72, 73]. A speciﬁc case of organic water traps, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-
DCC, which act as promoters of the reaction are further discussed in Sect. 6.2.2.3.
Pervaporation Membrane for Water Removal The use of pervaporation mem-
branes for water removal proposes a serious alternative which allows the water
separation to operate at the same reaction temperature without any loss in selecti-
vity. The Nb2O5 3–10 %/CeO2 catalyst has been used in a ﬂow reactor for several
days coupled to a pervaporation membrane for water elimination [60] (Fig. 6.8).
The use of supercritical conditions allowed a higher conversion of ethanol to be
reached with respect to using liquid ethanol pressurized with CO2. The use of
pervaporation membranes is by far the best performing technology for water
separation as it minimizes post-reaction separation costs and allows working in a
continuous mode.
With respect to homogeneous organic water traps, membranes avoid any post-
reaction processing of the reaction mixture and, with respect to inorganic traps, they
avoid the swift temperature change. With respect to both organic and inorganic water
traps, membranes save the energy necessary for the recycling of the hydrated species.

DCC was used as a water trap in the transition metal catalyzed synthesis of organic
carbonates from alcohols and CO2 [26]. It was shown later on [25] that DCC is able
to promote the synthesis of organic carbonates, even under much milder conditions
than transition metal systems, as justiﬁed by the quite negative hydration energy,
making its use as a water trap in conjunction with metal systems unseemly. The
reaction mechanism has been demonstrated (Scheme 6.8) and DFT calculations
have given the mechanistic details and the TSs energies (Fig. 6.9) [25, 74].
The ﬁrst step (addition of methanol to DCC) is formally analogous to the
addition of water to DCC. It may occur with the implication of one or two
(or even more) methanol molecules. Scheme 6.8 shows that the activation energy
of methanol addition is signiﬁcantly reduced in the trimolecular reaction.
Once isourea 2 is formed, a second alcohol molecule interacts via H-bonding
with the iminic nitrogen of 2 affording 4 (see Scheme 6.7) which is in equilibrium
with its more stable form 40, isolated in the solid state [28, 74]. The H-bond formed
between the methanol molecule and the iminic C¼N bond increases the nucleo-
philicity of the O-atom, enabling a favorable interaction with CO2 and giving rise to
the formation of the hemicarbonate, “ion-paired” with isourea (5 in Scheme 6.7).
The migration of the methyl group of isourea to the hemicarbonate anion OC(O)
OCH3 affords DMC 6 and urea 7. The net stepwise reactions are shown in (6.11a)
and (6.11b), and the overall reaction is shown in (6.12).

DFT calculations allowed one to ascertain that the precursor state of reaction
(6.11a) is a three-center adduct involving an initial weak CH3OHCO2 interaction
(the energy is 2.4 kcal mol1) which is enhanced by the CH3O  H  N ! CH3O
  H  N hydrogen shift (4, Scheme 6.7). As already said, the H-bonding increases
the negative charge on the methoxo-oxygen, causing the strengthening of the O–
CO2 bond. When CH3OD, instead of CH3OH, was reacted with isourea and CO2, an
isotopic effect equal to 1.8 was observed which conﬁrms that the H (D) transfer is
the rate-determining step [25]. The concerted mechanism of the proton shift and the
O–C bond formation is clearly borne out by the structure of the transition state
TSprot, in which the proton is between nitrogen and oxygen, whereas the O–CH3
bond distance is 1.79 Å and CO2 is bent (Scheme 6.9).
However, the presence of CO2 in the reaction medium converts the alkoxo- into
the hemicarbonate-species which is more stable than the former because of charge
delocalization over the two oxygen atoms of the ROCOO group. Calculations
carried out on the interaction of a methoxo anion with carbon dioxide show that
CO2 addition to CH3O anion occurs spontaneously (with no energy barrier), and
the formation of the CH3OCOO anion is exothermic by 40.4 kcal mol1, under-
lying the importance of stabilization introduced by the presence of CO2. The
protonation of the iminic-N of isourea weakens its O–CH3 bond as indicated by
the O–C bond distances in 4 and 5 (1.43 vs 1.46 Å, respectively). This favors the

(Scheme 6.10).

The quasi planar CH3 group is positioned between the two O-atoms, and the N–
HO hydrogen bond is much weaker than in the ion-pair. Because the migrating
CH3 group carries a positive charge, both components of 5 become neutral, and the
ﬁnal state is characterized as an H-bonded complex formed between the cis-trans
isomers of urea and DMC (76). The relative energies of the identiﬁed stationary
points are summarized in Fig. 6.10. Because of the ionic nature of 5, the solvent
effects play an important role in the energetics, and therefore the solvation energies
for the ﬁve stationary points were estimated in terms of the PCM model, and
corrected for solvent effects. As Fig. 6.11 shows, the two models provide rather
different energy proﬁles.
Although the gas-phase calculations predict the ion-pair to be well above
(+12.7 kcal mol1) the isourea-methanol-CO2 adduct, this step clearly becomes
energetically permitted (7.1 kcal mol1) in the solvated model causing, therefore,
the energy of TSmethyl shift to a much lower value.
The energy barriers for the two steps of the reaction are predicted to be 9.8 and
14.5 kcal mol1 (from 7.1 to 7.4 kcal mol1) with the solvated model, which are
reasonably low, and one may conclude that the two-step reaction mechanism
represents a conceivable low energy route between isourea-methanol-CO2 and
DMC + DCU. Furthermore, these results are consistent with the fact that the
reaction takes place faster in polar solvents, justifying the theoretical observation
204

that the stability of the ion-pair intermediate and the gap of the proton shift appear
to be sensitive to the polarity of the solvent.
Attempts to ﬁnd experimental evidence with NMR and IR studies successfully
supported the above mechanism. 40 could be clearly identiﬁed via both its 1H and
13C NMR spectra in CD3CN at 273 K which, respectively, showed the equivalence
of the two aminic protons in solution, as depicted in Scheme 6.11, and the
equivalence of the N-bonded carbon atoms of the cyclohexyl rings which are
non-equivalent in 3. If CO2 is added to a CD3CN solution containing 3 and
methanol in equimolar amounts, a new signal located at 3.41 ppm appears in the
1H NMR spectrum of the solution because of the proton of the methyl group of the
hemi-carbonate moiety. At 300 K no further change is observed within minutes, but
heating this solution to 330 K causes the fast appearance in the 1H NMR spectrum
of the typical DMC signal at 3.70 ppm.
IR cannot clearly conﬁrm the formation of 4:40, but when an acetonitrile solution
of methanol and isourea is exposed to CO2, a solid is slowly formed at 273 K,
showing in its IR spectrum bands at 1 530 and 1 283 cm1, attributed to the
symmetrical and asymmetrical carbonyl stretching of the methylcarbonate anion
CH3OC(O)O.
The position of the bands and the difference of 302 cm1 between the sym and
asym carbonyl stretching frequency conﬁrm that the methylcarbonate is not
monodentate and in the solid state behaves as a μ2-O,O bidentate ligand [21],
generating the stable form 50 shown in Scheme 6.12. 50 in the solid state is unable
to give the formation of DMC at 330 K. Conversely, after dissolving it in CH3CN
and heating the solution at 330 K, a new IR signal centered at 1 755 cm1 appears
(C¼O asymmetrical stretching because of the DMC).
The GC-MS analysis of the solution conﬁrms the formation of DMC. The
reaction of isourea 3 with methanol and CO2 goes to completion with 100 %
conversion into DMC at 330 K. Above such temperature the reaction is more
complex as other products such as carbamates are formed (Fig. 6.9).

B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations reveal that 50 is 19.8 kcal mol1 more stable
than 5, which is attributed to the formation of the double H-bond and also to the
internal structural rearrangement of the protonated isourea moiety (Fig. 6.9). How-
ever, the data above clearly demonstrate that DCC is a promoter of the carboxyl-
ation of alcohols to dilakylcarbonates at room temperature, with a ΔG of
ca. 38 kcal mol1, because of the formation of DCU.
DCC may, thus, promote the reaction of alcohols with carbon dioxide to occur
under temperature and pressure conditions that are much milder than those encoun-
tered for metal-catalyzed reactions as reported above. In fact, the latter require 420–
470 K in CO2-pressurized alcohols (>5 MPa) or under supercritical conditions (sc-
conditions) for reaching a ca. 1–2 % concentration of carbonate at equilibrium at
best. However, it does not make sense to use DCC as a water trap in combination
with metal systems as DCC itself promotes the carboxylation reaction in milder
conditions than metal systems. Favorable thermodynamics is generated by coupling
of the carboxylation reaction with the formation of DCU from DCC, a thermody-
namically favored reaction, and brings about a quantitative conversion of the DCC–
alcohol–CO2 mixture when all reagents are in a stoichiometric ratio 1:2:1 as shown
in (6.12). An interesting additional piece of information is that the resulting DCU
can be easily recovered as it is insoluble in the reaction medium (different from
other organic water traps whose hydrated forms are soluble), and reconverted back
into DCC [75], a ﬁnding which may support the practical application of such
synthetic methodology for the synthesis of carbonates of alcohols bearing thermally
unstable moieties that require low reaction temperatures. Conversely, DCC is less

suited with alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, which would be used at a
>10 Mt year1 scale.
6.2.2.4
Urea as an Active Form of CO2
The unfavorable thermodynamics of the direct carboxylation of alcohols has
pushed efforts to ﬁnd alternative routes for the conversion of alcohols into the
relevant carbonates. An interesting possibility is represented by the use of urea
which is formed from CO2 and NH3. Urea can be considered an active form of CO2
(Fig. 6.12). Its formation ΔG is some 200 kJ mol1 less negative than that of CO2.
However, in principle, its reactions with alcohols would have less negative ther-
modynamics than the reaction of CO2 and, consequently, the equilibrium positions
should be shifted towards the right, reaching higher conversion at the equilibrium.
The synthesis of urea and its reaction with alcohols are reported in (6.13)–(6.15):

The alcoholysis of urea using alcohols and polyols has been known for a long time
[76] to proceed in two quite distinct steps. Reaction (6.14), bearing to the urethane,
at least with the lower homologues of the aliphatic alcohols, is a thermal reaction
and does not require any catalyst [76–78]. The second step is a transition metal-
catalyzed reaction. Ammonia formed in the two latter reactions can be recovered
and reacted again with CO2 to reform urea, thus resulting in a net consumption of

CO2 in the carboxylation, or used for other synthetic purposes, such as in amination
of organic substrates [79].
If reaction (6.15) is carried out at a temperature above 400 K, then the reactive
system becomes much more complex. In fact, at 408 K the decomposition of urea
(6.16) takes place, producing HNCO and NH3 able to react with the catalysts.

The decomposition has been clearly demonstrated by Sun for the reaction of urea
with methanol [78]. Moreover, as the linear carbonate formed is an excellent
alkylating agent, N-alkylation of urea and alkyl carbamate may occur. However,
reactor engineering and catalyst design are of primary importance to circumvent
secondary reactions. A catalyst quite active in alcoholysis of urea is ZnO. Under the
reaction conditions it converts into Zn(NCO)2(NH3)2, a soluble form [80]. There-
fore, ZnO is the precursor of the catalysts and not the catalyst itself: reaction (6.15)
proceeds under homogeneous catalysis. A point is that the solubilization of Zn does
not allow its easy recovery, with some practical problems. Research in this area is
still progressing to shed light on the real catalytic species and its implication in
catalysis. Sun et al., on the basis of DFT studies, have proposed that alcohol ROH
adds to Zn(NCO)2(NH3)2 forming Zn(NCO)(NH–COOR)(NH3)2 which then fur-
ther reacts with alcohol to afford the carbonate [81, 82]. A different mechanism has
been discovered by the Aresta group who found that the urethane (H2NC(O)OR)
coordinates to the metal center through the carbonyl moiety and undergoes further
reaction with alcohol to afford dialkylcarbonates and NH3 reforming the original
catalyst Zn(NCO)2(NH3)2 [83]. The latter mechanism is supported by the fact that
alkylcarbamate can be used as starting materials instead of urea. Therefore,
although it is clear that Zn(NCO)2(NH3)3 is the real catalyst, the mechanism it
works by is still under investigation: possibly, different mechanisms operate in
different experimental conditions. It is also well ascertained that in order to shift the
equilibrium to the right, continuous elimination of NH3 is benign. Catalytic distil-
lation has been applied to the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate by urea methanolysis
[84] with variable results: although the concept of catalytic distillation is simple, its
practical application is quite complex, implying process modeling, thermo-
dynamics of the ﬂuid phase equilibria, and optimization of the chemical kinetics.
It may work well if products have quite different boiling points and do not form
azeotropic mixtures.

Direct Carboxylation of Diols and Polyols
The direct carboxylation of diols and polyols has been attempted with variable
results. Diols have been investigated for a long time with some success. A variety of
synthetic techniques have been used. Among effective catalysts we recall: organic
bases (15.3 % yield, 100 % selectivity). Catalyst: TBD, 1,5,7-triazabiciclo
[4.4.0dec-5-ene] in the presence of ammonium carbonate and acetonitrile as a
water trap [97], and the use of electrogenerated heterocyclic carbenes [98]. The
above reaction suffers thermodynamic restrictions and water traps have been used
to shift the equilibrium. Recently, CeO2 has been used for the direct carboxylation
of propanediol to afford propenecarbonate with yields >60 % in the presence of
2-CN-pyridine as water scavenger [100].

carbonate. Reprinted with permission from [99]. Copyright (2006) Elsevier
Glycerol has been shown to react with CO2 under n-Bu2SnCl2 or n-Bu2SnO
catalysis to afford ca. 6 % glycerol carbonate, which is the equilibrium concen-
tration as shown by investigating the reaction at growing catalyst loadings [99]. The
proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Scheme 6.14. The tin glycerato complex
has been shown to oligomerize and separate. The oligomer does not react exten-
sively with CO2. Therefore the insertion of CO2 was proposed to take place on the
monomer before the oligomer was formed (or also concurrently with the ﬁrst
glycerol–O–Sn bond formation). The elimination brings about the formation of
an oligomeric Sn-oxo complex which must be reactivated by glycerol. Such
reaction has later been modeled using DFT and thermodynamic calculations
using the Peng–Robinson equation of state and Mathias–Klotz–Prausnitz mixing
rule [101]. It has been found that the reaction is only slightly exothermic

constants
(Keq298 ¼ 7.71  106 and Keq423 ¼ 3.26  106) which justify the conversion
yield of ca. 6 % reported above. The thermodynamic quantities above are of the
same order of magnitude as those reported above for linear carbonates.
Also in this case, the use of urea is of great help for increasing the conversion
[102]. Up to 90 % glycerol carbonate recovery has been reported using
γ-Zr-phosphate as catalyst [103, 104]. The reaction mechanism was elucidated
through kinetic and spectroscopic studies and proposed to be as reported in
Scheme 6.15 [105].
The reaction conditions play a key role for having a 100 % selectivity. The
temperature must be kept below 408 K: at higher temperatures the conversion rate
was increased but the selectivity was drastically decreased because of the occur-
rence of reaction (6.16) which drove other concurrent conversions of glycerol [105]
to afford oxazolidinones (Scheme 6.16).

Oxidative Carboxylation of Oleﬁns to Afford
Cyclic Carbonates
The oxidative carboxylation of oleﬁns appears to be an interesting approach to the
synthesis of cyclic carbonates from cheap and easily available reagents such as
oleﬁns, non-O2-free CO2, and air (6.17) mostly under heterogeneous catalysis.

The direct oxidative carboxylation of oleﬁns [108–110] couples two processes,
namely (1) the epoxidation of the oleﬁns and (2) the carbonation of the epoxide,
occurring in the same reactor. Interestingly, it has been shown that CO2 modulates
the oxidant properties of O2 [111].

Oxidative Carboxylation of Oleﬁns to Afford Cyclic Carbonates

The reaction can go via “one-oxygen transfer” or “two-oxygen transfer” to the
oleﬁn (Scheme 6.17). The former affords the epoxide (A), target product, or its isomers
aldehyde (B) and ketone (C). The epoxide is the precursor of the carbonate (E).
The latter route splits the oleﬁn into two aldehydes (RCHO and CH2O, D) which
in turn, depending on the reaction conditions, can be oxidized to the relevant acids.
The epoxide has been quantiﬁed in the reaction mixture [107] which leads one to
infer that the reaction is a two-step process in which the carboxylation of the
epoxide is the rate-determining step under the reaction conditions. Figure 6.13
shows the formation of the epoxide and carbonate in the one-pot oxidative
carboxylation.

Reaction Mechanisms in the Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols, Polyols. . .
The reaction is quite complex and the splitting of styrene to afford benzaldehyde
on the one hand is a negative fact as it subtracts the reagent, on the other hand it is
beneﬁcial as aldehydes (Scheme 6.18) are known to promote the epoxidation of
oleﬁns via formation of peroxo groups [107].
The reaction mechanism of the overall process can, thus, be distinguished in two
steps, the ﬁrst relating to the formation of the epoxide and the second to the
carboxylation of the epoxide (Scheme 6.19). Interestingly, it has been found that
the carboxylation step can be favored by the use of nucleophiles (halides are
common agents, or the solvent itself) which helps in stabilizing intermediate
cationic species, as shown in Scheme 6.19. The elimination of the epoxide from
the metal site competes with its carboxylation: therefore, such stabilizers may favor
the carboxylation over ring-closure to afford the epoxide and, thus, facilitate the
formation of the carbonate.

Only a few examples are reported in the literature of the direct carbonation of
oleﬁns, namely the direct functionalization of propene [112, 113] and styrene
[108]. Such an approach has a drawback represented by the addition of dioxygen
across the C¼C double bond with formation of aldehydes or of the relevant acids.
Using Rh-complexes the active species in the epoxidation of the oleﬁn has been
shown to be the peroxocarbonate moiety [114]. Using differently labeled O2
molecules such as 16(18)O–18(16)O it has been possible to build peroxo carbonates
bearing a well deﬁned O-isotope of the peroxo group linked to a metal atom,
namely M–16O–18O or M–18O–16O (see Sect. 4.4). However, it has been possible
to show that the metal-bound O-atom of the peroxo group is transferred to an
oxophile such as an oleﬁn [115].
Several other oxidants have been used for the oxidation of oleﬁns, such as
organic hydroperoxides or hydrogen peroxide [107], which have limitations in
their market volume not comparable with that of cyclic carbonates if the latter
have to be used as monomers for polymers or in other large scale uses. The goal
must be the direct use of dioxygen (or even better air) under controlled conditions
which may block the radical reactions involving O2 and oleﬁns.
It has been shown that the cleavage of the oleﬁn double bond can be avoided
using a two-reactor system ((6.18) and (6.19)) in which a metal oxide transfers one
lattice oxygen to an oleﬁn with formation of the oleﬁn oxide and is then re-oxidized
using dioxygen in a separate reactor [116]. A single reactor can be used which is
ﬂushed with the oleﬁn to get the epoxide and then with the correct amount of O2 to
regenerate the oxide.

In this way, the direct contact of O2 with the oleﬁn is prevented and the radical
process of addition across the double bond is avoided. Reactions (6.18) and (6.19)
are slow and the selectivity towards the epoxide in reaction (6.18) strongly depends
on the catalyst preparation, the nature of the metal, and the reaction temperature.
Using propene, the formation of the epoxide is in concurrence with the formation of
acetone and propionaldehyde. Moreover, depending on the preparation of the metal
oxide, the same catalyst can push the reaction to the formation of acroleine or even
to the total oxidation of propene to CO2 and water [117]. If, instead of the only
oleﬁn, a mixture of oleﬁn and CO2 is admitted on the catalyst in its oxidized form,
the carbonate is formed which can be recovered by condensation and the excess
oleﬁn recycled.
6.5
Carboxylation of Cyclic Ethers
Cyclic ethers are substrates of great interest as sources of cyclic monomeric
carbonates or even as co-monomers for the production of polymers through ring-
opening carboxylative polymerization. Their reactivity is driven by different
parameters, such as:
1. The ring size and the ring stress energy: three-, four-, ﬁve-, and six-membered
ethers have a quite different reactivity (see Table 6.2)
2. The substituents on the ring: groups which may produce a different charge
localization on O or ethereal Cs have an inﬂuence on the rate of opening of
the ring

3. The ring backbone: an ethereal ring on a linear alkyl chain (e.g., propeneoxide)

(e.g., cyclohexeneoxide)
These features inﬂuence the overall reaction rate and may also govern the
propagation of the insertion reaction and its regularity in the case of the copolymer-
ization reaction. Table 6.2 presents some properties of cyclic ethers. Such proper-
ties have long been known to inﬂuence the polymerization process [119]. The ring
strain energy has been calculated using ab initio methods [120] or by other methods
[121]. The basicity of cyclic ethers (Table 6.2) has been determined experimentally
[118] by using an adaptation of the method used for the determination of the
basicity of amines [122, 123].
The carboxylation of epoxides (6.20) has been known since 1943 but has been
exploited only much more recently. It may afford either cyclic carbonates or polymers,
depending on the catalyst used [124–126] and the reaction conditions [127–138].
A large variety of catalysts has been used, some of them in equimolar amounts or
suffering a very short life.
6.5.1
Synthesis of Monomeric Cyclic Carbonates
Organometallic species and metal complexes [139], classical Lewis acids [140],
metal phthalocyanines [141], metal halides [142], also coupled to β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD), a hydrogen bonding agent that accelerates the ring-opening in the absence
of organic solvents [143], polyoxometalates with ammonium salts [144], and
H-heterocyclic carbenes [145] all catalyze the ring opening of epoxides. The
salen or analogous ligands based on an “N2 + O2” set of donor atoms have been
largely used with metals such as: aluminum [146, 147], nickel [146], copper [146,
148, 149], zinc [146, 148, 149], magnesium [149], cobalt [146–148], chromium
[146, 147, 150], tin [146, 147, 151], manganese [146, 147] or ruthenium
[147]. Recently, bromine (or N-bromosuccinimide, NBS) has been reported as an
effective catalyst for the carboxylation of epoxides [152] in the presence of bases.
Heterogeneous catalysts [153, 154], including metal oxides [155–157], are inter-
esting catalysts characterized by a longer life with respect to homogeneous systems.
Amides, such as dimethylformamides (DMF) or dialkylacetamides (DAA), often
used as solvents, promote by themselves the carboxylation of epoxides [108],
perhaps to a limited extent. The synthesis of optically active carbonates has been
carried out and, interestingly, metal oxides can catalyze the carboxylation of
optically active epoxides with total retention of conﬁguration [110, 147], most
probably through a double inversion mechanism. The resolution of a racemic
mixture of the epoxides was not very successful, with an ee of the order of 22 %,

using Nb(IV) complexes with optically active (N, O, P as donor atoms) ligands,
because of the de-anchoring of the ligand from the metal center at the reaction
temperature, as shown by an NMR study [110]. Microwaves have been shown to
promote the formation of carbonate in IL [159, 160]. Exhaustive reviews on the
carboxylation of epoxides have recently been published [146, 158, 161–168].
Scheme 6.20 Ring opening of epoxides and coupling to CO2 promoted by nucleophiles or
electrophiles. Adapted with permission from [158]. Copyright (2010) Elsevier Ltd
The mechanism of the carboxylation passes through several steps, such as: ring
opening, CO2 coupling to the opened ether structure, back-biting to form the cyclic
carbonate, and elimination with regeneration of the catalyst. The ring opening is
driven in different directions according to the catalyst employed, as shown in
Scheme 6.20. An electrophile (or Lewis acid) attacks the O-atom and the
carbocation formed is stabilized by interaction with the nucleophilic species X
(often a halide anion). An insertion into the E–O bond (usually fast if the nucleo-
phile is a metal cation; see Sect. 4.4) generates the open form of the carbonate.
Back-biting and cyclization produce the carbonate. Conversely, a nucleophile
(halide ion, quite often) attacks the C of the epoxide and makes the open
carbanionic form of the epoxide (stabilized by interaction with an electrophile)
ready for an attack at the C of CO2. Ring closure by back-biting and elimination of
the catalyst produces the carbonate. As a matter of fact, although the ring opening
can be started by a nucleophile or an electrophile, catalysis requires a Lewis acid–
base pair. Ammonium salts of various structural complexities play such a role. A
metal most likely produces an attack at oxygen with formation of a “MOR+” moiety
stabilized by a nucleophile (halide ion) [109]. An alternative to monometallic
systems are bimetallic catalysts [169, 170] which have also been shown to be
quite active in the presence of tetrabutylammonium salts (bromide) (Scheme 6.21).
Of interest is the kinetic law discovered by the authors (6.21).

On the basis of such a kinetic law, the authors have proposed the reaction mech-
anism depicted in Scheme 6.22. The presence in the kinetic equation of both the
ammonium ion and the free amine is quite singular. The role of the latter is to
interact with Lewis acids, such as coordinatively unsaturated metals or other
species.

In the case of Br2 promoted carboxylation [171], Br+ is supposed to attack the
oxygen of the epoxide whereas Br stabilizes the carbocation. This is a particular
case, as it is known that bromine in the presence of bases affords Br and BrO3
 or
BrO, according to the conditions.
That solvents may play a key role in the carboxylation of epoxides was proposed
by Dibenedetto et al. [109] who showed that both dimethylformamide and
diacetamide may also catalyze the carboxylation of epoxides if at a low extent
(Scheme 6.23). The active role of DMF has been conﬁrmed in the case of the
bromine catalyzed carboxylation of epoxides [171]. DMF has been proposed to
attack CO2 (Scheme 6.23) and prompt it to a reaction with epoxides.
Sc-CO2 is often used as solvent and reagent and is considered to be an economi-
cally viable and ecologically benign reaction medium. It has several advantages
such as no ﬂammability, lack of toxicity, absence of a gas-liquid phase boundary,
and possible simpliﬁcations in workup. The advantages of using Sc-CO2 alone
[172] or in combination with IL [173, 174] have been described. Amides play a
220

positive role because of participation either in the ring opening of the epoxide or in
a preliminary coordination of CO2 [109].
6.5.2
Synthesis of Polycarbonates
Polycarbonates have long been produced by using phosgene. This ﬁeld is now
moving to new synthetic strategies based on: (1) the direct copolymerization of
oleﬁn-oxides and CO2 (propene carbonate, Novomer), (2) the use of CO2 sub-
stitutes (organic carbonates formed from CO2) if the epoxide is not easily produced
(this is the case of BP-A), or (3) the polymerization of preformed monomeric
carbonates, as represented in Scheme 6.24. The latter would produce a very regular
polymer characterized by 50 % CO2 and co-monomer.
The carboxylation of epoxides may afford either monomers, as discussed above,
or
polycarbonates:
for
example,
Al-porphyrin
complexes
[175,
176]
or
Zn-compounds [177] promote the formation of polycarbonates. The pioneering
studies of Inoue [178] and Kuran [179] have opened the route to the investigation
of the copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides. The key issue here is to master the
alternate insertion epoxide-CO2.

polymerization of dialkylcarbonates and diols (bottom), polymerization of pure cyclic monomers
(top right)
6.5
Carboxylation of Cyclic Ethers
221
The properties of the polymer depend on the regularity of the incorporation of
CO2 and the epoxide [125, 180, 181]. Bifunctional Co-salen complexes have been
used as promoters of the alternating copolymerization of epoxides and CO2
[182]. Co(III) complexes with tetraamidomacrocyclic [183] and salen-type ligands
have been demonstrated to be very efﬁcient in the copolymerization of epoxides
and CO2 with a TOF of 15 000 h1 [184], working with a substrate/catalyst ratio of
50 000. Double metal cyanide systems also show an interesting activity [185]
(TOF ¼ 3 856 h1). It must be recalled that the polymer molecular mass is impor-
tant but the regularity of the alternate insertion is also very important. Therefore, a
high rate of insertion must be coupled to a perfect alternate insertion for producing
polymers that have good properties. Often, polymers with average properties are
obtained because of a poor alternate insertion.
The use of epoxides characterized by a different molecular structure may be of
interest as polymers with different structural properties may be obtained. Therefore,
an issue of great interest is the discovery of new routes to the production of
epoxides using dioxygen instead of hydrogen peroxide in the epoxidation of oleﬁns.
From the short discussion above, it comes out that a number of parameters
inﬂuence the “perfect” polymerization. They can be identiﬁed as metal center,
ligands, cyclic ether, co-catalyst, temperature, solvent. Table 6.3 summarizes the
role of each parameter and presents the inﬂuence on the polymerization.
Table 6.3 Parameters that inﬂuence the rate of the polymerization and the regularity of the
alternate insertion
Parameter
Role
Metal center
Metals such as Al, Co, Cr, Mn, Zn, and Sn are active in the form of soluble
complexes. A single site is necessary for catalysis to occur. In general such
complexes have an octahedral structure with the active site at one of the axial
positions. The trans ligand has an inﬂuence in labilizing the M–O or M–C bond
and favoring the insertion
Ligands
A tetradentate ligand is usually required, of the type of salen or salan, with a
N2 + O2 set of binding atoms. Also N4 sets have been used. The rigidity of the
N2 + O2 set of atoms may play a role. Ornamental groups of various bulkiness and
electron donor properties also play a key role. Dicarboxylato ligands have shown
some usability as Zn complexes. Ligands must force a planar geometry around
the metal center and control the insertion at the apical position. Chiral ligands
may regulate the insertion of asymmetric oleﬁns
Cyclic ether
The facility of opening of the ring may speed the reaction. The structure of the
ether is also important. An ethereal link in a linear structure behaves differently
from alicyclic ethers
Temperature
Low temperatures in the range 298–330 K produce polymers, higher tempera-
tures tend to form molecular cyclic carbonates
Solvent
The micropolarity of the solvent may help to stabilize polar or ionic forms and be
beneﬁcial to the reaction. For example, solvents with donor atoms (halides,
nitrogen, oxygen) may be useful in the stabilization of the open form of the ether
Co-catalyst
A co-catalyst is used to start the reaction or stabilize intermediates. Halides are
usually good starters and large ammonium cations play a role in the stabilization
of intermediate forms

Reaction Mechanisms in the Direct Carboxylation of Alcohols, Polyols. . .
The reaction mechanism for the copolymerization is initiated as shown in
Scheme 6.24, left and once the ﬁrst coupling epoxide-CO2 is performed, the growth
of the chain should proceed with a perfect alternate insertion of epoxide and CO2.
During the chain growth, a back-biting elimination mechanism may occur in
several ways [186] which brings about the formation of cyclic carbonate, as
proposed by Darensbourg (Scheme 6.25).

Polycarbonates are used in several different applications, from buildings to car
manufacture, CDs and specialty optical. The market has seen a steady growth in the
last years: the 2013 demand was over 4.5 Mt. PC demand is foreseen to grow by
roughly 5 % per year on average by 2016 [187]. Other sources foresee a growth of
the market by 6 % annually, although the PC demand by China is estimated to be
higher than 8 % on a yearly basis. Such a forecast is based on the expansion of the
use of PCs in the building sector and in the mobility sector with major growth in
China [188, 189].

Formation of Polyurethanes: Carboxylation
of Cyclic Amines
The formation of carbamates RR0N–COOR00 has been discussed in Chap. 4. There
are several applications in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, materials, and poly-
mer industries. Dicarbamates are of particular interest as they are used as monomers
for polymers. Among dicarbamates, those derived from primary amines are of great
industrial interest as they can easily lose alcohol and produce isocyanates (6.22).
6.6
Formation of Polyurethanes: Carboxylation of Cyclic Amines
223
Diisocyanates are monomers for the production of polyurethanes (6.23) which ﬁnd
extensive industrial application as foams, insulating materials, packaging, etc.
Polyurethanes can also be obtained via copolymerization of cyclic amines such as
aziridines (analogous to epoxides) and azetidines (analogous to oxetanes) with
CO2, according to Scheme 6.26 [190, 191].
The interaction of such cyclic amines with metal centers and CO2 to afford
oxazolidinones (cyclic carbamates) has already been discussed in Sect. 4.9. Here we
discuss the production of polymers, an application that has not received further
development for more than 30 years, most likely because of the cost of the cyclic
amines. Only recently a revamping in this area has brought us to reconsider the
reaction with the aim of improving the quality of the polymer [192] and bringing
close to one the ratio amine/CO2 which is usually much higher than one because of
the easier insertion of the aziridine with respect to CO2. Polyurethanes are long-
lasting materials and their synthesis from CO2 would represent a way of storing
CO2 for a long time.
Very recently the cyclic carbamate structure has been generated by a route based
on the reaction of glycerol carbonate (made from glycerol and CO2 or urea; see
below) and urea as a source of N-atoms for the substitution of a ring-oxygen with a
ring-NH group. So, such a reaction uses a bio-derived C-skeleton and cheap
co-reagents (CO2 and urea) for the production of added value molecules such as
the oxazolidinones. The direct reaction of glycerol with urea can produce both
glycerol carbonate and oxazolidinones, according to the temperature (Scheme 6.27)
[105]. The reaction mechanism of such a reaction that produces useful monomers
has been fully elucidated as shown in Scheme 6.27. Noticeably, the oxazolidinones
are interesting monomers for polymers.

Conclusions
The reaction mechanism for formation of dialkyl carbonates from alcohols and CO2
has been investigated with different catalysts and shown to be a two-step process.
The ﬁrst step is always an alcohol base-activation that affords the alkoxo moiety
RO. This species is promoted by a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst and
affords a cat-OR species which undergoes CO2 insertion to give the emicarbonate
cat-OC(O)OR.
The latter undergoes alkylation with formation of the dialkylcarbonate,
(RO)2CO. The alkylation step has been demonstrated to occur in different ways
depending on the catalyst used. In the DCC- and n-Bu2Sn(OCH3)2-catalyzed
processes for synthesis of dimethylcarbonate it has been shown that the methyl
cation CH3
+ is provided by a cat-OCH3 species which is converted into either a
C¼O or an O–Sn–O moiety, respectively. None of the end compounds, DCU or Sn–
O–Sn oligomers, are per se active in catalysis. In the homogeneous Nb-penta-
alkoxo-catalyzed synthesis
of
dialkylcarbonates
(RO)2CO
(R¼CH3,
C2H5,
CH2¼CH–CH2) the critical step is represented by a simultaneous acid- and base-
activation of the alcohol molecule which concurrently affords the carbonate and
regenerates the catalyst which can be isolated and reused. The same is true for
heterogenized Nb-catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts have been shown to be char-
acterized by a mechanism that follows the scheme previously discussed up to the
formation of the S-OC(O)OR moiety (S is the surface). The latter is converted into
the organic carbonate by interaction with gas phase alcohols. At least in one case,
namely the synthesis of diethlylcarbonate from ethanol and CO2 using Nb-Ceria
mixed oxides, the involvement of two molecules of ethanol in the latter step has
been demonstrated. The data available so far seem to support the view that the acid-
activation of methanol is the key step, and the involvement of Brønsted acids seems
to boost the process more than Lewis acids. The use of hyperactive heterogeneous

temperature (310 instead of 450 K) does not represent a real beneﬁt, as the
selectivity towards the carbonates is lowered from 100 to <20 %, with a negative
impact on the overall process. The use of urea is an interesting approach which may
increase the conversion yield. Two different reaction mechanisms have been
proposed. Cyclic carbonates are produced either by reaction of epoxides with
CO2 or by direct oxidative carboxylation of oleﬁns, a reaction that needs control
for avoiding oleﬁn splitting under radical conditions caused by oxygen. The actual
selectivity of 55–60 % is a starting point. The reaction of diols or polyols with urea
also gives cyclic carbonates with good yields and selectivities. Cyclic amines react
with CO2 to afford oxazolidinones, also synthesized by reacting polyols with urea.
Polycarbonates can be formed by three routes, namely the copolymerization of
epoxides and CO2 (a process that requires catalyst control for a regular 1:1
copolymerization), the reaction of diols with linear carbonates, and the polymer-
ization of monomeric cyclic carbonates. The reaction mechanism has been investi-
gated and critical parameters identiﬁed. The search for new catalysts and monomers
for new polymers with new properties is a current hot topic. Cyclic amines can
co-polymerize with CO2 or oxazolidinones can be polymerized in a more regular
way. This ﬁeld is fast moving, considering the industrial interest existing in new
materials with new properties which, eventually, can be used for chemical storage
of CO2.

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High
Temperature Reactions
Abstract This chapter deals with high temperature reactions in which carbon
dioxide (CO2) is used either as dehydrogenation agent (“soft oxidant”) or hydrogen
user (“reduction to other C1 molecules”). The ﬁrst part of the chapter covers
reactions such as the oxidative coupling of methane, the dehydrogenation of
alkanes to oleﬁns, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, and, ﬁnally,
CO2 reforming of methane.
The second part covers the reaction of CO2 with hydrogen in processes such as
the reverse water gas shift reaction and the synthesis of both methanol and dimethyl
ether.
All processes discussed here already have an industrial exploitation or are
related to processes on stream, so that a large set of data is available in the literature.
This chapter illustrates the building-up of knowledge for demonstrating the reaction
mechanism in processes in which very often several conversion routes of CO2
coexist and the role of support and catalysts is essential for addressing the reaction
in one or another direction.
7.1
Introduction
In recent years, signiﬁcant efforts have been made towards the utilization of CO2 in
high temperature catalyzed reactions, such as dry reforming of methane (DRM),
oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
(DH), in addition to the conversion of CO2 into oxygen containing fuels such as
methanol and CH3OCH3 (DME, dimethyl ether) [1]. Transformation of CO2 into
hydrogen-containing chemicals typically requires hydrogen or electroreductive
processes implying e and H+ transfer [2–5] (see Chap. 8). The use of CO2 as
oxidant in selective processes and C-source in the synthesis of methanol or other
energy rich species such as DME are key reactions [6] that may substantially
contribute to the conversions of large volumes of CO2 contributing to greenhouse
gases (GHG) mitigation, besides having an economic value.

7.2
CO2 as Oxidant
CO2 activated by a catalyst is able to play a role as an oxidant or dehydrogenating
agent and to replace steam and oxygen. Examples are the oxidative coupling
reactions, the oxidative dehydrogenation, and reforming reactions. CO2 has an
important role in gasiﬁcation of carbon deposits on a catalyst (thus avoiding catalyst
deactivation), especially in reactions such as CO2 (dry) reforming of methane
(DRM) (see Sect. 7.1.4) whereby coke formation is a prevalent issue, especially
with the widely used Ni-based catalysts.
7.2.1
OCM Promoted by CO2
Natural gas with methane as the principal component is mainly utilized for heating,
methanol and ammonia synthesis, or generation of electric power [7]. With the
recent discovery of large reservoirs of shale gas, methane could soon increase its
role as fuel and feedstock for the synthesis of chemicals [8], replacing oil. The
conversion of methane via OCM into C2 hydrocarbons such as ethane (7.1) and
ethene (7.2) [8] is an interesting technology for the direct conversion of natural gas
into molecules which can ﬁnd applications in the energy sector (ethane) or in the
chemical and polymer industry (ethene) [9].

ΔH298K ¼ 67:4 kJmol1
ð7:2Þ
C–C coupling is at the core of organic synthesis and serves as the foundation for
generating more complex organic compounds from simpler ones [10]. Light oleﬁns
such as ethene and propene, are often used as building blocks in the production of
chemicals.
OCM to C2 species proceeds via a two-step process, namely: (1) C–H bond
cleavage over the oxidized catalyst sites producing CH3• or CH2• radicals; and
(2) coupling of the above radicals to produce ethane and ethene, respectively
[11]. In the presence of O2, some unselective gas-phase radical reactions which
cause deep oxidation have a profoundly unfavorable impact on the OCM reaction,
resulting in formation of COx [12].
However, despite its prospective cost-effectiveness, commercialization attempts
at such high temperature reactions (T ¼ 873–1 173 K) have not been successful so
far because of the low C2 yields. As a matter of fact, the current commercialized
process for ethene production is based on the pyrolysis of naphtha or the steam-
based dehydrogenation of ethane [8]. Returning to oxidative coupling reactions, to
prevent loss of C2, the utilization of an oxidant softer than O2 is desirable [7, 8],
which does not promote the formation of radicals. CO2 can play such a role and
offers interesting advantages over O2 because utilization of CO2 prevents deep
238

combustion prevalent in O2-mediated reactions, which lead to undesirable forma-
tion of various COx by-products. Second, the reaction between methane and CO2 is
more chemoselective and is mainly controlled by catalysis, because CO2 would not
induce gas-phase radical reactions [7]. In addition, the utilization of CO2 with
methane offers tremendous potential in terms of reducing the climate impact,
because both CO2 and methane are potent GHGs.
The main pathways for OCM with CO2 as a “soft” oxidant are shown in (7.3) and
(7.4) [13]:

ΔH298K ¼ þ196:2 kJmol1
ð7:4Þ
The CO2-OCM reaction is a complex heterogeneous process involving [7]:
1. Cleavage of C–H bond of the methane molecule on the solid surface
2. Dissociation of CO2 to CO and oxygen atoms
3. Recombination of CH3• or CH2• radicals released from the surface
4. Oxidative or radical dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene
7.2.1.1
Catalytic Systems for CO2-OCM
The principal requisite to target in designing the catalytic system for CO2-mediated
OCM reactions is the ability of the catalyst in activating both highly stable CO2 and
methane molecules, ensuring high product selectivity. The two C–O bonds in CO2
require a high amount of energy for their dissociation (>200 kcal/mol) [14]. In
general, the effective catalysts for conventional OCM reaction are strong basic
oxides, which behave as p-type semiconductors at higher temperatures and possess
oxygen anion mobility [15, 16]. They can be divided into four groups [15], namely:
(1) highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the lanthanide oxide
series (excluding CeO2) are most promising; (2) basic oxides loaded with Group 1
or 2 cations (e.g., Li/MgO, Ba/MgO, and Sr/La2O3, as monophasic oxides); (3) a
few transition metal oxides that contain Group 1 cations; and (4) any of the above-
mentioned materials promoted with chloride ions. Previous works on OCM with O2
as oxidant highlighted the importance of catalyst basicity [17, 18]. The Na2WO4/
Mn/SiO2-based catalyst has been widely studied for OCM [18, 19]. Using such a
catalyst, Palermo et al. [18] obtained 33 % methane conversion with a C2 selectivity
of 80 %. They have attributed such interesting result to the presence of Na+ which
plays a dual role as both structural and chemical promoters and can convert the
active and unselective amorphous silica carrier into a catalytically inert crystalline
phase. The surface-bound WO4 tetrahedron was found to be the catalytically active
site (based on Raman data by Wang et al. [20]) in the Na2WO4-based catalyst.
Research on this catalyst for the CO2-OCM reaction has shown an interesting C2

selectivity of 94 % at the reaction temperature of 1 093 K. Even though reactions at
higher temperatures are more favourable for methane conversion, on increasing the
temperature the bulk lattice oxygen of the catalyst becomes more activated, thus
promoting deep oxidation of methane, which is detrimental to the selectivity
towards the desired C2 products. In fact, the selective oxidation of methane to C2
species is facilitated by the surface lattice oxygen [21].
Some early studies on basic oxides such as MgO, Sm2O under co-CO2-fed OCM
reactions were found to improve C2 yield and selectivity, whereby the presence of
CO2 suppressed catalyst deactivation and decreased the amount of coke produced in
the long run [22]. According to Lunsford et al. [23, 24], the enhanced selectivity in
C2 over Li/MgO could be attributed to the poisoning effect of CO2 resulting in
surface modiﬁcation (i.e., carbonate formation), which promoted secondary reac-
tions with the alkyl radicals. These ﬁndings were concurred by Wang and Ohtsuka
[25] who studied the activity of Group 2 metals such as Ca, Sr, and Ba on Mn-based
ternary mixed oxide. The improvement in selectivity for the Sr- and Ba-based
ternary mixed oxides was attributed to the formation of SrCO3 and BaCO3 carbon-
ates. These carbonates were postulated to react further with MnO2 located on the
boundaries forming SrMnO2.5 and BaMnO2.5, which can improve the methane
conversion and selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons. Even though carbonates have
high decomposition temperatures (mostly above 1 100 K), the carbonates formed
from strontium and barium in this catalyst system are most likely to possess
greater reactivity in the presence of Mn, which resulted in improved catalytic
performance.
Rare earth elements such as lanthanum oxide have also been tested for the CO2-
OCM reaction. Results from Chen et al. [26] demonstrate that the ternary oxide of
La2O3–ZnO could give a C2 yield of 2.8 % with high stability at 1 123 K. However,
Xu et al. [27] found that by doping the appropriate composition of La2O3–ZnO
mixed oxide with suitable amounts of K2O, a signiﬁcant improvement was found,
with a C2 yield more than six times higher (18.1 %). Recently, Oshima et al. [28]
investigated the performance of La2O3–ZnO mixed oxide as catalyst for the CO2-
OCM reaction using electric ﬁeld non-thermal plasma and they obtained a C2 yield
at 4.5 %, even at the low temperature of 423 K. In a plasma process, the high energy
electron-impact dissociation of the C–H bond to radicals CHx is the main process
involved [29]. Compared to conventional ﬁxed-bed reactors with high operating
temperatures, Oshima et al. [28] obtained good performance, which was attributed
to the synergetic effect between La cation, tetragonal ZrO2, and the electric ﬁeld.
The utilization of electric ﬁeld non-plasma techniques appears to be interesting and
with much potential because the operation temperature can be drastically lowered.
Besides, the utilization of an electric ﬁeld facilitates a quick start-up, which is
especially suited for smaller scale processes [28].
Redox catalysts such as ceria modiﬁed with Group 1 or 2 metal oxides are
also effective for the CO2-OCM reaction [30, 31]. The redox interchange
between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states is crucial for CO2 dissociation to CO
and lattice oxygen species. The modiﬁcation of ceria with metal oxides such as
240

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
CaO [31, 32] improves C2 selectivity and, because of the basic nature of CaO,
produces a large chemisorption of CO2. In addition, the incorporation of bivalent
Ca2+ (0.99 Å) cations into the CeO2 lattice generates defect sites, which promote
redox reactions between Ce4+ (0.97 Å) and Ce3+ (1.14 Å) [33] with improved
methane conversion. He et al. [34] have prepared CeO2/ZnO catalysts and
observed that higher catalytic conversions were obtained using nanostructured
catalysts, compared to the bulk counterparts prepared using conventional
impregnation techniques. This is further support to the importance of nanostruc-
tured catalysts, which, because of their large surface areas, allow greater expo-
sure of catalytic sites to the reactants. Previous investigations have also
emphasized the importance of the redox properties of the catalysts, using PbO–
MgO, whereby PbO supplies oxygen for the coupling reaction. It should be noted
that PbO does not form stable carbonates under the operating conditions
[35]. The redox properties and the participation of lattice oxygens from rare
earth elements such as praseodymium (Pr) and terbium oxides were also found to
produce a high conversion yield and C2 selectivity up to 50 % for a stable CO2-
OCM catalytic performance (20 h test run) [36].
7.2.1.2
Reaction Mechanism for CO2-OCM
Depending on the type of metal oxide used as catalyst, two reaction mechanisms
are suggested for the CO2-OCM process. One pathway is the adsorption of CO2
over a defective metal oxide, followed by O-transfer from CO2 to the oxide
lattice with CO release. The active oxygen species selectively converts methane
into the methyl radical which, upon recombination, gives ethane. Ethene would
be formed through oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [7]. The second possible
mechanism involves the reaction of methane with lattice oxygen of the metal
oxides, forming methyl radicals, which are responsible for the formation of C2
hydrocarbons. In this process, the metal is partially reduced and the oxygen
vacancies are replenished by CO2 [36], which is converted into CO. This mech-
anism mainly applies to catalysts with redox centers such as Ce(IV), or even to
those which possess an abundance of lattice oxygen vacancies, especially in a
defective oxide structure. However, there is the possibility of combination of both
pathways in this process.
Wang et al. [31] investigated the possible mechanism involved in the CO2-OCM
reaction using CaO–CeO2 catalysts. Because ceria is a redox catalyst, they exam-
ined the possibility of its lattice oxygen species participating in the reaction of
abstracting H from the methane molecule by carrying out the reaction in the
presence and absence of CO2. A lower selectivity in the absence of CO2 proved
that the heterocumulene plays an important role in the reaction. By coupling kinetic
studies and CO2 chemisorption data, they proposed the mechanism shown in
Scheme 7.1.
7.2
CO2 as Oxidant
241
Scheme 7.1 Proposed mechanism for CO2-OCM reaction over CaO–CeO2 catalyst [31]
The authors proposed that CO2 adsorbs on the catalyst by interacting with the
acid Ca2+ sites at the outermost layer via the O-atom (B). The Ce3+ sites present in
ceria activate CO2 forming CO and “active oxygen” species present most likely as
subsurface oxygen (C), responsible for the conversion of methane to methyl radical
(D). Hence, the cooperation of Ca2+ and Ce3+ sites in solid solution of the catalyst
leads to a greater chemisorption and activation of CO2, which produces more active
oxygen species for selective C2 formation. As discussed above, the incorporation of
Ca2+ into CeO2 lattice (proven by XPS analysis) generates defect sites, which can
also promote redox interchange between Ce4+ and Ce3+ [31].
Wang and Ohtsuka [25] have studied Sr(Ba)O–MnO2 oxide ternary catalysts for
the CO2-OCM reaction. Sr(Ba)CO3 and MnO were the main species at steady state
of the reaction and were converted into SrMnO2.5 after helium treatment. By
correlating the reaction data, which show the presence of CO2 and CO, with XPS
data (Fig. 7.1), demonstrating the reduction of the oxidation state of Mn from
mainly 4+ to 2+ after reaction (increased to 3+ after helium treatment), they
proposed that the reaction had to take place according to (7.5). The locations at
the boundaries between Sr carbonate and MnO2 is most likely the focal reaction
point.

7.2.2
Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes
The utilization of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has
received considerable attention in recent years. CO2 has the potential to act as both
a hydrogen acceptor and a “soft” oxidant. As co-fed gas in the oxidative dehydro-
genation of light alkanes, it shifts the reaction equilibrium towards more oleﬁn
production [37, 38]. The ODH reaction is of great interest as it represents a
straightforward reaction for the production of oleﬁns such as ethene, propene, and
butene from their respective saturated hydrocarbons. Such oleﬁns are classiﬁed as
building blocks in the petrochemical industry. Ethene, in particular, has a diversi-
ﬁed derivatives portfolio and can be used for the production of plastics, polymers,
ﬁbers, and packaging materials [39, 40]. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is
reversible and, because of limitation by thermodynamics, the reaction is often
carried out at high temperatures (>800 K). Industrially, steam cracking of hydro-
carbons or naphtha is used for the synthesis of ethene, a very energy-consuming

[39]. Hence, it is desirable to utilize an oxidant capable of oxidizing, in the
presence of a suitable catalyst, the hydrogen produced so as to shift the equilib-
rium. The use of molecular oxygen as oxidant can effectively reduce the reaction
temperature. Nevertheless, undesirable factors affect this reaction such as the low
selectivity because of the production of COx species from HCs, the need to
remove excess heat of reaction, and the undesired reaction mixture ﬂammability
[41]. On the other hand, CO2 has been found to serve as a medium for heat supply
for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, as a diluent to enhance equilibrium
conversion of alkanes and as a coke removal agent from the catalyst [38]. In
addition, CO2 inhibits deep oxidation of the reaction products, thus improving
the oleﬁn selectivity [42]. The generic reaction pathway for the CO2-ODH is
shown in (7.7):
CnHnþ2 þ CO2 ! CnHn þ CO þ H2O
ð7:7Þ
It should be noted that, in the dehydrogenation of higher alkanes, the oleﬁns
produced generally contain allylic hydrogens. The H-abstraction from the
allylic position has a greater afﬁnity towards production of coke precursors
because of lower bond dissociation energy compared to the saturated substrate
[43, 44]. This results in catalyst deactivation, which in turn leads to low oleﬁn
yields.
7.2.2.1
Catalytic Systems for CO2-ODH of Alkanes
Notably, catalysts with redox properties, such as molybdenum-, chromium-,
and vanadia-based catalysts, show high activity in various oxidative dehydro-
genation reactions of hydrocarbons [45–48]. Factors inﬂuencing the reaction
also include acid–base bifunctionality, which plays an important role in CO2-
mediated dehydrogenation reactions [49]. Both basic sites and Lewis-acid
vacant sites are important for hydrocarbons activation [50]. In fact, an
enhanced basicity results in an improved performance because of the rapid
desorption of the electron-rich alkenes, whereas Lewis acid sites enhance the
dehydrogenation process [51]. In addition, in the presence of CO2 as feed,
surface basicity favors the adsorption and reactivity of the acid CO2 molecules
[52] (see also previous chapters).
The best performing chromium-based catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes
are those supported on mixed oxides, mesoporous silica, and zeolites [53–55] as
well as diamond [43]. Such high surface area supports facilitate good catalyst
dispersion, which is essential for high catalytic activity and stability. Cr-based
catalysts supported on mesoporous supports such as zeolitic TS-1 [55], high silica
H-ZSM-5 [56], and siliceous MCM-41 [53] were found to be highly active and
selective for the CO2-ODH reaction of ethane and propane. Despite their high
244
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
catalytic activity, however, deactivation was observed caused by the reduction of
the active chromium species on the support. In fact, as suggested by Takehira
et al. [53], based on EXAFS data, tetrahedral Cr(VI) is coordinatively unsaturated
and represents the active site for alkane dehydrogenation; bulk Cr(III) ions, with a
coordinatively saturated and stable octahedral geometry, are much less active, if not
inactive for alkane dehydrogenation [57–59]. The regeneration of the deactivated
catalyst, i.e., reoxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) species, can be performed with CO2.
However, the reduction–oxidation cycle involving Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordina-
tion and Cr(III) in octahedral coordination and CO2 has an important role in alkane
dehydrogenation. Similar to its mesoporous counterpart, the catalytic activity of
chromium supported on silica was found to correlate with the chromium dispersion,
which is affected by the grafting of chromate species with various nuclearities on
the silica surface [60]. Based on the investigation by Botavina et al. [60], DR-UV–
vis studies indicate that Cr(VI) in the form of extended polychromates (less
dispersed) results in a lower activity compared to the surface chromates with
lower nuclearity. It is now clear that the nature of the support affects the distribution
of the surface chromium species, ultimately playing a decisive role in catalytic
activity [61].
Besides supporting the catalysts on mesoporous supports, it is also possible to
incorporate the catalyst within mesoporous structures, up to a certain loading
percentage. For example, Liu et al. [62] have investigated the performance in
ethane dehydrogenation of Cr incorporated into MSU-1 (a type of mesoporous
molecular sieve) and Cr supported on MSU-1, the former labeled as Cr-MSU-1
and the latter as Cr/MSU-1. The family of MSU-1-type mesoporous silica is less
acidic than the SBA-15 or MCM-41 types and possesses uniform, three-
dimensional, worm-like channels, favorable for the diffusion of molecules, in
addition to its properties of high surface area [63]. The higher activity of the
Cr-supported catalysts, especially at Cr loading >1 wt%, however, is coupled to a
lower selectivity because of cracking reactions. This is attributed to a higher ratio
of inactive polychromate species compared to the more selective monochromate
species. In addition, with higher Cr loading (>8 wt%), the catalyst dispersion is
severely affected, resulting in the decrease of Cr(VI) species and an increase in
crystallite Cr2O3 species [57, 62]. More recently, Baek et al. [63] prepared highly
dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica using an
electrostatically controlled assembly process via the (N0Mn+)I0 pathway devel-
oped by Pinnavaia et al. [64]. This catalyst was found to exhibit 90 % selectivity
towards propene formation with a yield of 30 % in the CO2-ODH of propane. A
steady state in terms of propane conversion was achieved within 25 h, and the
deactivation observed was attributed to coke formation and reduction of active
chromium sites.
CO2 as oxidant (Scheme 7.2) is found to boost the regeneration of the reduced
chromium sites formed during the dehydrogenation of propane (7.8) and the
consecutive reduction with H2 (7.9) [47], where CrOx represents the oxidized
form and CrOx1 represents the reduced form of the catalyst).

Scheme 7.2 CO2-ODH of propane over chromium oxide catalytic sites
The effect of promoters such as Fe, Co, and Mn oxides on Cr-based Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts for CO2-ODH of ethane was found to increase markedly
the ethene selectivity [50]. In this study, the acid–base properties of the catalysts
were found to have the most signiﬁcant inﬂuence. Weak acid sites promote ethene
formation through better ethane activation, whereas strong acid–base sites favor the
side reactions of reforming and cracking of ethane [50]. Another important phe-
nomenon discussed in this study is that the amount of various types of oxygen
species, i.e., the lattice oxygen (OI), oxygen in adsorbed CO2 or carbonates (OII),
and adsorbed oxygen species (OIII), can inﬂuence the reaction rate and the selec-
tivity towards ethene production. In fact, lattice oxygen species are mostly respon-
sible for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas the adsorbed oxygen species
contribute towards deep oxidation, leading towards more COx formation [50,
65]. Anyway, the amount of adsorbed CO2 is quite important as it can promote
the dry reforming of ethane, a concurrent reaction to ODH. It should be noted that
catalysts such as Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 suitable for OCM reaction for ethene produc-
tion are also active in the ODH of ethane [66]. Zhu et al. [67] have investigated the
effect of Co addition to Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 for CO2-ODH of ethane. However,
likewise Ni, the presence of Co favors the reforming of ethane with CO production.
The catalytic properties of vanadium oxide depend on the acid–base nature of
the supporting materials [68] and on the dispersion of the vanadium species on the
support [69]. Park et al. [44] have successfully synthesized V2O5 supported on
various mixed oxides such as SnO2–ZrO2 [44], CeO2–ZrO2, and TiO2–ZrO2
[37]. The SnO2–ZrO2-supported V-catalyst was found to have a good catalytic
activity attributed to the high surface area and superior acid–base bifunctionality,
with generation of more medium strength acid–base sites compared to vanadia
supported on single oxides. Such optimal basicity was found to inhibit dehydroge-
nation of n-butenes to butadienes, besides precluding side reactions to occur
because of the easy desorption of alkenes [70]. The reducibility of V2O5 is strongly
affected by the nature of the support. In the case of CeO2–ZrO2-supported V2O5,
despite the slightly lower conversion with respect to TiO2–ZrO2 and SnO2–ZrO2-
supported catalysts, the total selectivity towards C4 oleﬁns is much higher and this
is attributed to the participation of larger amounts of lattice oxygen species and
oxygen vacancies (which are replenished by CO2) because of the formation of
CeVO4 species [37]. This is not surprising, because CeO2–ZrO2 supports are known
for their redox nature because of the increased oxygen mobility, good thermal
resistance, high oxygen-storage capacity, and facile oxidation/reduction of the Ce4+/
Ce3+ couple [71, 72]. However, when V2O5 is incorporated in chromium oxide
246
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
catalysts, an enhanced redox activity is observed, because of the reduction of Cr6+ to
Cr3+ and V5+ to V4+, resulting in a higher ethene selectivity [73]. Nevertheless,
comparing Cr and V–Cr catalysts, one can ﬁnd that the latter produce a lower yield
because they require a higher reaction temperature.
A well-dispersed catalyst results in a better stability for the ODH reaction and,
therefore, mesoporous structured supports such as MCM-41 or SBA-15 are highly
indicated. It has been found that impregnation of vanadium on mesoporous sili-
ceous MCM-41 results in greater density of surface-active sites compared to
amorphous silica because of the large pore diameters and the stronger interaction
which exists between the active species and its support [74], hence the increasing
interest in this type of support. In addition, SBA-15 types of mesoporous silica
possess thicker walls (31–64 Å) compared to their MCM-41 counterparts, thus
providing greater thermal and hydrothermal stability [69]. At predominantly low
vanadia content (1–5 wt%), isolated tetrahedral vanadium oxide species containing
terminal V¼O groups well dispersed on the mesoporous silica have been identiﬁed
to be the active sites. Excess vanadia loading leads to a larger presence of poly-
merized vanadium species on the silica surface, which may result in a negative
effect on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation process [69]. Recently,
mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3–Al2O3 prepared via nanocasting were identiﬁed as
effective catalysts for the CO2-ODH of propane [75]. At 832 K, propene was
produced with a yield of 10–18 % and a high selectivity of 91–95 %. The higher
stability of the mesoporous gallium oxide catalysts is an important fact, because the
conventional gallium oxide-based catalyst investigated by the same research group
had shown deactivation within 1 h of reaction time [76]. The new preparation
method for Ga2O3-based catalysts can effectively provide a hard template, which
suppresses the collapse of mesoporous structure typically occurring during gallium
oxide recrystallization [75].
Several studies have investigated the CO2-ODH of light alkanes, not only with
CO2 as the sole oxidant but also co-fed with oxygen [38]. Early work concentrated
on the co-feed of CO2 (considered as promoter) together with oxygen as a means to
improve the dynamic phenomena at the surface of oxides in order to improve the
yield of oleﬁns via ODH reactions. This approach was believed to improve the
efﬁciency of the catalyst because CO2 acted as a modulator of the oxidative
properties of oxygen [14, 77]. Among the beneﬁcial effects arising from the
introduction of CO2 in the system are: (1) faster, more extended formation of
oxycarbonate phase and its regeneration; (2) formation of a peroxocarbonate
[77, 78] intermediate, which serves as a promoter for gas phase oxygen oxidation;
(3) lower tendency for deep oxidation of hydrocarbons (whilst minimizing hot spot
formation); and (4) decrease in coking effect [14].
Urlan et al. [38] showed that the ODH of n-butane over titanium pyrophosphate
(TiP2O7) can be successfully improved by co-feeding CO2 in the system. However,
when CO2 was used as the sole oxidant, the n-butane conversion was lower.
Similarly, when CO2 partial pressures were increased over V–Mg–O catalysts,
the yield and selectivity of C4 dehydrogenation products were found to show
7.2
CO2 as Oxidant
247
some improvement [79]. It was surmised that, when CO2 was used as the sole
oxidant, the competition with alkanes, signiﬁcantly affected the adsorption of CO2
on the catalyst surface and, thus, the reoxidation of the catalyst, leading to a drop in
conversion [44].
Another group of catalysts, i.e., the molybdenum oxide-based, possess a chem-
istry comparable to that of vanadium oxide, because Mo can be present as MoOx
monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the Mo loading, type of
support, and catalyst preparation techniques and conditions [80]. For instance, a
study on the effect of CO2 for ODH over Mo2C/SiO2 has demonstrated that CO2 is
beneﬁcial in oxidizing the Mo2C forming Mo-oxycarbide at higher temperatures,
with the Mo-oxycarbide species playing an important role in the activation of the
alkane [46, 81]. Similar behavior can be found for other supports such as Al2O3 and
TiO2. In fact, Dury et al. [14] found that the introduction of just 3 % CO2 for the
ODH reaction of propane over NiMoO4 leads to dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst
surface, inducing the oxidation of molybdenum suboxide at temperatures around
673–723 K. Experiments using NiMoO4 in alkane oxidation have shown that the
presence of molybdenum oxides as well as molybdates can enhance the catalytic
properties [82, 83]. The oxygen species derived from the dissociation of CO2 were
found to play a more positive role in oxidation compared to molecular oxygen by
cleaning and protecting the sites during the reaction [14, 83] and avoiding radical
formation.
7.2.2.2
Reaction Mechanism for CO2-ODH of Alkanes
Two major roles are proposed for CO2 in the CO2-ODH reaction, i.e., (1) CO2
oxidizes the reduced catalytic sites during the dehydrogenation process, hence
participating in a redox process and (2) CO2 removes hydrogen formed in the
dehydrogenation process via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, thus
shifting the reaction equilibrium towards product formation.
7.2.2.2.1
Redox Mechanism
The redox nature of the catalysts used for the ODH reactions beneﬁt from CO2
dissociation on catalyst sites producing surface oxygen species is parallel to the
alkane dehydrogenation by CO2. For example, based on the investigation
conducted by Mimura et al. [56] for the CO2-ODH of ethane over the reducible
Cr supported on zeolite (Cr/ZSM-5), an important role of CO2 in the Cr redox
process in the catalytic cycle was highlighted. A comparison of the FTIR spectra of
the fresh (A) catalyst and treated (B) catalyst (Fig. 7.2a) indicates that the reduction
of the peak intensity at 925 cm1 attributed to the Cr¼O double bond can be related
to the reaction with ethane. Such reduction is indicative of a reduced average
oxidation state of the Cr species under the reaction condition and this can be related
to a higher dehydrogenation rate by Cr¼O species compared to the reoxidation rate
248
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
of the reduced Cr species by CO2. The EXAFS data (Fig. 7.2b) show that the bond
length for the fresh sample (A) is similar to CrO3 (i.e., Cr¼O double bond species),
whereas after ethane treatment (B), a longer bond length, similar to the Cr–O single
bond in Cr2O3 is observed. On the other hand, the latter sample after CO2 treatment
(C) exhibits similar bond length with the fresh sample. Hence, the authors have
correlated such changes to the regeneration of the Cr6+¼O species to the initial state,
which are consistent with FTIR results [56]. However, the activation of alkanes on
Cr¼O is quite similar to that on vanadia catalysts, whereby isolated tetrahedral
vanadium oxide species containing terminal V¼O double bond species have been
suggested to be the active centers for the selective formation of alkenes [84].
Hence, based on such ﬁndings, a reaction scheme (Scheme 7.3) was suggested
by Mimura et al. [56] for the CO2-ODH of ethane over the active Cr/HZSM-5
catalysts.
Scheme 7.3 Redox cycle of active Cr species on zeolite surface [56]
The oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ during the catalyst regeneration with CO2 can lead
to redispersion of chromia crystallites, which is a particularly important step,
because without the presence of a mild oxidant such as CO2, the sintering of

chromia under dehydrogenation conditions has been reported to be a contributing
factor to the reversible deactivation-activation of chromium-based catalysts
[80]. The important role of the Cr redox cycle has also been highlighted for similar
reactions over monolithic Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts [61]. The difference
in conﬁguration of monolithic catalysts (known for their high heat and mass transfer
rates) compared to conventional ﬁxed-bed reactor setups is that the Cr-based
monolithic metal catalysts are prepared with FeCrAl foil with honeycomb structure
which acts as the support and SBA-15/Al2O3 as washcoat [61]. Similarly, for Cr
supported on mesoporous silica such as MCM-41 [53], CO2 was observed to
participate as the oxidizing agent whereby the redox process via the consumption
and re-ﬁlling of the defect sites formed from lattice oxygen uptake from gas phase
CO2 was deemed to be the key factor in the reaction process.
A ﬁne example demonstrating the role of CO2 in the redox mechanism is given
by the classical redox type of catalysts such as vanadia and ceria. As such, an
interesting example for this is represented by the investigation by Park et al. [37]
who studied the CO2-ODH of butane on V2O5/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst, of which both
the vanadia and the ceria support are known for their redox nature. The abundance
of lattice oxygen in the catalyst/support results in participation of the lattice oxygen
in the dehydrogenation process, although the oxidation state of the metal is reduced
to a lower state (7.12).

In this process, which proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen (redox) type mechanism
[85], the role of CO2 as an oxidant is critical in re-oxidizing the lower oxidation

7.2.2.2.2
Surface Reactions for Removal of Hydrogen via RWGS
The presence of CO2 in the ODH reaction has been found to promote desorption of
oleﬁn from the catalyst surface and aid removal of hydrogen produced by alkane
250

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
dehydrogenation via the RWGS reaction. For example, Xu et al. [86] studied the
CO2-ODH of propane over gallium-based catalysts with various supports such as
alumina, zirconia, titania, and silica. Ga2O3/Al2O3 exhibited the best performance
in promoting the dehydrogenation of propane because of the surface acidity. Their
results match the ﬁndings of Chen et al. [87] who attributed the good catalytic
performance of analogous catalysts to the formation of gallia-alumina solid solu-
tions, which allow the favourable generation of numerous coordinatively unsatu-
rated surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity [88]. Unlike conventional vanadia
or chromium redox-based catalysts, gallium is known to be quite stable as Ga3+
[89]. Therefore, instead of a redox mechanism, the authors have proposed that
propane is adsorbed on gallium oxide where it is heterolytically dissociated,
forming gallium hydrido-alkoxo species as shown in (7.14).
ð7:14Þ
The alkoxo species further decompose to form oleﬁn (7.15) via β-H shift. Hydrogen
can be formed from the coupling of the hydride and proton (7.16) or removed by
CO2 (via the RWGS reaction route) (7.17).
ð7:15Þ
ð7:16Þ
ð7:17Þ
The rate-limiting step in this process is the propene formation via β-H shift (7.15).
Moreover, as Ga2O3 and H+ are on the catalyst surface, the propyl carbenium ion on
Ga2O3 might readily exchange with a proton via surface migration reaction (7.18) [90]:
ð7:18Þ
where S is the catalyst surface site. The formation of propene is again the result of a
β-H shift with desorption from the active site (7.19):

oxide and proton migration, which increases the dehydrogenation of propane
[86]. Hence, the reduction of the hydrogen partial pressure shifts the dehydrogena-
tion equilibrium towards production of oleﬁn. In addition to removing hydrogen
(7.17), the role of CO2 is also that of removing any carbon formed on the surface in
this process via the reverse Boudouard reaction [86, 91].
So far in the literature, the kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation has mostly been
studied on direct dehydrogenation reactions or by using oxygen as the oxidant.
Recently, Liu et al. [42] have studied the kinetics of ODH of propane in the
presence of CO2 over Cr/MSU-1 catalyst. The sequence of mechanistic steps
shown in Scheme 7.5 was modeled based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mecha-
nism and the surface reaction between adsorbed propane and adsorbed CO2 (7.22)
was found to be the rate-determining step. Such data correlate well with other
studies on ODH of propane with O2 as oxidant, afﬁrming that the H-abstraction
from the secondary carbon atom in adsorbed propane is the irreversible rate-
determining step [85].

Scheme 7.5 Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanistic steps for the CO2-ODH of propane [42]
For the CO2-ODH of alkanes, the proposed pathway advocated by several
groups [92–94] was found to be in agreement with the experimental results of
some studies in which the formation of notable amounts of CO and H2O during the
reaction was observed [43, 44]. According to the proposed general pathways
(Scheme 7.6), hydrogen from the alkane dehydrogenation is oxidized by CO2 via
RWGS reaction (7.26), producing CO and H2O. In addition, the CO2 reforming of
ethane (more favorable at higher temperatures) was proposed to be one of the side
reactions (7.28) [50]. As mentioned earlier, CO2 also aids in oxidizing the deposited
carbon, forming more CO via the reverse Boudouard reaction (7.29) [44].

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
In recent investigations, Peng et al. [95] have studied the effect of co-feeding
methane in the CO2-ODH of ethane at high reaction temperatures (1,073 K) using a
Ni–La/SiO2 catalyst. They noted that methane affected the equilibrium of CO2
reforming of ethane (7.30) and the CO2-ODH of ethane.
C2H6 þ 2CO2 ! 4CO þ 3H2
ð7:30Þ
In fact, the presence of methane induced the CO2 (dry) reforming of methane to
take place, hence retarding the CO2 reforming of ethane. More ethane can, thus, be
selectively converted into ethene through the CO2-ODHE process (7.30) instead of
undergoing dry reforming. It was also found that the type of carbon deposited on the
catalyst bed was more reactive (i.e., ﬁlamentous type) compared to the case in
which no methane was co-fed. Hence, Peng et al. correlated the improvement in the
ethene selectivity to the easier removal of ﬁlamentous carbon with CO2 [95].
Solymosi et al. [46] found that, despite the slow reaction of CO2 with Mo2C at
873 K, the appearance of new peaks at 233.3 and 236.2 eV in the XPS spectra
indicates the occurrence of a fast reaction between Mo-O species and propane. In
fact, based on the catalytic activity data and XPS measurements, they found that
propane and ethane were effective carburizing compounds. Hence, they proposed
that CO2 oxidizes Mo2C forming Mo oxycarbide, whereby propane has the possi-
bility of forming a surface complex with the active oxygen of the carbide as shown
in (7.31) [46].

Michorczyk et al. [47, 96, 97] studied the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane on
chromium oxide supported on various types of mesoporous siliceous supports such
as SBA-1 [47], MCM-41 [96], and SBA-15 [97]. In general, they found that the
RWGS reaction can proceed over redox and non-redox Cr sites [47, 96]. This
inadvertently enhances the alkane conversion as hydrogen is eliminated from the
dehydrogenation process. Based on their experimental evidence, it was found that
in the RWGS reaction the CO formation rate grows together with the concentration
of Cr redox species in CrOx/SBA-1 catalysts, a scenario similar to the dehydroge-
nation of propane in the presence of CO2. Their conclusion tallies with previous
reported results [98, 99], whereby the RWGS reaction is postulated to occur via the
redox mechanism in which Cr3+ species are successively reduced to Cr2+ by H2 and
then reoxidized by CO2 (Scheme 7.7). The reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ is promoted
over a silica support which facilitates the electron ﬂuctuations necessary for the
7.2

253
reduction process [96, 100], prior to reoxidation with CO2. In Scheme 7.7, the CrOx
and CrOx1 represent the oxidized and reduced redox Cr sites, respectively,
whereas the CrOy represent non-redox Cr sites [47].
Scheme 7.7 Postulated reaction pathways for propene formation via CO2-ODH reaction
Based on Scheme 7.7, the oxidative pathway relates to the presence of reducible
Cr sites forming a redox cycle CrOx (oxidized sites) and CrOx1 (reduced sites).
The reduced forms identiﬁed as Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites are active in the non-oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane. It was also presumed that the non-redox Cr3+ species
(CrOy) forming chromium(III) oxide agglomerates may participate in the
non-oxidative pathway to a lesser extent because of the lower number of active
sites [47].
Similarly, using an iron promoted Fe–Cr/ZrO2 catalyst for the CO2-ODH of
ethane, Deng et al. [99] observed that the dehydrogenation of ethane is activated by
the Cr3+ species whereas Fe3O4 formed during the reaction can promote the RWGS
reaction. The formation of Fe3O4 was detected on the basis of XPS spectra: it is an
important ﬁnding because the inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4 can produce a rapid
electron exchange between Fe3+ and Fe2+ which can facilitate the progress of the
reaction [99, 101].
7.2.3
Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Styrene
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODE) to styrene is a promising
alternative or complement to the current industrial technology based on steam,
which may contribute to meeting the growing demand for styrene and the strong
market incentive [93, 102]. Styrene is one of the most widely used feedstocks in the
production of high-value commercial products such as synthetic rubbers, polysty-
rene, and styrene–acrylonitrile copolymers [93, 103, 297]. The global styrene
annual production is 14.6 Mt, with the US producing 4 Mt and Europe 3.4 Mt,
respectively [104]. Figure 7.3 shows the global styrene consumption growth over
2008–2015 [105], following the very similar trend observed in the previous decade.
The growing rate is higher for developing regions than for mature markets in
America and Europe. Signiﬁcant downstream expansion and emerging plants in

the Middle East mean that the Middle East is the dominant world exporter of
styrene [105].
The well-established industrial dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene is
carried out with a large excess of steam to overcome carbon deposition and the
thermodynamic
barriers
of
the
reaction
[49,
106].
However,
the
high
endothermicity of the process causes a low conversion rarely exceeding 50 %.
The occurrence of some side reactions such as production of toluene, benzene, and
coke also affects the process yield and selectivity, and leads to catalyst deactivation
[41]. A large excess of steam, a growing energetic and environmental issue, is often
required to improve the catalytic selectivity to above 90 % and overcome the loss in
selectivity and yield caused by irreversible coke formation [49, 107].
Oxygen can be used as dehydrogenating agent, but this raises problems of
radical formation. A promising alternative is to use CO2 as dehydrogenating
agent, which presents several advantages such as enhanced styrene selectivity
(97 %), inhibition of the total oxidation, and prevention of hot spots [41, 106,
108, 109]. In fact, compared to other types of oxidants such as N2O and SO2, there
is no loss of latent heat for CO2 [110]. In addition, compared to steam, the energy
consumption is about 1.5–1.9  105 instead of 1.5  106 kcal/mol of styrene pro-
duced [41]. The overall process, based on a single step pathway is shown in (7.33),
whereas the two-step pathway is deﬁned by (7.34) and (7.35) as shown in
Scheme 7.8 [111].

As shown in (7.35), the hydrogen produced is removed as steam by the RWGS
reaction, thus shifting the equilibrium towards the formation of dehydrogenation
products. Furthermore, carbon deposition can be minimized by simultaneous
removal via CO2 gasiﬁcation. This process also minimizes the generation of
undesired COx species. Interestingly, as (7.35) can be reversed, H2 and CO2 can
be regenerated in a separate reactor, making CO2 a net promoter of reaction (7.34).
7.2.3.1
Catalytic Systems for CO2-ODE to Styrene
Several factors contribute to good selectivity towards styrene production from CO2-
ODE, such as the redox and acid–base properties of the catalyst. Iron oxide-based
catalysts have been shown to possess high activity and selectivity towards styrene
production via CO2-ODE [112]. The research focus has been on improving the
viability of Fe-based catalysts for this process. Some early work has shown that iron
oxide in the presence of CO2 induces an increased selectivity towards styrene.
Different supports such as alumina and activated carbon have been used [111, 113,
114]. Nevertheless, the iron-based catalysts show several drawbacks and efforts
have been made for identifying promoters or alternative catalysts. Some of the
drawbacks include low surface area, lack of stability, and vulnerability towards
deactivation of the catalytically active Fe3+ sites compared to metal oxides such as
titania [102, 108]. Castro et al. [102] synthesized porous iron-based catalysts by
adding Ti, Al, or Zr, and found a higher catalytic performance in the case of Ti
modiﬁcation. The in situ formed stable mixed phases such as FeTiO3, Fe2TiO5, and
FeTi2O5 resulted in highly active species resistant to phase transformation and
sintering, thus, assuring high catalytic performance, although coke formation
increased because of ethylbenzene cracking. In addition, styrene oligomerization
took place [102].
Mg-Fe/Al-based catalysts were developed via impregnation and sol gel methods.
Spinel MgFe0.1Al0.9O4 showed high catalytic activity and stability. The good
performance was attributed to the weak acid sites, as shown by NH3-temperature
programmed desorption studies [115]. In addition, the Fe3+ active site species are
well distributed in the spinel lattice, hence demonstrating properties such as resis-
tance to reduction and avoidance of sintering. Fe3+ being the active sites was
suggested by Zhu et al. [116] from results from transient kinetic experiments.
Ceria-based iron oxide catalysts can form solid solutions (Ce1xFexO2) and were
found to perform better than ceria-based Zr, Ti, Pr, and Y mixed oxides [117]. In
order to stabilize the lattice structure of CeO2 and the oxygen diffusion capacity, the
Ce1xFexO2 catalyst was prepared via the hydrothermal method and a highly
dispersed Fe2O3 on the surface of the Ce1xFexO2 solid solution was obtained
[117]. The formation of solid solution with Fe3+ in the CeO2 lattice is conﬁrmed
via Raman analysis (Fig. 7.4) as demonstrated by the shift and decrease of the
intensity of the diffraction peak at 462 cm1, corresponding to CeO2. The Fe3+
doping has the potential to improve the reaction kinetics [118], but can lead to
strong structural distortions, with a lower energy for the formation of oxygen
256
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
vacancies, compared to the undoped system. As a result, the authors found that this
structure distortion results in the creation of more oxygen vacancies promoting the
adsorption and activation of CO2, leading to a higher conversion by 13 %. They
attributed the higher catalytic performance to the rapid oxygen exchange between
Ce4+ and Ce3+ redox sites promoted by Fe3+ and improvement in oxygen storage
capacity of ceria, which enabled iron to maintain its high shift activity [119].
Vanadium-based catalysts have been widely explored. For example, Sakurai
et al. [120] observed high EB conversion (67.1 %) and selectivity to styrene (80 %)
for vanadium supported on activated carbon in the presence of CO2 at 823 K
(EB conversion was 14 % higher than in the presence of argon). Vanadium-
substitution in Mg–Al hydrotalcite-like catalysts resulted in Mg–V–Al mixed
oxides with high surface area and mesoporous characteristics, which are favourable
for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene under CO2 ﬂow [121]. In addition, V5+
was identiﬁed as the active site for the dehydrogenation process [121]. The key
properties of this catalyst, besides its mesoporous characteristics, are the weak
Lewis acid sites contributed by aluminum, which reduce the catalyst deactivation.
Titanium oxides doped with vanadium were prepared using the acid-catalyzed
sol gel technique, shown to be an effective method for preparing a catalyst with a
well determined ratio of V to Ti [122]. Based on TEM images, Fig. 7.5, the authors
showed that loading V5+ up to 6 mol% (the optimal amount for best catalytic
activity) caused the diminution of the particle size because of incorporation of
vanadia into TiO2. Such a preparation method is capable of producing a good
dispersion of vanadia, hence favoring the formation of small crystallites.
Likewise, Park et al. [123, 124] have studied the effect of ceria on the structure
and catalytic activity of V2O5/TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst for the CO2-ODE reaction. In
their previous research, the authors had found that titania–zirconia mixed oxides
exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the CO2-ODE to styrene
because of the high speciﬁc surface area, good acid–base and redox properties,

allied with the high thermal stability and strong mechanical strength of TiO2–ZrO2
mixed oxides [125, 126]. Because of the preparation method, the formation of
crystalline ZrTiO4 spinel phase was observed. ZrV2O7 and CeVO4 phases were also
produced. A high EB conversion of 56 % and product selectivity of 98 % was
obtained over the ceria doped catalyst. In addition, Raman analysis revealed that the
catalyst particles were nanosized (<7 nm) with a narrow particle size distribution.
Furthermore, without ceria, the catalyst suffered a faster rate of deactivation.
Adding ceria produces a catalyst, the redox properties of which suppress carbon
deposition. Park et al. [127] have explored the use of redox-based CeO2–ZrO2
mixed oxide supported on a high surface area mesoporous silica such as SBA-15.
Positive results were obtained thereby, with an increase of the reaction temperature
from 723 to 923 K, and a remarkable increase in EB conversion from 21 to 65 %
was observed. In fact, the redox nature of the catalyst enables its oxidation-
reduction activity to be more pronounced at the higher temperatures because of
the surface and sub-surface rearrangements involved during the reaction, which
enables the increase in availability of surface oxygen [127].
Another type of mesoporous silica, i.e., MCM-41, has also been employed as a
high surface area support for vanadia catalysts [128]. Upon comparison with the
conventional silica support, it was evident that better dispersion could be obtained
on the mesoporous material, as demonstrated by Raman spectra showing the
presence of strong bands of isolated tetrahedral VO4 [128].
7.2.3.2
Reaction Mechanism for CO2-ODE to Styrene
Several possible mechanisms have been identiﬁed by Sun et al. [129] taking into
consideration that EB is activated by acid–base catalysts or lattice oxygen (via
redox mechanism) in the presence of CO2. Based on the CO2-ODE reaction over V-
and Fe-supported catalysts, Sun et al. [130] found that a synergistic effect exists
between EB dehydrogenation and the RWGS reaction. In fact, CO2 can be either

reduced to CO via interaction with redox sites (one-step mechanism) or by reaction
with hydrogen formed in EB dehydrogenation (two-step pathway) as shown in
Scheme 7.9 [130].
Scheme 7.9 Role of CO2 in the CO2-ODE process
Based on these two pathways, three vital mechanistic steps are proposed and are
discussed with the relevant examples. Mechanism 1 (one-step pathway) is redox-
based: vanadia or ceria type catalysts play an important role in the activation of both
CO2 and EB. The C–H bond breaking proceeds via a Mars-van-Krevelen (redox)
type mechanism and lattice oxygen of the catalyst is consumed during the dehy-
drogenation process, producing styrene and water (7.36)–(7.40) in Scheme 7.10
[131]. The lattice oxygen, however, is replenished by CO2 dissociation to CO and
surface oxygen species. Different types of V and Ce species act as oxygen carrier
through their oxidized-reduced pairs [132].

Scheme 7.10 Mechanism 1 via one-step pathway for CO2-ODE process (open circles – oxidative
site; closed circles – reductive site)
Sakurai et al. [133] have investigated the possible reaction mechanism of the
ODE to styrene over conventional ODH catalysts such as VOx supported on MgO.
In the presence of CO2, a high styrene yield of 73.8 % was obtained with a
selectivity of 90.1 % at a temperature of 873 K. Based on the data collected by
using several characterization techniques such as UV-vis, FTIR, and XRD, it was
ascertained that the active phase of vanadium was the V5+ species in vanadia or
Mg3V2O8 on highly dispersed MgO. The lower reduction states of vanadia were
deemed to be less reactive sites for the dehydrogenation. As shown in Scheme 7.11,
the lattice oxygen from the magnesium vanadate structure abstracts hydrogen from
EB, producing water and styrene and, as a result, the vanadium species is
simultaneously reduced. Another recent study by Chen et al. [134] on CO2-
ODE over silica-supported vanadium (VOx/SiO2) also suggests the redox
7.2
CO2 as Oxidant
259
mechanism and highlights the active site as the V5+ species. The role of CO2 is
found to be effective to maintain or regain the high oxidation state of vanadium,
enhancing its activity for EB dehydrogenation. They also found that both the
coke deposition and deep reduction of active vanadium species contribute to the
catalyst deactivation. However, because of the chemically inert nature of the
silica support, CO2 in this example was only effective in protecting the oxidized
vanadium species from deep reduction, but was not so effective in inhibiting
coke formation.
Scheme 7.11 Proposed redox mechanism over Mg loaded vanadia catalyst [133]
Similar to CO2-ODH, Liu et al. [135] have proposed a redox mechanism
(as shown in Scheme 7.12) for highly dispersed vanadium oxide supported on
Ce0.6Zr0.4O2–Al2O3. Zirconia stabilized with ceria is well known to be an excellent
redox material, especially when ceria is enriched in defect sites. At the optimal
vanadium oxide loading in Ce-Zr oxides, high styrene selectivity of up to 95 % can
be obtained.
Scheme 7.12 Proposed redox mechanism for CO2-ODE over V2O5/Ce0.6Zr0.4O2–Al2O3 [135]
As explained by Liu et al. [135], the simultaneous oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ by
CO2 and the reduction of V5+ to lower oxidation states (very likely V4+) by
ethylbenzene are the main pathways involved in the CO2-ODE. Subsequently,
with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, V4+ is oxidized to V5+ to complete the full
cycle. Figure 7.6 shows the Raman spectra of the support (1) and at various V2O5
260

loadings (6 wt% vanadium oxide is the optimal loading) on CZS. The broad Raman
shift centered at about 940 cm1 can be assigned to the interface mode of bridging
V–O–S (where S refers to metal cations from the support, i.e., Al, Ce, and Zr) which
is found to be the main catalytic active site for the CO2-ODE. The other two peaks
relate to V–O–V and V¼O bonds, which increase when the vanadium oxide loading
is increased, leading to poorer dispersion and lower catalytic activity. A high
dispersion of vanadium oxide on the support is critical for the high catalyst stability.
The stabilization of V5+ with the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ has been discovered by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations [136] which support the proposed
Scheme 7.12 [135].
The presence of ceria is inﬂuential in promoting the redox pathway, even in the
presence of iron oxide. Studies by Wang et al. [117] have shown that the
incorporation of iron oxide in the ceria lattice results in the formation of a solid
solution. Hence, during the reaction, the surface Fe3+/Ce4+ absorbs the EB mole-
cule, and the surface oxygen of the catalyst abstracts H from the ethyl moiety,
generating H2O and forming styrene, whilst the reduction of the surface active
centers to Fe2+/Ce3+ takes place, generating oxygen vacancies on the surface
(7.41). CO2 is adsorbed on the oxygen vacancy (7.42), and dissociates to CO
and surface oxygen by accepting electrons from the transformation of Ce3+$Ce4+
(Fe3+$Fe2+) (7.43) [298]. In this mechanism, the defective structure containing
oxygen vacancies is important to accelerate the adsorption of CO2 as well as the
diffusion rate of oxygen. A similar mechanism is prevalent on perovskite-type
oxides such as Cr0.75Fe1.25O3. It should be noted that the low surface area of the
perovskite structures results in lower EB conversion, despite having good selec-
tivity to styrene [108] (Scheme 7.13).

Scheme 7.13 Inﬂuence of redox sites of Fe3þ=Ce3þ on the CO2-ODE reaction
Systems such as iron on an acid–base-type support follow Mechanism 2 or
3 (both are two-step pathways). Mechanism 2 proposes the occurrence of RWGS
reaction coupled with dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2. In this
mechanistic pathway, the acid–base bifunctionality of the catalyst plays an impor-
tant role in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions [49]. The acid
properties of the catalyst are important in the activation of EB, whereas the basic
sites are for CO2 adsorption to form carbonates for hydrogen blockage. The
cooperative action of acid sites and basic sites is fundamental [49].

Scheme 7.14 Two-step pathway for the CO2-ODE to styrene via RWGS reaction (crossed circle/

Acccording to Nederlof et al. [137], the reaction of CO2 with hydrogen produced
in EB dehydrogenation (RWGS) can shift the equilibrium towards higher conver-
sions. The difference between the two-step Mechanisms 2 and 3 are represented in
Schemes 7.14 and 7.15, respectively. In Mechanism 2, the H atoms formed upon
EB dehydrogenation attack one of the oxygen atoms of CO2 with the formation of
CO and OH moieties (step of RWGS). The latter species generates H2O. In
Mechanism 3, the direct dehydrogenation of EB takes place on a vacant oxygen
site producing hydrogen atoms [111]. The latter associate to form molecular
hydrogen, which reacts with the O atoms generated on the catalyst by CO2
conversion to CO [137].

Scheme 7.15 Two-step pathway for the CO2-ODE to styrene (open circles – oxidative site;

Mechanism 3 (Scheme 7.15) is accepted to be more thermodynamically favor-
able [135]. Nederlof [137] and Badstube [299] have investigated the CO2-ODE
reaction over iron oxide catalyst supported on activated carbon. Their experimental
data correlate with this postulated two-step mechanism, whereby EB dehydroge-
nation is followed by redox-type RWGS reactions (Fig. 7.7).
He et al. [138] have carried out studies on the role of CO2 in EB dehydrogenation
over Fe2O3 using DFT calculations. They have combined the two general mecha-
nisms (one-step, two-step) on iron catalysts, i.e., the redox cycle and the dehydro-
genation (Scheme 7.16). The two Mechanisms related to the RWGS reaction are
combined together and labeled as the “coupling mechanism,” as shown in
Scheme 7.16.

Scheme 7.16 General mechanism pathway over Fe-based catalysts [138]
Three model surfaces were considered in calculations, namely the Fe-, ferryl-,
and O- terminated surfaces as shown in Fig. 7.8. The authors found that the lowest
energy barriers were on O-terminated surfaces. They therefore suggested that this
was the active site for the reaction. With styrene production taking place on the
O-terminated surface, some lattice O-atoms are removed through H2O formation,
resulting in the generation of Fe-terminated surface. Because of the high TS energy,
CO2 dissociation and formate production are hindered. Hence, the authors con-
cluded that a synergistic effect between EB dehydrogenation and RWGS reaction
takes place, producing H2O and/or H2 via carboxyl species (CO2H) or formate
(HCO2) intermediates (see Scheme 7.16) following the “coupling mechanism.”
Such theoretical results correlate with Mechanisms 2 and 3 proposed by Sun
et al. [129] centered on the RWGS reaction, which may take place on the iron-
based catalysts.
Badstube et al. [114] have investigated the CO2-ODE over iron oxide catalyst
supported on activated carbon in the presence of CO2. In addition to styrene,
benzene, and toluene, they detected CO and H2O. Comparing the experimental
data with the postulated mechanisms, they concluded that both the RWGS reaction
and the redox cycle mechanism contribute to ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the
264

presence of CO2. Likewise, Chang et al. [139] scrutinized the role of CO2 on the
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene over zeolite-supported iron oxide
catalyst. Production of styrene, H2O, CO, and a small amount of H2 were observed.
This makes evident that CO and H2O are obtained from CO2 reduction coupled to H
abstraction from EB by surface oxygen or via the involvement of RWGS reaction.
Therefore, the authors proposed that both the coupling and redox cycle mechanisms
are possible for CO2-ODE over their catalytic system. However, CO2 plays a dual
role in the mechanisms discovered with experiments and calculations: either forms
an active site on the catalyst by transferring O atoms to a reduced site, or acts as
scavenger of H2 formed upon EB dehydrogenation shifting the equilibrium to the
right.

CO2 (Dry) Reforming of Methane
In industrial practice, steam reforming of methane (SMR) is widely used for
hydrogen/Syngas production. Steam reforming of methane is known to release a
large amount of CO2 which is eventually vented to the atmosphere [140]. However,
in view of global climate change concerns, which have been increasingly attributed
to GHG emissions, CO2 (dry) reforming of methane (DRM) is becoming an
attractive alternative. DRM reaction produces Syngas (1:1 mixture of CO and H2
in the speciﬁc case (7.57)), which can be used as feedstock for industrial processes
such as Fischer–Tropsch, methanol synthesis, or hydrocarbonylations [141]. DRM
is a highly endothermic reaction (7.56), which has similar thermodynamics and
equilibrium characteristics with steam reforming of methane (7.57) except that the
former reaction produces synthesis gas with a lower H2/CO ratio [142].

The CO:H2 ratio is affected by simultaneous occurrence of RWGS reactions (7.58)
and produces more CO. The steam produced enables the steam/carbon gasiﬁcation

The two side reactions (7.60) and (7.61), which generate coke deposits, are respon-
sible for catalyst deactivation and may damage the reactor [143]. Based on
Boudouard equilibrium [144], coke formation by CO disproportionation is less
favored at high temperatures (973 K and above). The highest carbon deposition
usually occurs on transition metal catalysts such as Ni, an otherwise interesting
catalyst, the cost of which is up to three orders of magnitude lower than noble
metals used in such a process (see below). In general, the dissociation of methane
occurs on a Ni surface to generate highly reactive Cα, which can be further gasiﬁed
by reactions with H2O, CO2, or H2 [144]. The encapsulation of Ni by carbon is the
major step for rapid growth of carbon nanotubes, which can block the catalyst and
plug the reactor system [145]. It is therefore important to design rationally a highly
active, stable, and economically viable catalyst system, which both kinetically
inhibits the coke formation and improves the conversion in the DRM reaction.
Throughout the past decades, researchers have tried to integrate DRM, SRM,
and partial oxidation of methane (POM) to mitigate the negative thermodynamics
of DRM and SRM. The concept of ‘tri-reforming” was introduced by Song
et al. [146]. It involves simultaneous reaction of methane with CO2, H2O, and O2,
and it is of practical interest because of the advantages it produces. A variable H2/
CO ratio can be obtained by adjusting the amounts of CO2, H2O, and O2 in the
feedstock. Carbon formation on the catalyst, which is a major issue in DRM, can
also be suppressed by the addition of H2O and O2 [147]. Finally, the exothermic
nature of POM reaction provides energy for the reforming process and hence
increases the energy efﬁciency. This is an interesting reaction concept, which
may help the industrial exploitation of DRM.

7.2.4.1
Catalytic Systems for the DRM Process
The catalysts used for the DRM process generally consist of noble metals (Rh, Pt,
Rh) and some transition metal catalysts such as Ru and Ni. Noble metals are used
for their resistance to corrosion and oxidation, high activity, and good carbon
resistance [148].
Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ru are known to reduce carbon deposition. Despite the high
activity and resistance against carbon formation, noble metals are also known for
their high cost and low availability. As such, low metal loadings have been
investigated in the DRM reaction. For example, Lercher et al. [149, 150] studied
the deactivation and coke accumulation during DRM reaction with a loading as low
as ca. 0.5–1 wt% Pt on zirconia. The size of the Pt particles and the stability of the
carbonates formed on the support (from CO2 activation) were found to be the
crucial factors in determining the rate of carbon formation. Smaller Pt particles
and supports such as zirconia with high afﬁnity for carbonate stability were found to
favor catalyst stability during the DRM. On the other hand, with Rh, the concen-
tration of accessible surface atoms seems to be the key factor, with an apparently
less important inﬂuence of the catalyst support [147]. In order to enhance the
catalytic performance, it is inevitable that higher loadings of active metals are
required. Most of the Group 8 transition metals (which are of lower cost compared
to noble metals) have shown promising catalytic performance for this reaction.
Nickel, among non-noble metals, is the one that has comparable activity to noble
metals [151]. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, nickel catalysts are prone to
catalyst deactivation caused by carbon formation. As such, there is a need for
suitable catalyst supports or promoters to be used to counteract extensive carbon
formation on Ni-based catalysts.
Several studies have been carried out aimed at synthesizing nickel-based cata-
lysts in the most suitable form for providing high activity and better carbon
resistance. Some of the nickel-based catalysts synthesized include bimetallic cata-
lysts, oxide-supported Ni catalysts, Ni-based perovskites, and Ni core-shell struc-
ture catalysts, which are discussed in this section.
As reported by Ruckenstein and Hu [152], DRM activity is enhanced by addition
of various promoters onto the catalyst surface. They have been found to be useful in
CO2 activation and for decreasing coke formation [153], and include oxides of
Group 2 elements or La, e.g., La2O3, MgO, BaO, and CaO, which also improve
metal dispersion [154, 155]. In addition, they contribute to a high catalytic activity
and stability, strong metal-support interaction, and lattice oxygen mobility, factors
of paramount importance for this reaction. Pan et al. [156] found that Ga2O3 on
SiO2 support activates adsorbed CO2 to form surface carbonate and hydrogen-
carbonate species. This leads to a more facile reaction with the deposited carbon
than the η1-O-linked CO2 or physically adsorbed CO2. Consequently, higher sta-
bility and coke resistance was achieved with Ga2O3-promoted SiO2-supported Ni
catalyst. A promotional effect by rare earth element over the catalytic DRM
performance of Ni–La2O3 catalysts was recently explored [157]. The Ni–La2O3
7.2
CO2 as Oxidant
267
catalyst doped with a small amount of Sr signiﬁcantly improves the DRM process,
even at temperatures as low as 873 K, with low carbon deposition. This was
attributed to the highly mobile surface oxygen species, which enable C–H bond
activation. The surface oxygen species can adsorb CO2 molecules, thus forming
bidentate carbonate species, which can facilitate carbon removal and result in
higher CO2 conversion. Similarly, the positive effect of alkaline metals was
observed on borated-alumina-supported Ni catalysts [158]. In this case, instead of
surface oxygen species, surface hydroxyl (OH) groups were found to play a
dominant role in oxidizing surface carbon species derived from methane
decomposition.
Bimetallic structures have been proposed as an alternative to single nickel metal
catalysts. Alloying with a second metal (either a noble metal or another transition
metal) results in the modiﬁcation of the catalyst properties caused by a “synergis-
tic” effect between the two metals [159]. For example, Oemar et al. [160] studied
the effect of Pd on Ni-based catalysts supported on yttria for the oxidative DRM
reaction. The formation of bimetallic Pd–Ni species enabled the catalyst to have a
good metal support interaction, and the presence of α-oxygen on Y2O3 surface was
beneﬁcial in dissociating methane. Because the amount of α-oxygen is very little, a
small amount of oxygen in the feed was required to regenerate the α-oxygen to
maintain the stability of the catalyst. Zhang et al. [161, 162] prepared Ni–Me
(Me¼Co, Fe, Cu, or Mn) bimetallic catalysts with the general formula Ni–Co–
Al–Mg–O using the coprecipitation method. Among bimetallic couples, Ni–Co
provided the best results with respect to catalyst stability and activity: it underwent
a 2 000-h stability test for DRM and no signiﬁcant catalyst deactivation was
observed. Perovskite-type catalysts represented by the general formula ABO3
(A ¼ lanthanide, B ¼ transition metal) have been widely investigated in high tem-
peratures applications because of their high thermal stability [65, 163]. In the
perovskite structure, the B-cation is surrounded octahedrally and the A-cation is
located in the cavity among the octahedral sites. A variation is the spinel oxide
Ni-based catalysts of formula ABO4 or A2BO4 [164]. The substoichiometric spinel
structures are active catalysts caused by (1) high dispersion of NiO into the spinel,
(2) stability of the structure at low temperature, or (3) formation of Ni phase in the
same temperature region than the catalytic reaction and presence of Ni oxide. The
latter is able to limit the growing of particles, probably by formation of interaction
between nickel metal out of the structure and Ni oxide of the structure [65,
165]. Gallego et al. [166] have used reduced La2NiO4 as catalyst precursor for
DRM at 973 K and have observed a conversion rate of 85 and 93 % for methane and
CO2, respectively, with no carbon deposition after 160 h of experiment. According
to the authors, the inhibition in carbon deposition was because of the enhanced
reaction between La2O2CO3 and the Ni–CHx species to produce CO and H2. In
addition, the high activity of the catalyst was attributed to the formation of the small
nickel particles (average diameter 7 nm) via reduction of the perovskite La2NiO4. A
recent investigation by Sutthiumporn et al. [167] on the performance of partially-
substituted LaSrNiO3 perovskite catalysts in DRM revealed that lattice oxygen
species in these perovskite catalysts are crucial in activating the C–H bond of the
268
7

methane molecule. In addition, carbon formation is reduced because of the reaction
with CO2 to form La2O2CO3. The Cu-substituted LaSrNiO3 catalyst was found to
display initially high methane conversion; because of the weak metal–support
interaction, the Ni particles agglomerate to form larger Ni particles, causing
lower catalytic stability. In contrast, although the Fe-substituted LaSrNiO3 catalyst
possesses lower initial DRM activity, a high activity and stability could be achieved
at prolonged reaction time as the Fe species begin to be reduced and the lattice
oxygen species become increasingly mobile as the reaction proceeds in the reduc-
ing environment. In summary, key issues of the reaction mechanism on this catalyst
are shown in Fig. 7.9 and are caused by (1) strong metal-support interaction,
hindering thermal agglomeration of Ni particles, and (2) the presence of the
abundant lattice oxygen species, which are not so active for C–H bond activation
but active enough to form La2O2CO3.
Spinel structures such as NiAl2O4 formed from the Ni/Al2O3 mixed oxide matrix
as a result of high temperature calcinations result in strong metal support interaction
[168]: the Ni–O bond in NiAl2O4 is stronger than in NiO crystals. However, the
bulk structure is difﬁcult to reduce and possesses lower activity at low reaction
temperatures. On the other hand, surface spinel structures are more desirable as they
are more active. Wang and Lu [169] have reported a higher activity and stability of
Ni/Al2O3 catalyst compared to Ni/CeO2 catalyst produced by strong metal support
interactions. Nevertheless, it has been reported by Bhattacharya and Chang [170]
that γ-alumina in the NiAl2O4 spinel structure formed via solid state reaction is
prone to transform into the α-phase, especially over prolonged reaction time at high
temperatures, resulting in gradual catalyst deactivation caused by sintering of the
alumina support. In a recent study, LaAlO3 perovskite oxide phase was pre-formed
on alumina-based support and calcined [171]. Upon further impregnation with Ni
and calcination steps, this structure was found to form a predominantly “inverse”
surface nickel aluminate. This catalyst was shown to be beneﬁcial in hindering the
phase transformation of the γ-alumina to α-alumina phase [171].
Spivey et al. [172] have recently reported some interesting works on structurally
stable lanthanum-zirconate pyrochlores (La2Zr2O7). The pyrochlore structures

(A2B2O7) are generally crystalline thermally stable ternary metal oxides with a
cubic unit cell. Similar to the perovskite structure, the A-site is typically a rare-earth
element (such as lanthanum) and the B-site is typically a transition metal element,
which has smaller ionic radius. Using an isotopic pulse technique, Spivey
et al. [153] have shown that activation of CO2 takes place on the La site of the
Rh-modiﬁed lanthanum-zirconate pyrochlore via formation of three polymorphs
(types I, Ia, and II) of La2O2CO3, of which only type II is reactive. Promotion with
higher amounts of Rh resulted in a greater number of Rh–La interfacial sites, which
were beneﬁcial in the surface carbon oxidation. Other metals such as Pt and Ru
have also been investigated, and Ru was found to exhibit a more interesting activity
compared to Pt in the pyrochlore structure [173, 174].
More recently, nanocatalysts have emerged as potential candidates for the DRM
reaction. The formation of nano-sized Ni particles facilitates high dispersion which,
in turn, has the tendency to minimize surface energy by increasing the interaction
with the support to prevent agglomeration [175–177]. For example, Corma
et al. [178, 179] have prepared delaminated Ni-ITQ-6 catalysts from silica, which
was tested for DRM reaction. The catalytic performance was compared with
conventional mesoporous silica-supported catalysts such as Ni/Silicalite-1 and Ni/
MCM-41. The presence of defect sites in delaminated ITQ-6 material was found to
permit high dispersion of Ni particles and prevent metal sintering, contributing to
its high activity and stability during DRM reactions.
Core-shell type of catalysts has emerged as a widely studied topic for various
catalytic processes. The metal@metal oxide nanoreactor core shell structure has the
potential to resist sintering under high temperature operations because of partial
blocking by the peripheral silica shells. However, in the past few years some
attempts have been made to investigate such catalysts for the DRM reaction. Li
et al. [180] developed Ni@SiO2 core shell catalysts and studied the effect of shell
thickness modiﬁcations for the DRM reaction. The high catalytic stability at
1 073 K was attributed to the formation of nickel phyllosilicate species with strong
interaction between the Ni core and silica shell. Upon reduction, the species formed
small satellite Ni particles within the silica shell, resulting in good catalytic DRM
performance at the optimum shell thickness of 11.2 nm. The schematic represen-
tation of this structure is shown in Fig. 7.10 [180].
Porous silica supports are gaining prominence for the preparation of highly
dispersed Ni particles. For instance, Cope
´ret et al. [181] successfully prepared
nano-ensembles of Ni on porous silica support for DRM reaction in a low temper-
ature range (below 823 K). This preparation method could effectively eliminate
particle size factors in investigating the competitive coverage of reaction interme-
diates, mostly *CHx, *O, and *CO on the nickel surface. Cope
´ret et al. [182] also
recently described a versatile method for the preparation of small Ni nanoparticles
on oxide supports via a colloidal approach. In this approach, Ni-silicide (Ni3–Si2)
colloids were prepared and dispersed on supports such as silica and ceria. In
particular, by dispersing these narrowly distributed supported particles on ceria,
the high oxygen storage capacity of ceria was found to improve signiﬁcantly the
performance of the reforming catalyst with 60 % higher Syngas productivity [182].

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
Recently Mo et al. [183] have developed a facile and economical method to
prepare highly dispersed Ni on silica via the core-shell precursor route. In this
method the catalyst was promoted with oleic acid (OA) (dNi < 3.0 nm) to form core-
shell (nickel nitrate species as core and nickel oleate as shell) precursor in the
impregnated solution. Further promotion with only 1 % La2O3 resulted in the
NiLaSi–OA catalyst achieving near equilibrium CO2 and methane conversions
(above 80 %) at 973 K with negligible carbon deposition even after 100 h on
stream. Figure 7.11 shows the TEM images of the NiLaSi catalyst with (A) and
without (B) OA promotion. It is evident that good dispersion can be observed upon
OA promotion on the catalyst, whereas agglomerated species are evident on the
unpromoted catalyst.
Therefore, the substantial progress achieved in catalyst development for DRM
clearly says that the key to optimize the carbon resistance and promotion of activity
lies in good catalyst dispersion and the promotion with adequate basic elements to
enhance CO2 adsorption in the DRM reaction. In addition, design and synthesis of
novel nanostructures pave the way for future co-implementation of DRM processes
in existing industrial systems.
7.2.4.2
Reaction Mechanism for the DRM Process
Numerous publications propose several reaction mechanisms for the DRM reac-
tion, and a variety of differing opinions because the mechanism depends on the type

7.2

of active metal and nature of support. Nevertheless, most of the proposed mecha-
nisms are based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) kinetic
models, where one reaction step is assumed to be slow and rate-determining, whilst
the others are at thermodynamic equilibrium [184]. The major steps involved in the
DRM reaction are dissociation of methane and CO2 followed by adsorption of
intermediates on the active sites leading to formation of products, i.e., CO, H2, and
H2O, that are eventually desorbed. Among these steps, activation of both methane
and CO2 play the dominant role in the DRM reaction.
7.2.4.2.1
Methane Activation
The most kinetically signiﬁcant step in the DRM reaction is the adsorption and
subsequent activation of methane which dissociates directly on the active metal,
forming carbon, CHx radicals or formyl intermediates, and hydrogen adatoms as
shown in Scheme 7.17 [154, 185, 186].

Scheme 7.17 Stepwise decomposition of methane on active metal sites
Even though the activation of methane is generally proposed to be taking place
on the metal sites [187], Zhang et al. [188] found that when Ni was supported on
more acid sites such as Al2O3 compared to the basic La2O3, the conversion of
methane was higher because the acid sites of the alumina support promoted
cracking of methane to carbon species. Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant drop in activity
was observed with time because of the greater amount of carbon deposition on the
more acid alumina.

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
According to Rostrup Nielsen and Bak Hansen [148], during the reforming
process there exists the possibility for the formation of three types of carbon
species, namely:
1. Whisker-type carbon (formation temperature above 723 K)
2. Encapsulating amorphous carbon formed via polymerization at temperatures
less than 773 K
3. Pyrolytic carbon nanotubes formed by methane cracking at temperatures above
873 K
The type of carbon formed depends on the reaction conditions, whereby higher
reaction temperatures favour the formation of the more inert-graphitic carbon
nanotubes. Based on kinetic and isotopic investigations on the mechanism of
DRM reaction over Ni/MgO catalysts, Wei and Iglesia [189] observed a similarity
in turnover rates and ﬁrst-order rate constants with methane decomposition. Hence,
they concluded that the dissociation is the kinetically relevant step for the DRM
reaction and that the Ni behavior resembles that of supported noble metal catalysts
(Rh, Pt, Ir, Ru).
According to Ferreira-Aparicio et al. [190], the supply of surface oxygen species
from the hydroxyls of the acidic supports can aid the formation of methoxo (CHxO)
species. Based on FTIR spectroscopy analysis of methane adsorption on alumina,
Li et al. [191] observed the presence of two hydroxyl signals at 3 750 and
3 665 cm1 which shifted to 3 707 and 3 640 cm1 upon adsorption of methane.
Their results indicate the possibility of weak interaction between methane and
surface hydroxyls, a phenomenon also observed with Ir catalysts during methane
decomposition [192]. Similarly, on perovskite- and pyrochlore-type catalysts, the
lattice oxygen species on the surface were found to assist the methane activation
[167, 174, 193].
The same authors have studied the effect of various metal substitutions, and have
found that Cu-modiﬁed catalysts possess the highest initial activity, whereas the
Fe-modiﬁed catalysts begin to improve in catalytic activity over time, reaching
results analogous to the Cu-substituted catalysts while showing a higher stability.
Based on XPS analysis of the various transition LSNM bimetallic perovskites
(Fig. 7.12a), it can be observed that lattice oxygen species (O2) at ca. 528–
529 eV exist in all the samples, and present a lower binding energy in LSN(Cu)O
compared to the LSN(Fe)O. This shows that the species is more mobile in the LSN
(Cu)O sample. On the other hand, the peak area of the deconvoluted O2 species in
the LSN(Fe)O is much higher than that of the LSN(Cu)O sample, indicating a
greater amount of lattice oxygen species. This phenomenon is generated by the
greater difference in electronegativity of Fe (Fe ¼ 1.83, and oxygen ¼ 3.44) com-
pared to Cu (Cu ¼ 1.91, oxygen ¼ 3.44). The authors conﬁrmed their analysis by
conducting methane -TPR experiments (Fig. 7.12b) which showed that methane
was activated at a higher temperature using the LSN(Fe)O sample compared to the
LSN(Cu)O sample. This difference in methane activation temperature correlates
with the lattice oxygen mobility of the respective perovskites, as shown by XPS
analysis, which eventually correlates with the catalytic stability [167].

7.2.4.2.2
CO2 Activation
The dissociation of CO2 depends on the nature of the catalyst support. On an acidic
or inert support such as SiO2, the CO2 chemisorption and dissociation occurs on a
transition metal surface and is dominated by electron transfer, requiring the forma-

However, the limitation in CO adsorption, based on the availability of the active
metal sites, results in severe accumulation of carbon deposits, which eventually
deactivate the catalyst. In the presence of basic catalytic sites or basic supports such
as La2O3, CO2 can easily be activated on basic sites, forming lanthanum

oxycarbonate species. For example, on a Ni/La2O3 catalyst, CO2 forms the
La2O2CO3 phase at the interface with Ni surface and participates in the formation
of CO. Under high temperature conditions the oxygen species in the lanthanum
oxycarbonate species acts as a scavenger of C and removes deposited carbon. This
is demonstrated by FTIR spectra as shown in Fig. 7.13.
Zhang et al. [194] proposed the following mechanistic steps, involving a
Ni/La2O3 catalyst, which has been found to be applicable to various other
lanthanum-based supports [157, 195]:
CH4 þ Nin ! C  Nin þ 2 H2
ð7:73Þ

Under the high temperature conditions of DRM reaction (above 873 K), the
lanthanum oxycarbonate species formed at the interfacial sites becomes mobile
and able to gasify the carbon species formed on the metallic nickel active sites. The
La2O3 acts as an intermediate that stores CO2 from the gaseous phase and releases it
to the active sites:
C  Nin þ La2O2CO3 ! 2 CO þ Nin þ La2O3
ð7:75Þ
Based on their FTIR study, Zhang et al. [194] observed signiﬁcant amounts of
formate species and considered that they may be formed by hydrogen spillover
from the Ni crystallites. Eventually, formates are thermally decomposed into H2O
and CO as follows:

Hence, this mechanism can explain the removal of carbon and the important role
played by basic sites on the supports.
7.2.4.3
Kinetic Modeling for the DRM Process
The rate-determining steps were found to vary depending on the nature of the
catalyst. Zhang et al. [194] found that methane activation is the rate-determining
step for DRM over the Ni/La2O3 catalyst, although the reaction between surface
carbon species via CH species and the oxidant (including CO2 activation) is the
rate-determining step over the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, Wang and
Lu [196] did a comprehensive study on DRM over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst within the
temperature range 773–973 K and showed that methane and CO2 both chemisorbed
on metallic Ni sites with CO formation as the rate-determining step. They proposed
the mechanism shown in Scheme 7.19, where [*] denotes the catalyst site.

Scheme 7.19 Proposed LHHW mechanism for DRM reaction over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
Wang and Lu [196] observed that the rate is ﬁrst order in methane, and it is ﬁrst
order in CO2 at lower partial pressures and zero order at high pressures. This
observation shows that, at higher partial pressures, CO2 may not be the rate-
determining factor.
With regards to the role of CO2 activation on support, Tsipouriari et al. [185]
proposed a mechanism of DRM over Ni/La2O3 catalyst. They observed that the
reversible adsorption of methane on the surface of nickel leads to the decomposition
276

of methane and production of carbon species and hydrogen. La2O2CO3 demon-
strated the direct afﬁnity of CO2 towards the basic support. In their proposed steps,
the adsorption of methane on the surface of Ni site was considered to be a reversible
reaction although the methane decomposition was the rate-limiting step. The
interaction between CO2 and La2O3 in the formation of La2O2CO3 was considered
to be an equilibrium reaction. Finally, the reaction of oxycarbonate species with
carbon deposited onto Ni particles was also considered to be a slow step. The
overall mechanism is shown in Scheme 7.20, where [*] denotes the catalyst site:

Hydrogenation of CO2
The thermodynamic stability of CO2 requires high energy substances or
electroreductive processes for its transformation into valuable chemicals in which
the carbon atom has a lower oxidation state than 4 [1, 3, 4, 197]. Catalytic
hydrogenation of CO2 has been acknowledged as one of the major potential steps
for CO2 valorization to fuels, or other products (e.g., HCOOH, methanol, H2CO,
and C1+) which are considered to be potential hydrogen carriers or useful
chemicals or fuels [1, 198].
Catalytic conversion of CO2 to high energy chemicals such as light oleﬁns and
liquid hydrocarbons can generally proceed via two routes: (1) conversion of CO2
into liquid hydrocarbons via CO formation (F-T route), which is a combination of
CO2 hydrogenation by RWGS and further hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons,
and (2) direct (without CO formation) hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol, DME,
higher alcohols, methane, and higher hydrocarbons. A common issue for such
processes is the production of hydrogen from renewable sources if large volumes
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2
277
of CO2 should be converted. Key issues are: (1) the stability of the CO2 molecule,
(2) the amount of H2 necessary to hydrogenate CO2, and (3) the kinetics of the
reaction [199]. Hence, it is highly crucial to employ suitable catalysts which can
decrease the energy barriers, thus resulting in lower energy states of the system.
Exploring the mechanistic pathways of such reactions may help to gain a deeper
insight into the feasibility of CO2 conversion at lower temperatures.
7.3.1
Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction (RWGS)
As already stated, Syngas is widely used to produce methanol or other long-chain
hydrocarbons. CO, which is considered to be the initial step of CO2 hydrogenation
on metal catalysts [200], can be formed in the RWGS reaction. Such a reaction is
crucial for the production of CO, which is an important precursor for various other
chemical productions [201].
This endothermic reaction, which occurs at high temperatures (>973 K), is
shown in (7.101).

However, several undesired parallel and side reactions tend to occur as well:

occur simultaneously any time H2O, CO, CO2, H2, C are present in the reaction
medium.
7.3.2
CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol and DME
7.3.2.1
Methanol
Methanol is a common feedstock considered as a building block in the chemical
industry because of its versatility in the synthesis of several important chemicals
such as chloromethane, acetic acid, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), alkyl halides,
and formaldehyde [202, 203]. Methanol can be converted into DME which is
278
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
attracting much attention as it can be used in fuel cells and diesel engines [204]. In
addition, methanol is used for the production of higher hydrocarbons (through the
methanol-to-gasoline route [205–207]) or of unsaturated hydrocarbons (through the
methanol-to-oleﬁns (MTO) or methanol-to-propene (MTP) routes).
Methanol is currently produced from Syngas as feedstock. The ﬁrst industrial
plant for methanol production was commissioned by BASF in 1923 using Syngas
and operated at a high pressure of 20 MPa and 573 K using zinc oxide/chromium
oxide catalysts [208].
Increasing concerns of the environmental impact of CO2 emissions have recently
led to increased research interest in the potential use of CO2 to replace CO in
methanol synthesis [209], although it requires one mol of hydrogen in excess. In
general, CO2 is gaining prominence as a substitute for toxic CO, derived from fossil
carbon [210], in several processes. Olah et al. [211] have promoted the use of
methanol as an alternative way to store, transport and use energy, and have
proposed the “Methanol Economy.” The hydrogen required for the chemical
recycling of CO2 must be sourced from water (by electrolysis or other cleavage
technologies using perennial energy sources) if the reduction of CO2 emission is
targeted. Currently, methane is also an interesting source for methanol as it is quite
abundant and can be found in many different environments, such as natural gas
deposits, shale gas, coal-bed methane, methane hydrate, and biomethane from
agricultural, domestic, and industrial waste [211].
Even though hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has favorable thermodynamics,
high activation energy barriers must be overcome and this requires the use of
appropriate catalysts. Formation of other by-products during CO2 hydrogenation,
such as CO, hydrocarbons, and higher alcohols [4], requires highly selective
heterogeneous catalysts with the important function of improving the process
sustainability. The reaction for methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation is
CO2 þ 3H2 ! CH3OH þ H2O
ΔH298K ¼ 49:5 kJmol1
ð7:105Þ
Thermodynamically, a decrease in reaction temperature or an increase in reaction
pressure can favor the synthesis of methanol. A reaction temperature higher than
513 K facilitates CO2 activation and, consequently, methanol formation [4, 5, 197].
7.3.2.2
DME
DME (CH3OCH3) is generally formed upon methanol dehydration but can be
directly produced by CO2 hydrogenation. DME is an efﬁcient alternative to
petroleum-based transportation fuels (because of its high cetane number) and
liqueﬁed natural gas, and has been found to have a low environmental impact
because it does not generate sulfur oxides or soot [211, 212]. In the chemical
industry, DME is a useful intermediate for the synthesis of chemicals such as
methyl acetate, dimethyl acetate, and light oleﬁns [213, 214]. Even though meth-
anol has been used in diesel engines, its low cetane number limits its application as
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2
279
a replacement for diesel fuel. In contrast, DME has about 40 % higher cetane
number compared to diesel fuel and is, thus, far superior compared to methanol for
such application. Two main pathways bring to DME from CO2: (1) a two-step
process, i.e., methanol is synthesized (7.105) on a suitable metal catalyst, which is
then dehydrated on an acid:
2CH3OH ! CH3OCH3 þ H2O

ð7:106Þ
catalyst (7.106) and, (2) a single-step process, using a bifunctional catalyst produc-
ing methanol and causing its dehydration in the same reactor, forming DME
[215]. Scheme 7.21 summarizes the thermodynamic properties of the conventional
(CO-based) synthesis of DME via the two-step process [213, 216, 217] as compared
to the one-step synthesis based on CO2.

The one-step process, which integrates the methanol synthesis and its dehydra-
tion to DME, reduces the investment and operational cost because only one reactor
is required [218]. A typical process ﬂow diagram is shown in Fig. 7.14. However,
for the one-step process, catalyst selection is extremely crucial to minimize CO
formation via RWGS reaction [217].
7.3.3
Catalytic Systems for CO2 Hydrogenation
Heterogeneous catalysts are generally used for most CO2 hydrogenation reactions.
A number of investigations have addressed the effects of active components,
supports, promoters, preparation methods, and surface morphology on CO2 hydro-
genation. The ternary CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly effective for the
RWGS and methanol/DME synthesis reactions [219–221]. In fact, Cu- and Cu/
ZnO-based catalysts, which are active for water gas shift (WGS) reactions, are also
active for the RWGS based on the principle of microscopic reversibility [2]. Cu has
280
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
good properties for catalyzing the RWGS reaction; hence it aids the preliminary
hydrogenation of the CO2 molecule. The combination of Cu with Zn further
accelerates the formation of methanol (because ZnO plays the role of inhibitor of
RWGS reaction) [205–207]. In addition, ZnO has a key role in the dispersion and
stabilization of the Cu active metal centers. Besides, the presence of lattice oxygen
vacancies in ZnO proves to be important for methanol synthesis [4, 202]. Other
modiﬁers such as Zr, Ce, Si, Al, V, Ti, Ga, B, Cr, La, and Fe have also been
explored [222].
Cu–ZrO2-based mixed oxide catalysts were reported to give better performances
compared to Cu–ZnO in CO2 hydrogenation [223–225]. The nanocrystalline form
of ZrO2 leads to higher catalyst surface areas compared to the conventional
catalysts prepared via the coprecipitation method and this leads to greater CO2
conversion and higher selectivity to methanol [226]. Sintering of Cu can lead to
poor thermal stability of the catalyst and Cu-based catalysts are deactivated at
temperatures higher than 573 K [200]. Cu/ZnO catalysts modiﬁed with Ga2O3 were
found to show superior stability and high catalytic activity and selectivity towards
methanol because of the ability of Ga2O3 to promote dispersion of Cu+ species on
the surface [227]. By supporting the combination of Cu/ZnO/Ga2O3 on hydropho-
bic silica, high activity and selectivity (>99 %) towards methanol in the tempera-
tures range 523–543 K was obtained [228]. Furthermore, addition of Ga2O3 and
Cr2O3 to Cu/ZnO catalysts can increase the selectivity towards DME production.
DME synthesis is usually accompanied by side reactions such as F-T synthesis and
WGS [229], and hence high selectivity, high activity, and high stability are
extremely important for this process.

7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2
281
The selection of the support is also a key issue in tuning the interactions between
the metal active site and the promoter and to ensure stability and good dispersion of
the catalyst [4]. Alternative catalyst formulations using various supports such on
Al2O3 [228, 230], ZnO [202, 231], ZrO2 [232, 233], CeO2 [234, 235], and SiO2
[200, 236] have been widely studied. For example, Bonura et al. [235] found that by
using CeO2 as support for the Cu–ZnO system, a high adsorption and easy spillover
of active hydrogen species across the ceria lattice contribute to enhance the
hydrogenation rate of intermediates such as formates. The increased metal support
interaction enhances the CO2 adsorption-activation process, resulting in a higher
concentration of formate moieties favoring higher reaction rates [235]. The water
formation in the dehydration of methanol to DME is the main reason for poor
results using the hydrophilic alumina carrier [237]. Al2O3 was anyway found to be a
more suitable support compared to TiO2 and SiO2 for the CO2 hydrogenation to
methanol [238]. A recent study by Arena et al. [237] dealt with the investigation of
the Cu–ZnO system on various supports such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 for CO2
hydrogenation to methanol. The ZrO2-supported system was found to promote
superior activity for methanol synthesis because of its positive inﬂuence on textural
and chemical effects, in addition to its acid/base features and ability to adsorb CO2.
The addition of M3+ ions such as Al3+ to Cu–ZnO-based catalysts has the beneﬁcial
effect of enhancing the Cu dispersion and the catalyst surface area [239]. With
respect to the methanol dehydration pathway for DME production, solid acid
catalysts such as HZSM-5, HMCM-49, HMCM-22, SAPOs, and ferrierite are
generally used [213]. Several studies have reported that the use of HZSM-5 favors
CO2 hydrogenation and methanol dehydration [240–242]. In the one-step process,
the bifunctional catalyst for DME production can create synergetic effects by
combining a hydrogenation component with a dehydration component [243]. For
example, An et al. [244] reported that CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–ZrO2/HSZM-5 catalyst
had a higher activity compared to the CuO–ZnO–Al2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst used for
CO2 hydrogenation to DME under high water concentrations. Addition of ZrO2
provides some variations in the porosity and microstructural features and can
positively affect the surface area, pore size distribution, and the reducibility of
the active centers. Besides, the CO2 hydrogenation capacity of the catalyst can be
further improved [235, 245, 246]. The activation of H2 and CO2 and the formation-
hydrogenation of the formate intermediate are greatly inﬂuenced by the neighbor-
ing metal and oxide sites reactivity on the Cu–ZnO/ZrO2 system [235, 247,
248]. The addition of chromium oxides to the Cu/ZrO2 metal-support combination
can positively suppress the sintering of Cu particles and enhance the catalyst
thermal stability by shifting the ZrO2 crystallization towards higher temperatures
[249]. The optimum distribution of basic sites on the catalyst is also important in the
selectivity towards methanol formation. Basic rare earths such as La2O3 can
actually increase the Cu surface area which, in turn, effectively enhances the CO2
conversion [250, 251].
Recently, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) have drawn increasing atten-
tion as catalyst support because of their unique features such as nanometer-sized
channels and sp2-C bonding, possessing high electron- and thermal-conductivity
and large surface area. Zha et al. [229] have deposited CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 and
282
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
HZSM-5 composite nanoparticles outside and inside the wall of carbon nanotubes
by ultrasonic assisted coprecipitation and have obtained higher DME yields when
the surface of the catalyst was functionalized with H2SO4/HNO3 mixture to
enhance the acidity. This system was found to perform better than conventional
CuO–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts in terms of improvement in CO2
conversion to DME. Zhang et al. [252] used Pd-decorated-CNT coupled to a Cu–
ZrO2 catalyst admixed with the HZSM-5 zeolite component. The Pd-decorated
CNT was found to have excellent capability to adsorb H2 and CO2, facilitating the
rate of CO2 hydrogenation, which resulted in it being 1.22 times that of the catalyst
without the Pd-CNT promotion.
Silica is commonly used as support because of some desirable properties such as
porosity, acidity, and thermal stability [211]. To enhance the strength of catalysts,
and especially for lower temperature operations, binders are sometimes added. At
higher temperatures, these binders are chemically reactive. For example, adding an
alumina binder to an Fe–K/Al2O3 catalyst has been shown to improve the activity
and selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons (C5+), whereas when using silica as
binder, the activity and selectivity dramatically decreased. This was attributed to
the change of catalyst acidity and of the structure and metal-support interaction,
which inﬂuence the activity and selectivity of the catalyst [253].
The most common methods used to enhance the thermal stability and selectivity
of catalysts include alloying with other metals. Iron is known to prevent active
centers from sintering as well as to favor the dispersion of the active centers on the
catalyst. Several studies have found that iron can potentially have a signiﬁcant role
in enhancing the catalyst stability, because reactions producing DME generate
more water and thus the catalyst can be affected by the hydrophilic properties of
ZnO [228]. The introduction of Fe into a Cu-based catalyst can result in a strong
bimetallic interaction between Cu and Fe, which facilitates strong CO2 and H2
adsorption, thus promoting the catalytic hydrogenation activity. Iron can act as a
textural promoter to prevent Cu sintering at higher temperatures, as well as to
protect Cu particles from being oxidized during the reaction [254]. There is an
increasing interest to understand better the catalyst structure-function relationships
so as to be able to design the optimal catalyst system [255]. Addition of Zr into the
CuO–Fe2O3/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst has been found to improve DME selec-
tivity [243]. As mentioned earlier, the catalysts for the one-step CO2 hydrogenation
to DME should be able to catalyze efﬁciently both the methanol synthesis and the
methanol dehydration, keeping the yield of CO formed via RWGS reaction to the
minimum level [218]. After alloying with noble metals such as Pd, the Cu–Zn–Al–
Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst has been found to enhance remarkably DME production,
whilst retarding CO formation. This was attributed to the spillover effect of
hydrogen from Pd to the neighboring phase [256].
Cobalt catalysts are widely used for the traditional Fisher–Tropsch synthesis
based on CO and H2. Despite being active for CO2 hydrogenation, Co catalysts
have been found to promote the formation of undesired methane [257]. By
replacing the Syngas feed-stream with CO2 and H2, it was found that cobalt is
prone to be more selective towards methanation rather than methanol or other
alcohol production [4, 258, 259]. However, it is important to ensure that the catalyst
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2
283
composition is such to minimize the methanation reaction for an efﬁcient and
economically feasible liquid-fuel synthesis based on CO2 hydrogenation. Methane
is considered a “low value” molecule, which unnecessarily consumes 4 mol of
hydrogen per CO2 [238]. Mixed Fe/Co catalysts have also been shown to give low
selectivity towards the desired hydrocarbons [4]. Based on the study carried out by
Akin et al. [260] on Co/Al2O3 catalyst, considering the higher amount of methane in
the product stream, the CO2 hydrogenation pathway was proposed to imply surface
bound intermediates of H–C–O and O–H. Likewise, nickel is also found to favor
methanation reactions [261–264]. For example, Chang et al. [262] have reported
that Ni, when highly dispersed on amorphous silica, can afford a high turnover
frequency for methane production. On suitable supports, such as ceria, it has been
reported that high activity and stability for RWGS reaction can be achieved.
According to Wang et al. [265], the main active sites for the RWGS reaction are
the vacancies present in the CeO2 as well as the highly dispersed Ni species. The
incorporation of Ni in the CeO2 lattice can also modulate the properties of the
catalyst [266]. Recently, Zonetti et al. [266] have synthesized the NixCe0.75Zr0.25–
xO2 solid solution, where Ni was dissolved in the lattice structure by coprecipitation
or impregnation techniques. The high activity and stability for 60 h was attributed
to the active sites being the interface of Ni metal with the NiCeZr interface. Based
on temperature programmed desorption studies, the authors postulate that the
catalysts seem to promote both associative (related to carboxyl and formate inter-
mediates) as well as redox mechanisms.
Several innovative catalyst preparation routes have also been adopted by differ-
ent research groups to improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic
systems for CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The recent trend is to produce and use
nanoparticles, which have higher surface area compared to conventional catalysts.
The superior activity of Cu nanoparticles compared to conventionally prepared Cu
(111) for methanol and other liquid hydrocarbon synthesis relate to the presence of
more active corner sites as well as structural ﬂexibilities, which can reduce the
activation energy of the rate-determining steps. For example, Chen et al. [200] have
used the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) method to improve the thermal stability of
Cu/SiO2 catalysts for RWGS reaction. This ALE preparation method proved to be
effective in the formation of small Cu nanoparticles, which could strongly bind CO,
resulting in high activity for RWGS reaction [200]. Another method is the modi-
ﬁcation by functionalization of Cu on SiO2 using organic precursors such as oleic
acid and butyric acid. This facile and cheap preparation method was reported by Mo
et al. [267] who tested the catalytic performance of the catalysts in the WGS
reaction. Coteron and Hayhurst [268] found that the “spark erosion” preparation
method resulted in high methanol selectivity. The sol gel preparation technique was
found to boost the total and metal surface areas [223, 269], whereas the “combus-
tion” route could result in enhanced turnover frequency [231]. On the other hand,
the oxalate coprecipitation method has been found to exhibit ﬁne and uniformly
distributed catalyst particles, resulting in high catalytic activity for CO2 hydroge-
nation to methanol [270, 271]. It has also been established that the citrate precursor
method can result in solid catalyst formation with high surface area [272, 273]. Via
this method, a homogeneous gel (containing the metal precursors) is formed by
284
7
Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
complexing the metal nitrate salts with citric acid. Hence, such a coprecipitation
technique can ensure that the various precursors are adequately mixed during the
solid formation step [224, 274]. Using simple solid state reaction techniques, Guo
et al. [275] have prepared Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts from hydrated metal salts using
citric acid as ligand, and have found that the calcination temperature greatly affects
the catalytic activity in the reaction of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The
calcination temperature of 673 K gave the optimum performance, whereas above
873 K an undesirable phase transformation of ZnO from tetragonal to monoclinic
takes place, which decreases the dispersion of the Cu species.
7.3.4
Reaction Mechanism for CO2 Hydrogenation
In the CO2 hydrogenation, three reactions are main competitors, namely RWGS,
methanol synthesis, and DME production [244, 276, 277]. The methanol and DME
production reactions have a slower rate in reaching thermodynamic equilibrium
compared to RWGS reaction.
7.3.4.1
Reaction Mechanism for RWGS
It has generally been assumed that most of the reaction mechanisms that occur for
WGS are also applicable for RWGS. The two main mechanisms proposed for WGS
reactions are (1) surface redox mechanism and (2) dissociative mechanism of water
to afford OH and H species, with subsequent formation of formate species (HCO2–
M, obtained by an attack of OH groups on M–CO moieties) or metalla carboxyl
species (MO2H, which might result from the reaction of M–H moieties with CO2 or,
even better, by protonation of metal-bound CO2; see Chaps. 2 and 4) as
intermediates [200].
7.3.4.1.1
Surface Redox Mechanism
The main concept of surface redox mechanism is represented by the oxidation and
reduction cycle of the active sites. For example, with Cu-based catalysts, Cu0 atoms
provide active sites for the dissociation of CO2 (7.109). The reduction of the
oxidized Cu catalyst (7.110) should be faster than the oxidation process [200,
278] according to Scheme 7.22 [219].

Hydrogenation of CO2

Gines et al. [219] have studied the kinetics and mechanism involved in RWGS over
commercial and laboratory CuO/ZnO/Al2O3-based catalysts. Their results show that
the composition of the H2/CO2 mixture has a tremendous role, as the reaction shifts
from ﬁrst order in H2 to ﬁrst order in CO2 depending on the pressure of the two gases
[219]. Hence, they surmised that the surface redox mechanism pathway is formed by
the presence of subsurface hydrogen trapped on the reconstructed copper surface
caused by oxygen overlayer as also postulated by Waugh [279]. This serves in making
the surface more reactive to CO2 adsorption. The changes of the surface reactivity and
of the rate-limiting reagents were taken into consideration in the formulation of the
redox mechanism reported in Scheme 7.23.

7.3.4.1.2
Dissociative Mechanism
The dissociative mechanism involving formate intermediates has been widely
considered as the major route for CO production in the RWGS reaction [280–
282]. With Cu as the catalyst active site, the formate species derived from associ-
ation of H2 and CO2 is mainly proposed to be the key intermediate for CO
production [281, 282]. Several studies have been carried out to improve the formate
species decomposition to CO [282–284].
For example, Chen et al. [283] have added potassium to Cu/SiO2 and have found
that the enhancement of CO2 adsorption on K2O is the important factor, which
results in improved catalytic activity for RWGS reaction. By using temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) of H2/CO2, they suggested the mechanism reported
in Scheme 7.24. According to them, H atoms are produced on copper and spill over
to associate with CO2 adsorbed on K2O, forming formates which can be
decomposed to CO and H2O. Yoshihara and Campbell [282] investigated a similar
system and proposed the possibility that formate species are formed on potassium,
migrate to Cu, and then decompose to CO:
K  CO2 þ Cu  H ! K  ðHCOOÞ þ Cu ! K þ Cu  ðHCOOÞ
ð7:114Þ
It was also postulated that CO2 adsorbed on K2O may also migrate to Cu and
then associate with H atom forming formate species [282].

Reaction Mechanism for Methanol Synthesis
Despite the numerous theories on the mechanistic pathways for the methanol
synthesis, and the extensive investigation, there is still uncertainty about the
deﬁnition of the role of Cu, Cu+, Cu–Zn alloy, and the carrier sites [222]. In
the past, it has been assumed that CO hydrogenation is the main pathway for
methanol synthesis. However, isotopic labeling experiments conducted by
Chinchen et al. [285] have revealed that methanol is formed directly from CO2,
whilst CO scavenges the oxygen atoms which hinder the active metal sites
[237, 286].
According to earlier proposed mechanisms, formate hydrogenation on Cu/ZnO
catalysts is the rate-limiting steps. This was based on data reported by Fujitani
et al. [287] who found that the formate coverage on Cu/ZnO catalysts is propor-
tional to the turnover frequency for methanol formation. The proposed reaction
pathway is shown in Scheme 7.25.

Arena et al. [288] have conducted a detailed study to probe the solid state
interactions, adsorption sites, and functionality of ZnO-promoted Cu/ZrO2 systems
for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. They found that ZnO promotes the Cu disper-
sion because of strong Cu–ZnO interaction, whereas presence of ZnO on the ZrO2
support markedly enhances the surface for CO2 adsorption. Based on various FTIR
and TPD studies, they have proposed that the hydrogenation of the reactive formate
intermediate on ZnO and ZrO2 surface sites in the vicinity of Cu is the rate-limiting
step. The metallic Cu sites, the hydroxyl groups of ZrO2, and the basic Lewis sites
of ZnO were proposed to play vital roles in the main CO2 hydrogenation pathway as
shown in the proposed mechanism in Scheme 7.26 [288].

Carbon Dioxide Conversion in High Temperature Reactions
Arena et al. [237] have recently further extended their previous work on Cu–Zn/
ZrO2 and carried out some kinetic studies. They have demonstrated that methanol
is the main reaction product at pressure > 0.1 MPa and low temperature (473 K),
whereas CO is formed via both parallel RWGS and consecutive methanol decom-
position paths, mainly at higher temperatures (>473 K) (Scheme 7.27). The
authors have emphasized the essential role of the metal/oxide interface for the
CO2 hydrogenation, enabling the adsorption of CO2 on basic sites of ZnO and
ZrO2 in the vicinity of the hydrogenation sites provided by Cu0. The recent kinetic
studies correlate to the originally proposed mechanism in which the rate-limiting
step was suggested to be the formation and hydrogenation of the dioxomethylene
reactive intermediate on ZnO and ZrO2 surface sites in the interface with
Cu. It should be noted that the dioxomethylene intermediate, which plays such a
key role according to the authors, is only rarely mentioned by other authors and has
not been identiﬁed, neither via experimental nor theoretical studies. It seems
certain that the support may play a key role in driving the mechanism in different
directions.
Scheme 7.27 CO2 hydrogenation reactions network of supported Cu–ZnO catalysts [237]
Zhang et al. [289] have used DFT studies to gain insight on the effect of surface
hydroxyls on CO2 hydrogenation over Pd/γ-Al2O3 and have deciphered the
elementary steps leading to the formation of HCOO and CO, which are important
intermediates for methanol and methane formation. The results are summarized in
Scheme 7.28 as a simpliﬁed potential energy diagram considering different sites:
i.e., Pd4 cluster on dry-γAl2O3 support (D(Pd4)), Pd4 cluster on hydroxylated-γ
Al2O3 support (H(Pd4)), and ideal Pd(111) surface. The highest barrier for CO2
conversion to HCOO and CO is found on four-atom Pd (Pd4) clusters. Such data
show that CO is the initial product of CO2 hydrogenation and therefore the Pd
cluster on a dry alumina surface is likely to lead to dominant formation of
methane. However, for the Pd cluster on hydroxylated alumina, HCOO is the
initial product and hence can lead to dominant formation of methanol. On the
other hand, for the Pd(111) surface, both CO and HCOO are dominant products of
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2

the initial CO2 hydrogenation, meaning there is no obvious selectivity towards
either methane or methanol production. Their results also show that the surface
hydroxyls, despite an initial greater selectivity towards methanol, result in weak-
ened Pd-support interaction, thus destabilizing the catalyst. It was, thus, proposed
that the Pd/γ Al2O3 catalyst system requires modiﬁcation and promoters in order
to improve the Pd dispersion or to control the hydroxylation prevalent on
alumina-based supports.

D(Pd4), H(Pd4), and Pd(111) surfaces, respectively. Only the transition state (TS) with the highest
barrier for each path is shown [289]
Using Pd/Ga2O3 systems [290–292], it was established that the reaction
intermediates were chemisorbed onto gallia forming (bi)carbonates, which
were successively hydrogenated to mono-, bidentate- and bridged-formate,
methylenebisoxy and methoxy species as shown in Scheme 7.29 [292]. It was
revealed that the bimetallic Pd-Ga particles were responsible for the CO2 hydro-
genation to methanol and it was postulated that the methoxo/methanol formation
from H2/CO2 took place as a consequence of monodentate formate hydrogena-
tion, whereas the bridged formate behaved more as a spectator or laggard
reaction intermediate [291]. These authors also invoke the methylenebisoxy
species as an intermediate in the hydrogenation of formate to the methoxo
moiety.

Scheme 7.29 Proposed reaction pathway for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation over
Pd/Ga catalyst [292]
Initial research work generally focused on the industrial Cu–ZnO/Al2O3 systems
because of favourable economics of using alumina as catalyst carrier for industrial
applications. Hence, based on such a conﬁguration, Sun et al. [293] utilized the
DRIFTS spectroscopy method (Fig. 7.15) and observed that methanol was directly
formed from CO2 hydrogenation. Based on their proposed mechanism shown in
Scheme 7.30, in the absence of CO, dissociative adsorption of CO2 takes place on
the catalyst surface, with a greater tendency to go through pathway (I) in
Scheme 7.30. Even if the reaction proceeds through pathway (II) (Scheme 7.30),
the surface (O¼C–OH)s species could decompose to COs and OHs because of the
absence of CO gas phase. However, in the presence of CO in the CO2/H2 system,
the reaction proceeds towards pathway (II) to form (O¼C–OH)s, which then
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2

isomerizes to form bidentate formate species that cannot easily decompose to COs
and OHs, thus enhancing the methanol production rate. These authors too mention
the methylenebisoxy species as key intermediate towards the formation of methoxo
species from formate.

On the other hand, with incorporation of ZrO2 in the catalyst system, Lim
et al. [246] have developed a kinetic model for methanol synthesis for Cu/ZnO/
Al2O3/ZrO2 based on the rate-determining steps for the various complex reaction
networks. Such a model was tested and applied for various CO2 partial pressures.
On the basis of their experimental data (as shown in Scheme 7.31), the rate-
determining steps were found to be the surface reaction of a methoxo species (for
CO hydrogenation reaction), the hydrogenation of a formate (HCO2) intermediate
(for CO2 hydrogenation reaction), and the formation of a formate intermediate (for
the WGS reaction), respectively. However, a certain optimum threshold of CO2 as a
reactant was found to be required in order to ensure maximum methanol synthesis.

7.3.4.3
Reaction Mechanism for DME Synthesis
Study of the mechanism for the one-step CO2 hydrogenation to DME is still in its
infancy, as most studies are devoted to the optimization of the bifunctional catalyst.
Chen et al. [213] have conducted a kinetic and thermodynamic study on the DME
production via the direct synthesis route over a bifunctional Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/
HZSM-5 catalyst at various pressures. Their studies reveal that DME production
is governed by two different factors above or below 498 K. At the lower temper-
atures (<498 K), the reaction is dominated by chemical kinetics, whereas for the
higher temperatures (>498 K), the thermodynamic equilibrium dominates the
reaction.
7.3
Hydrogenation of CO2
293
Based on a recent study on the Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 system, the reaction
pathway is proposed to be a multi-site reaction, taking place with the primary
formation of methanol and the consecutive production of DME on the acid sites
of the zeolite framework from methanol dehydration [218]. According to Frusteri
et al. [218], on the Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 system, H2 is initially adsorbed and
activated (H2
*) on the Cu sites, thus resulting in reduction of the Cu species,
whereas CO2 is bridge adsorbed on the basic surface sites of ZnO and ZrO2 forming
activated CO2 (CO2
*). Thereafter, the H2
* spillover to CO2
* leads to formation of
intermediate species (such as formate/dioxomethylene/methoxy) stabilized at the
metal-oxide interface prior to evolving as methanol from the hydrogenation reac-
tion [228, 294].
Scheme 7.32 Reaction scheme for the direct CO2 hydrogenation to DME [217]
Based on the thermodynamic evaluation by Bonura et al. [217], the conversion
of methanol to DME on the acidic zeolite sites rapidly approaches the equilibrium
level at all the investigated temperatures because it is a fast reaction. Moreover,
they also observed a promoting effect of the reaction temperature on the relative
rate of methanol synthesis from CO2 rather than CO, on the basis of thermodynam-
ics. Hence, based on their ﬁndings, the authors have proposed the reaction in
Scheme 7.32. It turns out that, apart from the methanol dehydration reaction,
3 which takes place very fast at any temperature, reactions 1–2–4 affect the
methanol formation depending on their relative reaction rates. The thermodynamic
analysis of the main reaction paths involved in the synthesis of DME by CO2
hydrogenation reveals that, under kinetic conditions, the CO concentration dramat-
ically increases with temperature; therefore, low reaction temperature and recycling
unreacted COx/H2 mixtures could be a solution to improving the methanol/DME
productivity.

Conclusions
CO2 can act either as a “soft oxidant” for DH for oleﬁn production or can be
hydrogenated itself to afford CO, methanol (or methane), and DME. Such reactions
make a complex network, inter-related not only in terms of reaction pathways
(Scheme 7.33) but also in terms of the catalysts used.
Most of the high temperature reactions associated with the use of CO2 as oxidant
involve the role of CO2 as mediator in saturated hydrocarbon conversion into oleﬁn
with the release of hydrogen. The reaction pathways are mainly determined by the
nature and properties of the catalyst, i.e., redox properties or acid–base properties,
and supports. For example, a redox-based catalyst such as ceria or vanadia would
promote the redox-type mechanism to take place. Prevalent issues for the produc-
tion of oleﬁns are the low selectivity and yield. Several studies have shown that
selectivity can be enhanced using CO2 as “soft-oxidant.” Further improvement of
conversion yield and selectivity is a focal research point. On the other hand, the role
of CO2 in hydrocarbon reforming (albeit at higher temperatures than DH for oleﬁn
production) is an interesting route for Syngas production. The catalysts used are
mainly nickel-based (which are more active in reforming than in oleﬁn production).
The main issue in this reaction, which produces Syngas with a H2:CO ratio equal to
1, is the catalyst deactivation caused by carbon formation. Recent advances in the
synthesis of highly dispersed nanocatalysts appear to be promising in terms of
carbon resistance. Co-reforming the hydrocarbon with CO2, oxygen and steam
(tri-reforming process) is a strategy for increasing the H2/CO ratio of the Syngas
in less energy-requiring conditions, because the POM contributes heat to the
reacting system.
Today, Syngas is used for downstream production of methanol (which is a
building block for the production of other chemicals). The simplest CO2 hydroge-
nation reaction is the RWGS reaction, which converts CO2 into CO, that can then be
used for methanol production. Instead of going through the Syngas route, methanol
and DME can be produced directly via CO2 hydrogenation. The most widely used
catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation are Cu-based. This route seems to be more
efﬁcient. More and more evidence of its existence has recently been gained,
changing the belief that CO2 is ﬁrst converted into CO and then the Syngas route
is followed. Catalysts that are good for RWGS can also be modiﬁed and utilized for
direct methanol synthesis from CO2. Methanol molecules can undergo further
dehydration to produce DME in a separate process, but the direct conversion of
CO2 to DME in a single reactor is now being considered. Such an approach requires
modiﬁcation of the methanol synthesis catalysts so as to have acid functions to
promote DME formation.
As a conclusion, the use of CO2 as a carbon source for the synthesis of various
energy rich molecules via the high temperature reactions discussed in this chapter
shows great potential for industrial exploitation on a large scale. Rational designs of
active catalysts play a key role in terms of improvement towards reaction activity
and selectivity. The use of solar energy via solar power concentrators would be

Energy-Richer Molecules: Some
Thermodynamic and Kinetic Facts
Abstract This chapter deals with the mechanism of reduction of “free” and
coordinated CO2 by electron transfer. One-e and multi-e transfer pathways are
compared energetically and their role in the conversion of CO2 into higher energy
C1 or C1+-species is highlighted. The state of the knowledge is presented through
the analysis of reference cases.
8.1
Introduction
Electron transfer to CO2 experiences both thermodynamic and kinetic hindrance.
The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of formation of several C1 molecules is
represented in Fig. 8.1. It says that if CO2 has to be converted into species in
which the C-oxidation state is lower than +4, energy is needed – if not also
hydrogen. With the exception of CO, which can be produced from CO2 through
routes that may or may not involve hydrogen (CO2 splitting to afford CO and “O”
does not require hydrogen), all other C1 molecules have an H-to-C ratio higher than
the value in CO2, where it is zero. This means that the reduction process requires
“H” or “e plus H+” transfer. The source of “H, H+” must be water if the reduction
of the heterocumulene is to be performed large scale. Using water as a source of
hydrogen, in principle, the reduction of CO2 can be performed following two quite
different routes: (1) electrolysis of water to afford H2 and use of the latter in thermal
catalytic reactions with CO2 bearing to energy-rich C1 or C1+ molecules;
(2) electro-co-processing of CO2 and water to afford C-reduced species. The two
routes are quite different; the former requires production and possibly storage of H2,
whereas the latter directly converts CO2 into its reduced forms without any need for
a preliminary production of H2. In this chapter, the latter option is discussed.
In Chap. 1, it was said that CO2 can be reduced through a 1-e transfer to the
radical anion CO2
. Figure 8.1 shows that any reduction of CO2 to other C1 species
is an “n  2e” reduction. A process that may be born from the transfer of “1e” to
CO2 is the synthesis of C–C bonds. For example, the C2 species oxalic acid (HO2C–
CO2H), in which the oxidation state of C is +3, can be formed by coupling two
CO2
. units followed by protonation; the direct carboxylation of hydrocarbons

forming carboxylic acids (R–H + CO2 ! R–CO2H), in which again the formal
oxidation state of C in CO2 is +3, is another interesting reaction. As observed in
Chaps. 1 and 2, the 1e transfer to CO2 can also originate a second species that is
the carbonyl-carbonate, OC(¼O)–OC(¼O), obtained upon coupling of CO2 with
CO2
. and subsequent transfer of a second electron to the product of coupling. The
fate of such a product was discussed in Chap. 2.
However, several questions may arise in the mind of the reader, such as, Are
radical CO2
. anions to be likely intermediates in the synthesis of other C1
molecules? Is such one-electron transfer thermodynamically more or less feasible
than a multielectron process? Is the multielectron transfer a process occurring at
different potentials for each e-transfer? Or are iso-potential (iso-energetic) syn-
chronous multiple e-transfers possible? It has also been shown in Chaps. 1 and 2
that when a metal interacts with the C atom of CO2, or electrons are transferred to
the same atom, the molecular geometry of the latter is dramatically changed and the
change requires the reorganization of the energy levels of the molecular orbitals.
Does such a geometry change represent an inﬂuential barrier to the reduction of
CO2? Therefore, do the facility of coordination and the mode inﬂuence the 1e–2e
transfer? The electroreduction of CO2 is not a trivial case. In this chapter, an answer
to such questions is attempted, and the state of our knowledge is presented.
8.2
Key Steps and Aspects in CO2 Reduction
The potentials of the various reactions of reduction of CO2 to other C1 molecules
are shown in Table 8.1. It is quite evident that the one-electron transfer is a process
that requires higher energy than the multi-electron transfers. If the reductions are
considered to take place in water, then it is useful to recall the Frost diagram built by
correlating the number of electrons transferred in a process and the free energy
change (or electrochemical potential; Table 8.1) of that process (Fig. 8.2).
An important message from such a diagram is that any species that lies above a
line joining two other different species to which it is correlated is not stable with
Fig. 8.1 Free Gibbs energy
of formation for CO2 and
other C1 molecules

respect to the latter two and converts into them. So, for example, formaldehyde,
which lies above the line joining carbon monoxide and methanol, converts into the
latter two species. If coordinated CO2, more than free CO2, has to be reduced, then a
key step in the entire reduction process is the bonding of CO2 to the metal centre.
This part was discussed in Chap. 2, where it was shown that ligands may inﬂuence
the mode of bonding of CO2 to the metal centre. Moreover, carrying out the
electroreduction in water requires that the metal centre is stabilized by ligands
with a good water afﬁnity, proper donor properties and correct steric hindrance.
Consequently, N- or O-ligands are more frequently used than phosphanes, unless
the latter are conveniently functionalized (for example with sulphonic groups or
other water soluble moieties) for enhancing their water solubility or mixed organic-
water solvent media are used. Figure 8.3 presents a list of N-ligands, from the
historical ones such as cyclam used in the ﬁrst studies in this ﬁeld and Fig. 8.4 lists
some of the P-ligands used in electrochemical reductions. Table 8.2 highlights the
electroreduction of CO2 and showcases the electrodes and the catalyst used, the
products obtained, the operative conditions, the yield, efﬁciency and selectivity.
Another important factor that inﬂuences the reduction process is the solvent.

noted that water is not one of the best solvents for CO2 (Fig. 8.5). At 293 K its value
(0.034 mol/L) is very close to one order of magnitude lower than in acetone, and
lower than that in most organic solvents. The low solubility of CO2 in water sets the
limit to operative parameters such as the current density (usually below 10 mA m2),

and the diffusion limitation inﬂuences the kinetics of a process. Water is often added
to organic solvents as a source of protons when the latter are necessary. As discussed
above, multielectron transfer coupled to proton transfer produces better energetic
conditions for CO2 reduction. In such a case, up to ca. 1 vol.% water can be added
without changing the solubility of CO2 in the organic solvent. The use of devices
which operate under pressure [32] is now attracting much attention in order to
eliminate barriers caused by the low concentration of CO2 in solution; gas diffusion
electrodes, which concentrate CO2, mimicking natural systems, are also used to this
end [33]. The equilibria which occur in water ((8.1)–(8.4)) make the situation much
more complex as CO2 is present in water in many different forms which have
completely different behaviours and reactivities. The equilibria are inﬂuenced by
the pH of the solution and Fig. 8.6 [32] gives the abundance of the various species as
a function of the pH of the solution. The concentration of [CO2] in a given pH
condition represents its solubility whereas the sum of the concentrations of all the
species is the “apparent” solubility of CO2 under the selected conditions. This is an
important distinction as the reactivity of [CO2] is different from that of hydrogen
carbonate or carbonate and different conditions may be required. However, it is
important to refer to [CO2] and to know what is its real value at a given temperature
and pH in a solvent.
A paradox is that in a basic solution (pH ¼ 10) a much greater amount of CO2 is
captured in water than at pH ¼ 7, but the available [CO2] at pH ¼ 10 is almost equal
to zero, although it is appreciable at pH ¼ 7 (Fig. 8.6). Consequently, basic condi-
tions are not suitable for studying the reactivity of CO2 itself: other species such as
HCO3

Scheme 8.1 Direct (A) and catalyst-mediated (B) electroreduction of CO2 in solution
Another key fact is that the electroreduction of CO2 may take place at the
electrode surface or be mediated by a catalyst attached to the electrode or soluble
in the solvent (Scheme 8.1). In case (A) the reaction occurs at the surface of the
electrode which directly transfers electrons to CO2: this generally requires high
overvoltage and may cause electrode deterioration or even consumption and scarce
selectivity. In case (B) the electrode transfers electrons to the catalyst which then
interacts with CO2 causing its reduction. In such a case, CO2 is not in contact with
the electrode, and this results in better stability of the electrode and its longer life,
which may be important in the overall costing determination of a process.
Another advantage of electrocatalysis is that overvoltages are reduced almost to
zero and the electron transfer occurs near the thermodynamic potential of the
reaction, e.g. E(substrates/products), which one wishes to perform.

Scheme 8.2 Efﬁciency in the conversion of solar energy, water and CO2 into fuels
In addition to electrochemical reduction (EC), photoelectrochemical (PEC)
reduction is playing a more and more important role. In PEC reduction, a
photoactive material is attached to the electrode surface and the excitons produced
upon irradiation generate electrons used for the reduction process. Alternatively,
photochemical (PC) processes can be used in which semiconductors produce
excitons upon irradiation and generate electrons and holes used in the reduction
of CO2 and oxidation of an electron donor (water should be used). All such
methodologies have in common the “electron plus proton” transfer to CO2.
Recently the use of solar energy for powering the reduction of CO2 is much
under consideration as this would represent a way to convert low-value CO2 into
useful chemicals and fuels, mimicking nature and natural photosynthesis. The use
of PV as source of electrons in reduction reactions is receiving much attention today
as it may represent an effective way to the conversion of large volumes of CO2. As a
matter of fact, the use of PV for CO2 reduction using water as electron donor is
already an attractive technology, although the cost may appear high. From the solar
to chemicals/fuels (StC/F) energy conversion point of view, it must be pointed out
that the most ready technology is based on the sequence shown in Scheme 8.2.
Having said that, we can now consider in detail the electron-transfer processes
and catalysts in pathways for CO2 (and water) conversion into fuels.
8.3
One-Electron Transfer to CO2 vs Multi-electron
Transfer
The one-electron transfer to free CO2 affords CO2
., as seen in Chap. 1. Table 8.1
shows that it requires much more energy than multielectron transfers. Moreover,
the potential is dependent on the medium in which the electron transfer occurs:
polar media (1.9 V) or apolar media (2.21 V). The one-electron transfer
generates the CO2
. species which can evolve according to two different routes
(Scheme 8.3).

Scheme 8.3 Reaction mechanisms for the conversion of the radical anion CO2

The radical anion CO2
. has a life as short as microseconds, as discussed in
Chap. 1. It can be stabilized by interaction with the solvent or radical traps. It can
attack a second CO2 molecule via a hetero O–C coupling and generate the dianion
[A], in Scheme 8.3 which can be the source of CO and carbonate, as already seen.
However, by protonation, the following couple of products can be obtained: either
CO and hydrogencarbonate HCO3
 or CO2 and formate HCO2
.
Vice versa, the homo C–C coupling of two radical anions with antiparallel spin
of the electron localized on C produces the oxalate anion [B]. The e-transfer to
“free” CO2 has been attempted for the synthesis of oxalates, with alternate fortune
[34]. Whether the homo-coupling or the hetero-coupling is favoured depends on
several parameters such as the solvent, the current density, and the electrode.
All anions need a cation for neutralization, which is provided by the electrode, in
general, which is consumed. Such technology is scarcely exploited at the industrial
level.
8.4
Competitive Coordination of CO2 and H+ to a Catalytic
Centre and Their Reduction
When the electron transfer involves CO2 coordinated to a metal centre, then several
factors determine both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction. Such
factors can be categorized as follows: the metal, the nature and structure of the
ligand, the geometry of the metal-complex, the solvent: they may affect the electron
transfer process in many ways. Moreover, the addition of a proton to the metal
centre and its consequent reduction to H2 is a side-by-side process with CO2

coordination-reduction. However, as shown in Table 8.2, the reduction of CO2 in
water is not a simple process and the selectivity towards a target C1 or C1+
molecule containing CO2 in a reduced form is quite variable with the system
used, having the formation of either hydrogen or other C-species as a competing
process. Some of the competitive reactions are shown in Scheme 8.4.
Scheme 8.4 Competitive coordination to a metal centre and metal-catalysed reduction reactions
implying the proton and CO2. The formation of H2, CO and HCO2H are highlighted
A variety of metal systems have been used as catalysts in the electroreduction of
CO2, the most studied being Ni, Co, Pd and Ru. In the photochemical or photoelec-
trochemical processes, Ru and Re are mainly used. Table 8.2 presents a list of
metals, ligands, conditions and products of the electrocatalysed reaction of CO2.
A general route is the sequential “e + H+” transfer to CO2 coordinated to the
metal centre.
In electrocatalytic processes, electrons are provided by the electrode and protons
come from the solution. In photochemical processes, electrons are provided by a
semiconductor irradiated with the suitable radiation (UV or visible) and used for the
reduction of CO2, whereas the cogenerated “hole” is used for the oxidation of water
or a sacriﬁcial molecule. In photoelectrochemistry the two effects are coupled. A
key issue is the “overpotential” necessary for e-transfer. This means that the
reduction process does not occur at the “thermodynamic” potential but at more
negative values. The difference plays a key role in determining the cost and
exploitability of the process. The overpotential can be reduced by using
electrocatalysts which may present an easier adjustability of the energy of the

molecular orbitals so that the electrons can be transferred close to the thermody-
namic potential. Table 8.2 shows that the same reduction process can occur under
quite different (column 4) conditions, depending on the catalyst used.
The ﬁrst step in the reduction process is the binding of CO2 to the metal centre
((8.6) in Scheme 8.4). The reversible binding to a tetracoordinated (4N2  6)Co
(I) was ﬁrst electrochemically measured [35] to range around 7  104 M1 in dry
dimethylsulphoxide (dmso). Spectroscopic methods were also used, including
XANES (X-ray Adsorption Near Edge Structure) [36–42]. The bound-CO2 expe-
riences a large charge-shift from Co(I) as shown by the IR shift of the vasym(C¼O)
located at 1 710 cm1. Very interestingly, upon simple cooling of the solution a
further shift down to 1 544 cm1 is observed. XANES measurements have shown
that at room temperature (298 K) one full unit of charge is transferred from Co to
CO2 which results in a CO2
 state with Co in a +2 oxidation state. Conversely,
when the XANES measurements were carried out at low temperature (198 K), two
electron-transfer to CO2 is demonstrated so that the adduct results in a CoIII–CO2
2
state with CO2 bonded in a carbene-like mode CoIII¼CO2
2. Such a two-electron
transfer simpliﬁes the reduction of CO2 with respect to the one-electron transfer
which is energetically hindered (Table 8.1). Interestingly, it has been shown via
FTIR study [36–42] that the CO2
 species bound to Co is stabilized by interactions
between the O atoms and the amine hydrogens of the 4N2  6 ligand, as represented
in Fig. 8.7. Moreover, when co-ordinating solvents are used, a solvent molecule
(such as CH3CN) can occupy the sixth coordination position on Co, which results in
different properties as shown by the changes in the UV–vis spectrum [36].
DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p) set basis and CPCM for solvent effect)
have been used [2] to investigate the Co ! CO2 e-transfer in both (4N2  6)
CoI(CO2) and its solvated (CH3CN) form (Fig. 8.8).
The CoL–CO2 system above has been largely investigated [36, 38, 39, 43] for
the determination of the CO2-binding constants and rate constants found to depend
largely on the ligand used and on the solvent which may effectively solvate CO2
[37]. The binding-constants have been found to vary in the interval <1 to 106 M1,
although the rate constants range around 106 to 108 M1 s1. A correlation has been
found between the two values. These studies have been coupled with the determi-
nation of the E1/2 shown to vary in the interval 0.1 to 1.4 V (vs SHE).
All such complexes show a limited stability as they convert CO2 into CO (bound
or free).
The same complexes can also coordinate “H” (transferred as a hydrogen atom or
a proton [39, 44, 45]) as shown in (8.5). Interestingly, no insertion of CO2 into the
Co–H bond was observed although the Co–H system showed quite high pKa of the
order of 11–14.
Extended studies have also been carried out on Ni systems: Ni(NH3)4F2 [2, 46]
and Ni–N–macrocyclic ligand [47–50] complexes have been studied and modelled.
The ligands and oxidation state of Ni play a key role in the stabilization of Ni–CO2
adducts. The E1/2 value for Ni(II)-complexes with a number of the ligands shown in
Fig. 8.3 varies over the range 0.2 to 1.20 V (vs SHE), depending on the ligand
and the solvent used.

One- and Multi-electron Pathways for the Reduction of. . .
Using cyclam-related ligands characterized by various conformational conﬁgu-
rations (Fig. 8.9), it was demonstrated that the ligand RSRS in Fig. 8.9 favours the
binding of CO2 as the four hydrogens on the same side interact with O atoms of the
heterocumulene, reinforcing the bonding to Ni. The mode of bonding Ni–CO2 is
shown to be quite different from that encountered in Co–CO2 adducts because of
the nature of the orbitals involved. In the case of Ni, a doubly occupied molecular
orbital shares its electrons with the C atom of CO2 and the electron in a singly
occupied orbital also contributes to the bonding.
The adducts of CO2 with Co(I) and Ni(I) complexes show different properties
and binding free energies [51].

Competitive Coordination of CO2 and H+ to a Catalytic Centre and Their Reduction
325
All the parameters discussed above inﬂuence the catalytic activity of the metal
systems in electrochemical reactions. In particular, the cyclam-related Ni com-
plexes show an interesting selectivity towards CO2 reduction to CO, also repressing
the proton reduction in acidic water solutions. This distinctive behaviour with
respect to Co has been ascribed to the different pKa of the “LnNiH” systems with
respect to the analogous Co complexes. For example, the pKa of (cyclam)NiH2+ is
<2, making the interaction of “cyclamNi+” with CO2 much easier than with H+ in a
water solution saturated with CO2 in moderately acidic conditions (the addition of
H+ to “cyclamNi+” only occurs at very low pH).

Sequential “One-Electron Plus One-Proton” Pathways

The sequential transfer of “one electron plus one proton” mentioned above has been
proposed to operate in several catalytic pathways. The reaction mechanism of CO2
reduction has been investigated using several transition metal complexes as cata-
lysts (see, for example, [2, 14, 15, 24]). For some of them a reaction mechanism has

Early studies carried out by the J.-M. Lehn group [13] with Re(2N2  1)(CO)2Cl
have clearly demonstrated the competition proton-CO2 towards electrons. The
reduction in anhydrous solvents selectively (>98 %, TOF 21.4 h1, 1.49 V vs
SCE) produces CO, whereas a growing amount of added water produces increasing
amounts of H2. Such behaviour is not a negative fact as one may decide to produce
Syngas by electroreduction of CO2 in water, supposing that robust electrocatalysts
with high TOF and TON are developed. In 1987, Tanaka et al. [14] proposed the
catalytic cycle in Scheme 8.5 for the Ru-catalysed reduction of CO2 to CO, H2 and
HCO2
 at 1.40 V (SCE).
The protonation of “RuCO2H” to afford “RuC(O)OH2” causes water release and
the formation of CO. The oxidation state of Ru shuttles between +2 and 0. The 2e
transfer to Ru(II) produces the Ru(0) which is responsible for CO2 coordination
followed by a double protonation. In such a mechanism two electrons are trans-
ferred to Ru in one step and two protons are then added to CO2

under slightly acidic conditions (pH ¼ 6) with increase of the oxidation state of the
metal back to +2. Under more basic conditions, formate is obtained instead of
CO. Interestingly, changing Rh for Ru (E1, Table 8.2) with the same ligand
produces formate more than CO, also with average TOF and selectivity.
Other transition metal complexes (Co, Fe, Ni, Pd) with variously decorated
phosphane ligands have been used, showing different behaviours and catalytic
activities depending on the ligand (Fig. 8.4), the metal, and the conditions (solvent
and water presence). Pd-systems have been by far the most studied by DuBois and
coworkers [15–17]. The authors have shown that on using the dicationic complex
bearing 3P  1 (Fig. 8.4) and a tertiary phosphane as ligands to Pd (namely,
[(3P  1)(PR3)Pd(BF4)2]), the latter is ﬁrst converted into the active form through
the substitution of the phosphane with a solvent molecule (CH3CN). Such form is
able to promote two-(1-e + H+) consecutive transfers as shown in Scheme 8.6.
The Pd oxidation number is reduced from +2 to +1 by accepting a single
electron. The Pd(I) is the active form which picks-up CO2. Further protonation
and electron transfer form the dihydroxocarbene which eliminates water to afford
the dicationic labile-carbonyl complex, which eliminates CO under solvent
co-ordination. In an attempt to improve the catalytic properties (TOF and TON)
the polydentate P-ligand has been modiﬁed in many different ways by changing the
central P-donor atom as shown in Fig. 8.4 without any apparent gain in efﬁciency.
A different mechanism always based on a double consecutive (e + H+) transfer
has been proposed by the same authors (Scheme 8.7), in which the formation of the
“Pd-C(CO)OH2” intermediate more than the hydroxyl-carbene is postulated.

Very recently [54] a 2e reduction of N-heterocyclic carbene-carbonyl Mn(I) to
Mn(I) has been reported which occurs at the same potential (1.35 V vs SCE)
instead of two consecutive potentials separated by a few hundred mV as shown for
analogous MnBr(CO)x(2N  1). Such Mn complexes catalyse very selectively the
CO2 to CO reduction with a faradaic efﬁciency of 34.6 %.
All the above catalytic systems afford mainly CO, an interesting molecule as it
may release energy in combustion with air, but more useful C1 or C1+ molecules
can also be produced.
Scheme 8.8 shows the multiple “e + H+” transfer to afford methanol. Such a
sequence is very similar to the enzymatic reduction of CO2 to methanol which is
discussed in Chap. 9.
Cluster complexes consisting of di- and tri- homo- or hetero-nuclear species
have also been used (Scheme 8.9), the latter with the aim of taking advantage of the
possible co-operative effect of two different metal centres each able to perform a
different activity.

Ni2 and Ni3 clusters (Entries 14 and 15 in Table 8.2) are able to reduce CO2 at
various potentials (0.85 to 1.18 V SCE) affording mainly CO. The kinetics [56]
depends on the solvent used (which solvates the metal) and the kCO2 range from 0.1
to 1.6 M1 s1, with the maximum for CH3CN as ancillary ligand in a Ni3 cluster.
The
kCO2
trend
in
the

of

cyanides
[56]
was:
CH3CN¼C6H11CN > C6H5CH2CN > CO > (t-C4H9)CN, demonstrating that both
electronic and steric hindrance factors may play a role in the kinetics.
The metal-catalysed [57] reduction is favoured with respect to the participation
of the cyanide in the reduction of CO2 and shows two peculiar features: the nature
of the ancillary ligand (various cyanides as reported above or CO) does not greatly
affect the E1/2 (which varies in the restricted range 1.08 to 1.18 V SCE)
although it affects the kCO2, as mentioned above.
The Cu2(I) systems [22] stabilized by ligands bearing P- and N- as donor atoms
(Scheme 8.9, middle) reduce CO2 to CO and the CV shows two consecutive e-
transfers at 1.35 and 1.53 V (vs SCE). As reported in Table 8.2, carbonates are
also formed, inferring a mechanism such as that shown in Scheme 8.3.
The use of pyridine as an organic catalyst [26, 27, 58] has been proposed by
Bocarsly and coworkers. The interesting aspect of such electrocatalysts is that they
can promote several “1e + H+” transfer steps, affording several reduced species of
CO2, such as HCO2H, CH2O and CH3OH, but also C2 and C3 species. Quite
recently, the authors have critically reviewed [59] the proposed mechanisms and
report the possible role of H-bonded pyridinium-to-pyridine dimers in the
electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (Scheme 8.10).
A possible role is also attributed to pyridine-N-carboxylic acid (Scheme 8.11)
for the generation of the •CO2H moiety which is then further reduced to other C1
species. Scheme 8.12 provides a mechanism for the formation of several C1
species.
This chemistry is relevant to biochemical systems discussed in Chap. 9.

Photochemical and Photoelectrochemical Reduction
of CO2
The use of solar energy and other perennial primary sources of energy (wind,
geothermal, hydro) for the reduction of CO2 has great relevance to the conversion
of large volumes of CO2 to valuable chemicals and fuels. All such sources can be
used in a indirect way, as they can generate electricity which can be used either, as
indicated above, for the reduction of CO2 in water or for the electrolysis of water to
afford hydrogen that can be used for CO2 reduction as reported in Chap. 7. In the
very short term the use of excess electric energy (off-peak electricity), especially if
produced from perennial sources, is a suitable strategy; in the medium term the use
of PV can results in a viable approach [60]. Today, the cost of PV is too high
(Table 8.4) for practical application.
This implies that the price of chemicals produced by using the PV-generated H2
is much higher than that of products obtained using H2 produced by reforming
methane.

Anyway, if one considers the perspective increase of the efﬁciency of PV (from
20 % to 40 %) and the reduced cost of PV materials, one can foresee that the price of
PV-generated H2 decreases and gets close to that of H2 by reforming. So, in the
short term, H2 generated via PV or wind- or geothermal- or hydro-electricity may
compete with H2 produced by methane reforming.
The use of solar energy assumes a particular role as solar radiation can be used
directly in photochemical (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes. The
former use either soluble (homogeneous) or insoluble (heterogeneous) compounds
which may capture solar radiation which generates excitons (e + hole) used for the
direct reduction of CO2 and oxidation of the donor (water or sacriﬁcial reagents)
whereas in PEC processes, electrons generated in photoreactions are used in
conjunction with an electrode.
In a homogeneous photochemical process (Scheme 8.13) solar radiation is
captured by a soluble sensitizer (P) in the presence of a donor (D) whereas a solid
photomaterial is used in heterogeneous photochemical processes (Scheme 8.14).
The photosensitizer is excited to P* with production of an exciton (e + hole). The
hole oxidises the donor (water or a sacriﬁcial reagent) as the negative charge is
transferred to a metal centre (Mred) where the CO2 is reduced to C1 or C1+ species
with reoxidation of the metal centre.

Several sensitizers have been used, such as metal complexes (Ru, Re) with the

materials
(http://www2.lbl.gov/mfea/assets/docs/posters/14_Artiﬁcial_Photosyn
thesis) can also be used as heterogeneous photocatalysts.
Another approach to the use of solar energy is the hybrid system [62–66] formed
by enzymes for the selective reduction of CO2 and solar energy and photomaterials
for the regeneration of cofactors (Scheme 8.15). This topic is discussed in Chap. 9.

is a parameter somewhat similar to the “faradaic efﬁciency” deﬁned in Table 8.2.
Among homogeneous photocatalysts, it is worth citing metal complexes with
ligands having an extended system of conjugated double-bonds able to absorb solar
light: phthalocyanines [68], corroles [12], corrins [69] or similar macrocyclic
systems are typical ligands. The metal centres are Co or Fe or other metals. The
negative point is that a low selectivity is observed with a large production of
hydrogen, and this is also true for those systems, which under electrochemical
conditions are quite effective for CO2 reduction to C1 species (Scheme 8.16).

In early studies in the 1980s [56, 70, 71], Ru(2N  1)3
n+ was used as an efﬁcient
photosensitizer and organic molecules as e-donors. The drawback was that the
sacriﬁcial reagents were more expensive than the products formed from CO2,
making such systems non-viable economically. An interesting case in which a
unique complex acts as sensitizer and catalyst is represented by Re(2N  1)
(CO)3X (X ¼ Cl, Br) [70, 72] which is able to produce CO selectively.
Re complexes bearing phosphite ligands are the ones which show the best
performance as photosensitizers for what concerns the quantum efﬁciency (0.38–
0.59) [23, 73] using Re(2N  1)(CO)3(CH3CN) as catalyst and N(CH2CH2OH)3 as
sacriﬁcial reagent. The mechanism is shown in Scheme 8.17.
The use of solid photomaterials has been investigated since the 1980s using
semiconductors as light absorbers and catalysts in several solvent media. The key
issue in this case is that the band gap of the semiconductor used as photomaterials
must match the potential of CO2 reduction. Figure 8.10 shows the band gap
expressed in V of several semiconductors compared with the reduction potential
of CO2 in one- and multi-electron transfer processes.
Although quite a few semiconductors are good photomaterials for CO2
multielectron reduction under proton transfer regime, the one-electron transfer is
not easily feasible. Moreover, in this case too, as in the electrochemical reduction of
CO2, kinetic issues cause an overvoltage increase which makes more energy
required for the reduction processes.
Figure 8.10 shows that the most popular photomaterial (TiO2) is not the best
suited for such reduction processes. Moreover, TiO2 absorbs mainly UV radiation,
although the main interest is to use the visible part of the solar spectrum.

injection to the conduction band from the excited photosensitizer; (e) dye-photosensitization

This problem can be solved by modifying the TiO2 properties by depositing on
its surface materials which can inﬂuence the band gap by shifting it more towards
the visible region. This is possible in several modes as shown in Scheme 8.18.
p-Si has received attention for the reduction of CO2 under quasi-neutral condi-
tions (pH ¼ 6–7). Another approach to photochemically induced CO2 conversion is
its formal 1e reduction to afford C–C bond formation in carboxylates – see (8.15).

In this photochemistry, the formation of the radical anion CO2
. has been demon-
strated to be the key issue. The photomaterial used (ZnS) has the correct band gap,
although Ru enhances the light harvesting capacity and drives the carboxylation
reaction under sunlight irradiation.
The use of a semiconductors level surface as a photocathode is an interesting
approach to the use of light. Coupling of semiconductors with metal catalysts which
may drive the electron transfer and the selectivity of the reaction is an interesting
option. The integration of the two properties in a PEC system should not change the
FE (see Table 8.2) and selectivity towards products, eventually showing only a
positive photovoltage shift of the onset voltage. Therefore, the interaction with
surfaces and metal centres are analogous to those discussed in the previous chapters
and the reaction mechanisms remain those discussed above. An open problem in
some cases is whether the multielectron reduction occurs at the electrode surface or
in solution, either in proximity to the electrode or in the bulk. Another point of
discussion is whether there exists any univocal correlation between the electronic
structure of the metal electrode and the formed products. Some authors have
suggested that metals with incomplete d-orbitals may lead to an insurgence of
π-bonding and thus favour the formation of CO over HCO2
, whereas d10 or
Mg-like metal systems may favour the formation of oxalates and formates [30,
74]. An interesting case is represented by Cu, which has long been known [30] to be
able to produce C2 and C3 species. The preliminary formation of CO has been
postulated as the necessary step for C1+ formation.
PEC based on the semiconductor–molecular catalysts junction is an attractive
case, as the molecular catalyst may better drive the sequential “e + H+ transfer”
than the ﬂat electrode surface. Several pairings of semiconductor–metal complex
are reported in the literature, including p-Si [75, 76], p-GaAs [77], p-InP [78] and
p-GaP [79] coupled to several Co-, Ni- or Re-macrocyclic N-ligands or to other
metal couples such as V(III)–V(II) [80] or TiO2 [81]. In general, the reduction
product of CO2 is CO. An interesting case is represented by the couple p-GaP:
pyridinium ion (organic catalyst) [82], which is able to convert CO2 into CH3OH
with a remarkable 63–100 % faradaic efﬁciency at pH ¼ 5.2, and a conversion
efﬁciency of 11 % at 365 nm. The energy conversion efﬁciency has for a long time
[83] been known to be related to the so-called “Fermi level pinning” [84] in
semiconductors–liquid junctions, which makes possible the photoreduction of
species with redox potential more negative than the conduction band edge of

p-type semiconductors, such as those mentioned above. Such biphasic solid–liquid
systems are characterized by three critical steps, namely (1) exciton generation and
charge separation in semiconductors, (2) e-transfer from the solid to the metal
system in the liquid phase and (3) CO2 reduction on the metal centre. Step (1) can be
affected by charge recombination which results in the conversion of light into
thermal energy. Step (2), the charge transfer, is affected by several parameters
such as the diffusion layer and properties of the semiconductor. Step (3) has already
been discussed. The relation of photocurrent density to photon ﬂux, diffusion and
other factors has been theoretically investigated [85] and a correlation to several
parameters found [86].
An alternative to the solid–liquid junction is represented by anchoring the
catalyst on the level semiconductor surface. This practice is largely used in catalysis
in the so-called heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts, and is useful for their
easy recovery. The heterogenization can be carried out in several ways by deposi-
tion, inglobation and tethering of metal systems. The ﬁrst two techniques may
somehow affect the structural features of the metal centre, whereas the latter does
not inﬂuence the geometry of the catalytic centre, which remains practically the
same as in the homogeneous catalyst. In the decoration of semiconductors, the
nature of the “tether” may play a key role in several ways. The use of organic
polymers (polyaniline [87]) has been known for a long time. Alternative routes,
such as coordination to the catalytic metal centre of unsaturated ligands, which may
undergo polymerization (polyvinyl-M systems [78]) have also been attempted.
An attempt has been made to use such an approach for the conversion of solar
light [88, 89] using enzymes supported on electrodes [90, 91]. The use of hybrid
systems in which enzymes selectively drive the reduction and a photocatalyst
regenerates the cofactor has been demonstrated to be a feasible approach [62, 64]
and needs further improvement for exploitation. This area deserves attention and
the growing interest in such research is fully justiﬁed by its potential of converting
large volumes of CO2 into bulk or specialty chemicals [67] by using solar energy
and mimicking natural processes [52].

The interesting aspect of PEC is that it is possible to use such technology with a
single dual-face electrode (Scheme 8.19) in a compact two-compartment single cell
which allows simple product separation.

Such a device needs a well-performing, fast and robust proton-exchange mem-
brane. In principle, a cell designed for water splitting [92] under solar irradiation
may also serve for CO2-water co-processing. Therefore, work done on solar-driven
water splitting [76] can be transferred to CO2 conversion into chemicals/fuels under
solar irradiation.
The interesting aspect is that, as discussed above, different electrocatalysts may
afford different CO2-reduction products. Therefore, such technology may result in a
ﬂexible tool for the production of selected chemicals or fuels from CO2 and water,
implementing a “CO2 economy”. Adaptation of the combinatorial approach to
testing electrocatalysts [93] has been proposed as a route to shortening the time-
to-market for such devices. Miniaturization [94] or development of new concept
photobioreactors [95] can be a solution to the space issue, which is a predominant
factor in the large scale development of CO2 conversion. Coupling EC–PC–PEC
with thermal processes and with enhanced biotechnological conversion of CO2 [96]
may shorten the time to exploitation of carbon-recycling, mimicking natural pho-
tosynthesis [97].

Enzymatic Conversion of CO2
(Carboxylation Reactions and Reduction
to Energy-Rich C1 Molecules)
Abstract This chapter deals with the enzymatic conversion of CO2. It covers the
two aspects of the ﬁxation of the entire CO2 molecule into substrates (carboxyla-
tion) and the reduction of CO2 to other C1 (or C2) energy-richer molecules. The
known mechanisms are discussed and barriers to exploitation at the industrial level
highlighted.
9.1
Introduction
Enzyme-catalyzed processes have been used for centuries to make wine, beer,
bread, and cheese. In general, enzymatic processes are faster, cleaner, and easier
to operate with respect to microbial processes, which need very strict culturing
conditions and require careful separation and puriﬁcation steps to obtain the
products [1].
The efﬁcient utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has attracted considerable
attention from fundamental research to industrial application in recent years. The
efﬁcient conversion of (renewable) CO2 using enzymes could complement thermal,
electrochemical, photochemical and photoelectrochemical processes for effective
utilization of CO2, eventually reducing the greenhouse gas effect while producing
useful
chemicals
or
fuels.
Heterogeneous
catalysis,
electrocatalysis,
and
photocatalysis are, at present, the three predominant technologies for converting
CO2 into useful chemicals, such as methanol, formic acid, acrylic acid, and
carbonates, among others [2–5]. However, such methods need high temperature
and pressure or additional electric or luminous energy, with some selectivity and
yield issues. In comparison, the enzymatic approach to convert CO2 has several
advantages, such as high yields and selectivity under mild reaction conditions,
without any signiﬁcant impact on the environment [6, 7].

CO2 Fixation in Biosynthesis
Autotrophic organisms are able to synthesize complex organic molecules by assim-
ilation of CO2 via reduction. Depending on the type of redox equivalents, two
different main pathways exist, which are largely divided into organisms living in
the dark or in the light (Scheme 9.1):
1. Chemoautotrophic organisms, such as bacteria or Archea living in the dark and
in hostile environments such as the deep sea, which obtain their energy through
the oxidation of inorganics such as H2S, elemental sulfur, metal ions (Fe2+, Mn2+),
ammonia, or nitrite;
2. Photoautotrophic organisms, such as plants or algae, protists, and cyano bacteria,
which use water as an electron source and light as an energy source.
Scheme 9.1 CO2 ﬁxation in biosynthesis
It is estimated that more than 98 % of the CO2 that enters the biological carbon
cycle (~200 GtC/y) is ﬁxed by carboxylases, which makes them crucial players in
controlling atmospheric CO2 concentrations [8, 9]. Biological CO2 ﬁxation can
occur following four different pathways [10, 11]:
1. The Calvin–Benson–Bassham-cycle [12, 13].
2. The reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA; Arnon–Buchanan) cycle [14].
3. The reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway [15–17].

4. Acyl-CoA carboxylase pathways: 3-hydroxypropionate/malonyl-CoA cycle
[18, 19], 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle [20], dicarboxylate/
4-hydroxybutyrate pathway [21], and the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway [22].
9.2.1
Calvin–Benson–Bassham-Cycle
Atmospheric CO2 may be ﬁxed through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham-cycle [13,
23–25]. The key carboxylating enzyme, D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/
oxygenase (RubisCO) [26], binds CO2 onto a pentose derivative, ribulose-1,5-
bisphosphate. It has been estimated that about 4  1013 g (40 Mt) of RubisCO
exists in the biosphere, which would correspond to an intangible 5 kg of RubisCO
per person on Earth [27].
Scheme 9.2 illustrates the mechanism for RubisCO (http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/

13%3A_Reactions_with_stabilized_carbanion_intermediates_I/Section_13.5%
3A_Carboxylation_and_decarboxylation_reactions). It consists of different steps. Mag-
nesium ions play a key charge-stabilizing role throughout the reaction. During the ﬁrst
step, hydrogen is transferred from the alpha carbon to the keto group of ribulose and the
enolic form is deprotonated. In Step 2 an intramolecular proton transfer occurs to afford
an enolate at carbon 3, making C2 nucleophilic for an aldol-like attack on CO2 (Step 3).
However, carbon dioxide is incorporated into the organic substrate and con-
verted into a carboxylate group in the “six-carbon sugar” derivative. The hydrolysis
of the carboxylate (Step 4) affords two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, which
are incorporated into the ‘gluconeogenesis’ pathway of glucose synthesis.

9.2.2
Reductive TCA (Arnon–Buchanan) Cycle
The reductive TCA cycle uses CO2 for producing acetyl-CoA [28, 29]. Two CO2
units are converted in each cycle into acetyl-CoA using one ATP and four NAD(P)
H units. The full cycle was ﬁrst reported to be found in a green sulfur photosynthetic
bacterium (Chlorobium limicola) and was later also found to operate in Aquiﬁcales,
Archeal Crenarcheota, and various types of proteobacteria.
The reductive citric acid cycle is generally considered to be the most energy-
efﬁcient CO2 ﬁxation pathway (0.6 mol ATP/mol CO2 for pyruvate) [20, 30,
31]. This is reﬂected by the activity of the pathway’s key carboxylases, isocitrate
dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and pyruvate: ferre-
doxin oxidoreductase. All three enzymes couple their carboxylation reaction to a
subsequent reduction step. Whereas isocitrate dehydrogenase is an NAD(P)H-
dependent enzyme, the latter two enzymes use ferredoxin as a reductant
(Scheme 9.3) [32–34].

In a ﬁrst step, succinyl-CoA is reductively carboxylated by 2-oxoglutarate
synthase to form 2-oxoglutarate at the expense of 2 equiv. of reduced ferredoxin.
Then, the oxoglutarate formed is again reductively carboxylated by isocitrate
dehydrogenase. In the latter reaction, the (de)carboxylation step is assumed to
proceed via the formation of an enolate moiety of an α-oxoglutarate, which is
formed through the assistance of an essential divalent Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion
(cf. RubisCO), leading to a highly unstable keto-tricarboxylic acid intermediate,
which is immediately reduced to yield stable isocitrate. Both the enzymes active in
the reductive TCA-cycle are highly specialized so it is supposed that they do not
accept man-made substrates which occur in the Calvin cycle.
9.2.3
Reductive Acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) Pathway
If we compare the reductive acetyl CoA pathway with the Calvin cycle and the
reductive TCA pathways, we see that it presents some differences: it is a linear
unidirectional pathway, through which two molecules of CO2 are reductively

coupled to afford acetyl-CoA, and it proceeds through some rarely occurring
organometallic enzyme–substrate intermediates, such as methyl-Co- and Ni-
carbonyl-species [35]. This pathway contains some of the most sophisticated
enzymatic catalysis known to date (Scheme 9.4) and it is not surprising that some
of its components are extremely oxygen-sensitive.

Overall, it represents the most important method by which anaerobic organisms,
such as acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic Archaea, sequester carbon for
biomass production and energy for living [36, 37].
9.2.4
Acyl-CoA Carboxylation Pathways
In contrast to the above-mentioned pathways for CO2-ﬁxation, which have
been
known
for
decades,
several
autotrophic
CO2-assimilation
pathways
occurring in anaerobic autotrophs have been elucidated only recently. If the
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway can be listed as the ‘ﬁfth’ path-
way of CO2-assimilation [11], it has been considered together with the other acyl-
CoA carboxylation pathways because all the carboxylation steps show a common
feature: they all take place on a (CoA-activated) carboxylic acid substrate.
In the 3-hydroxypropionate/malyl-CoA cycle and the 3-hydroxypropionate/
4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, one molecule of CO2 is bound onto acetyl-CoA via
an ATP-dependent step catalyzed by acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. After sequential
reduction of the terminal carboxylate group, propionyl-CoA is carboxylated in
the same way, yielding methylmalonyl-CoA (Scheme 9.5).

For this reason (similar approach of conversion), it was assumed that
both enzymes are identical [38]. In both cases a C2-unit is produced: the
acetyl-CoA in the 3-hydroxypropionate/malyl-CoA cycle and the glyoxylate in
the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway.
A variant of the above-mentioned carboxylation was found in the dicarboxylate/
4-hydroxybutyrate pathway [39] (Scheme 9.6) where the acetyl-CoA is reductively
carboxylated by pyruvate synthase at the expense of 2 equiv. of ferredoxin to afford
pyruvate which is then phosphorylated.

Interesting is the carboxylation of crotonyl-CoA to afford ethylmalonyl-CoA.
The mechanism suggests that the β-carbon of crotonyl-CoA accepts a hydride

ethylmalonyl-CoA (Scheme 9.7).

Carboxylation Reactions
Carboxylation reactions occur widely in nature [40, 41] by the direct use of
carbon dioxide or hydrogen carbonate and are mediated by enzymes, which
may or may not have a metal as an active center. Such direct carboxylation
reactions have found very few applications for synthetic purposes at industrial
level [42–46]. An example of a carboxylation reaction is the assimilation of carbon
into organic compounds which is the result of a complex series of enzymatically
regulated chemical reactions.
9.3.1
Bio-Carboxylation of Aromatic and Hetero-Aromatic
Compounds
Although the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction (9.1), known for more than a century, is used
industrially for the synthesis of 2-OH-benzoic acid (2) and 4-OH-benzoic acid (3),
the selectivity and yield of which are still not completely mastered, and the
production of either pure isomer not easily achieved. For these reasons, puriﬁcation
processes are required after the synthesis, which consume energy and produce
waste.

Aresta et al. [47] have found, during their studies on the degradation of phenol
by Thauera aromatica under anaerobic conditions [48], that the pathway for phenol
metabolism follows the route, quite common in nature, of ‘increasing the complex-
ity of the molecule for its easier degradation’ [49, 50]. As depicted in Scheme 9.8,
phenol is ﬁrst phosphorylated (7), then carboxylated to 4-OH-benzoic acid (8),
which is converted into the active form 4-OH-benzoyl-CoA (9), subsequently
dehydroxylated to benzoyl-CoA (10), the active form of benzoic acid. The latter
is then eventually converted into CO2 and H2O. 4-OH-benzoic acid is an interesting
monomer for the production of polymers used in optics. It was therefore interesting
to check whether it was possible to develop a biotechnological route to its produc-
tion. Obviously, the entire bacteria were not suited for its production, as they would
use it for their metabolism and growth. Therefore, the carboxylation enzymes were
isolated and used. The bacterial cells were thus broken and the crude extract,
obtained after ultracentrifugation, was partially puriﬁed by using membranes with
a given molecular weight cut-off “MWCO” [6, 47]. The extracted-semipuriﬁed
enzymes were used for the carboxylation of phenol in vitro. This was the ﬁrst
application of a phenol carboxylase enzyme for the functionalization of organic
substrates. The process is clean and good results are obtained, with a turnover
number of approximately 16,000.

Attempts to enhance the low stability by supporting the enzyme on low melting
agar has been carried out successfully [51]. Supercritical carbon dioxide was also
used as solvent/reagent for semi-puriﬁed phenylphosphate carboxylase extracted
from T. aromatica [52].
Phenylphosphate carboxylase can also carboxylate catechol and o-cresol as it
can phenol [53] to yield 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoate
respectively. Similarly, Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus, which catalyzes the
354

decarboxylation of several benzoic acids, is also able to catalyze the reverse
(carboxylation) reaction of phenol or catechol in the presence of hydrogencarbonate
or CO2 to yield 4-OH or 3,4-OH benzoic acids, respectively [54–56].
Acids such as pyruvic acid can be produced from acetaldehyde and carbon
dioxide using the reverse reaction of pyruvate decarboxylase as shown in
Scheme 9.9 [57].
The reaction, carried out in solventless conditions and using Brewer’s yeast
pyruvate decarboxylase at 500 mM NaHCO3–Na2CO3 buffer and pH 11, gives a
yield of 81 % in pyruvic acid [57].
L-Lactic acid may be produced from carbon dioxide and ethanol by using a
multienzyme reaction system, with a designed internal cofactor regeneration loop [1].

The process shown in Scheme 9.10 consists of three phases:
1. Synthesis of pyruvate from CO2 and acetaldehyde using pyruvate decarboxylase
(PyDC) as enzyme
2. Reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
3. Regeneration of the cofactor NADH needed for reduction of pyruvate, achieved
through the oxidation of ethanol catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)

[58], which was puriﬁed from B. megaterium PYR2910. The reverse reaction was
performed at 298 K in a tightly closed reaction vessel containing potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 5.5, necessary to counteract the pH increase by the HCO3

addition), ammonium acetate, pyrrole, dithiothreitol (useful to stabilize the
enzyme), enzyme, and KHCO3. The optimum temperature and pH for CO2 ﬁxation
were 318 K and pH 7.0, respectively.
A possible mechanism (Scheme 9.11) of action of pyrrole-2-carboxylase decar-
boxylase has been proposed [58, 59], that requires further improvement, where the
organic acid acts as “cofactor” and deprotonates the NH-moiety, causing a nucle-
ophilic attack of Cα at the electrophile CO2; then the intermediate regains aroma-
ticity after tautomerisation.

The enzyme was found in Arthrobacter nicotianae FI1612 and several molds. Its
activity was induced speciﬁcally by indole-3-carboxylate, but not by indole. The
indole-3-carboxylate decarboxylase of A. nicotianae FI1612 catalyzed the
nonoxidative decarboxylation of indole-3-carboxylate into indole, and efﬁciently
carboxylated indole and 2-methylindole by the reverse reaction.
Some phenolic acid decarboxylases [60, 62–65] which catalyze the con-
version of hydroxycinnamic acids into styrenes are also of interest. Considering
the structural data available to date, both enzymes work with different
mechanisms:
1. Benzoic acid decarboxylase (BADC) requires a metal active site such as Zn2+
[66].
2. Phenolic acid decarboxylase (PADC) is a metal-independent acid–base catalyst
[67–69].

Bio-Carboxylation of Epoxides
Some bacteria can degrade epoxides, converting them into β-keto acids.
For example, in Xanthobacter Py2, poly-β-hydroxyalkanoates are produced
[70, 71]. The epoxide degradation seems to be regulated by the presence or absence
of CO2, as reported in Scheme 9.13.

mechanism shown in Scheme 9.14 has been proposed where the epoxide is ﬁrst
carboxylated by the epoxide carboxylase, forming the acetoacetate as intermediate
which undergoes NADH-dependent reduction catalyzed by β-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase to obtain β-hydroxybutyrate.
9.4
Reduction Reactions
The reduction of CO2 in Nature occurs in several organisms, under anaerobic or
aerobic conditions. The methanation of organic substrates involves, among others,
enzymes which are able to reduce in a single step CO2 to CO [carbon monoxide
dehydrogenases (CODH)] or to formic acid [formate dehydrogenases (FateDH)].
CO2 can be reduced to the methyl group –CH3 through a tetrahydrofolate-THF-
mediated process. CO and –CH3 are coupled to give the acetyl moiety using an
Fe4S4–Ni enzyme and vitamin B12. Formate can be reduced to formaldehyde under
the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaldDH) enzyme, and formaldehyde can be
converted into methanol by the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme.
9.4.1
Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenases
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) enzymes catalyze the interconversion of
CO and CO2. These enzymes can be categorized into two classes:
1. Ni-CODH enzymes, found in anaerobic bacteria which have an [Ni4Fe5S]
cluster as the active site.
2. Mo-CODH enzymes, found in aerobic carboxydotrophic bacteria which have a
CuMo-pterin active site.
There is also the related class of Ni-CODH/ACS (acetyl CoA synthetase), where
the CODH enzyme is part of a larger protein in which CO2 reduction is coupled to
acetyl CoA synthesis.
Ni,Fe-containing CODHs play an important role in anaerobic bacteria and
archea by allowing them to grow with CO or CO2 as their sole carbon and/or
energy source. The structures of CODHs are homodimers with ~130 kDa
containing ﬁve metal clusters, called B, B0, C, C0, and D (Fig. 9.1) [72].
Each subunit contains the active site C-cluster and cubane-type [Fe4S4] B-cluster.
Another [Fe4S4] D-cluster connects two subunits forming a covalent homodimer.
The CODHs catalyze the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 at the active site
C-cluster, which is composed of [NiFe4S4OHx] (CO + H2O $ CO2 + 2e + 2H+).
In addition to the reversible oxidation of CO, CODHs are able to catalyze further
358

reactions, such as the oxidation of H2 and the reductions of protons, 2,4,6-
trinitrotoluene (TNT), and hydroxylamine, and the oxidation of n-butylisocyanide
(n-BIC). n-BIC is a slow-turnover substrate of CODHs, whose oxidation occurs at
the C-cluster.
The Mo-CODH metalloprotein is known to have three subunits – L, M, and
S. The molybdenum active site is found in the L subunit. The M subunit consists of
a 2-ﬂavoprotein, and the S subunit contains two [2Fe-2S] clusters [73].
There has been some controversy over the active site structure of the Mo-CODH.
Dobbek et al. [74] determined the crystal structure to 2.2 Å, which revealed an
active site where molybdenum is coordinated by two oxo ligands, a hydroxo group,
and one pyranopterin cofactor (Fig. 9.2a) [74].
Later, upon further investigation, the crystal structure was resolved to 1.1 Å,
which revealed different results. It was determined that the active site was heterobi-
metallic containing both molybdenum and copper (Fig. 9.2b).

acid through an oxidoreductive process (9.2) [75].

FDHs present in acetogens are known to take part in a carbon ﬁxation metabolic
pathway producing acetate (the Eastern branch of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway),
in which the ﬁrst step involves reduction of CO2 to formate [76]. Several FDHs are
known to catalyze CO2 reduction under appropriate conditions [77–81]. Those
enzymes from acetogenic and related anaerobes, such as Moorella thermoacetica
and Clostridium pasteurianum, are better than other FDHs as reduction catalysts
but also show similar catalytic efﬁciency toward formate oxidation.
The structure of Escherichia coli FDHH, as solved by multiple isomorphous
replacement (MIR) and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) methods,
consists of four αβ domains [82]. It has been prepared with MOLSCRIPT and
RASTER3D [83–85].
Formate dehydrogenase H from E. coli contains selenocysteine (SeCys), molyb-
denum, two molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) cofactors, and an Fe4S4
cluster at the active site.
9.4.3
Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase
FaldDH was isolated and puriﬁed in an overall yield of 12 % from cell-free extract of
Pseudomonas putida C-83 by chromatography on a column of DEAE-cellulose,
DEAE-Sephadex A-50, and hydroxyapatite. NAD and especially NADH stabilize
the enzyme during storage and against denaturation at high temperatures.
The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 150,000 by gel ﬁltration
method, and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the
enzyme was composed of two subunit monomers [86].
Kinetic analysis gave Km values of 67 μM for formaldehyde and 56 μM for
NAD+, and suggested that the reaction proceeds by a “ping-pong” mechanism. The
enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of formaldehyde accompanied by the stoichiomet-
ric reduction of NAD+, but no reverse reaction was observed. The crystal structure

Alcohol Dehydrogenases
Alcohol dehydrogenases are a group of dehydrogenase enzymes which occur in
many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes
or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ to
NADH). The ﬁrst-ever isolated alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was puriﬁed in
1937 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) [88]. Many aspects of the
catalytic mechanism for the horse liver ADH enzyme were investigated by Hugo
Theorell and coworkers [89]. ADH was also one of the ﬁrst oligomeric enzymes
that had its amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure determined [90,
91]. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, one of the most studied (along with the
yeast enzyme), is a symmetrical dimer. Each chain is about 40 kDa, contains two
Zn++ (orange), only one of which is catalytically active, and each binds a single
NAD+ (green) (Fig. 9.4)
9.4.5
Production of Acetic Acid
Anaerobic bacteria such as Moorella thermoacetica have the capacity to ﬁx carbon
dioxide with carbon monoxide and hydrogen for the production of ethanol, acetic
acid, and other useful chemicals.
Acetogenic bacteria ﬁx CO2 via the Wood–Ljungdahl (W–L) metabolic pathway
as shown in Scheme 9.15. The pathway comprises two branches, the methyl branch
and the carbonyl branch, by which CO2 and CO as carbon sources are converted
into acetic acid and ethanol. In the methyl branch, one CO2 molecule is converted,

via formate, to a methyl moiety aided by the cofactor tetrahydrofolate. Reduction of
carbon dioxide to the methyl group requires six electrons. In the carbonyl branch,
two electrons are utilized to reduce one CO2 molecule to CO, which reacts with the
methyl moiety to form acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by the acetyl-CoA
synthase enzyme.

CO can also be used directly to form acetyl-CoA, rather than being produced
from CO2 reduction. Acetic acid, ethanol, and cell mass are the main products
produced from the intermediate acetyl-CoA [15].
9.4.6
Reduction of CO2 to Carbon Monoxide or Formate
Classes of enzymes such as CODHs and FDHs are able to catalyze the reversible
reduction of CO2 to CO or HCOO, respectively. There are two types of CODHs:
the ﬁrst is an O2-sensitive enzyme from obligate anaerobes such as Moorella
thermoacetica, Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, Methanosarcina barkerii
characterized by [Fe4S4Ni] active sites and the second are air stable [MoSCu]-
containing enzymes (Oligotropha carboxidovorans). Because of their different
active sites (different metals in particular) it is expected a different mode of actions.
In some prokaryotes the FDHs are complex enzymes which contain molybde-
num or tungsten cofactors to transfer the electrons from formate oxidation to an
independent active site, to reduce quinone, protons, or NAD(P) [82, 92]. These
enzymes are suitable for adsorption onto an electrode, so that the electrode accepts
the electrons from formate oxidation, and it may also donate electrons and drive

CO2 reduction. Therefore, they are potential electrocatalysts for the reduction of
CO2 (see Scheme 9.16). Two electrons are transferred from the electrode to the
active site (buried inside the insulating protein interior) by the iron–sulfur clusters,
to reduce CO2 to formate, forming a C–H bond. Conversely, when formate is
oxidized, the two electrons are transferred from the active site to the electrode.

Tungstoenzymes catalyze low-potential reactions [93] so tungsten-containing
FDHs, in which the tungsten is coordinated by two pyranopterin guanosine dinu-
cleotide cofactors and a selenocysteine [92], are those most associated with CO2
reduction.

of
the
tungsten-containing
FDHs,

FDH1,

by
Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, an anaerobic bacterium, oxidizes propionate to
acetate, CO2, and six reducing equivalents [94]. The reducing equivalents are
used to reduce protons to hydrogen or to reduce CO2 to formate.
The NADH-independent FDH enzymes from S. fumaroxidans are highly unsta-
ble and inactive in the presence of O2, limiting their practical application. Con-
versely, the NADH-dependent FDH from Candida boidinii (CbsFDH) was
sufﬁciently stable for commercial use and has been used to enzymatically regener-
ate NADH. CbsFDH requires NADH, protons, and electrons to convert CO2 into
formate, which can be supplied by the electrochemical system of the Cu electrode

Bioconversion of Carbon Dioxide into Methanol
In an attempt to mimic Nature, a biotechnological approach to the conversion of
CO2 into methanol has been investigated based on the use of enzymes. In fact, it has
been shown that the enzymes FateDH, FaldDH, and ADH are able to reduce CO2 in
water at room temperature [7]. A minimum of 3 mol of NADH are consumed per
mol of CH3OH produced (Scheme 9.18).

This approach, even if quite appealing, is not economically and energetically
affordable unless NAD+ formed upon oxidation of NADH is efﬁciently recycled,
increasing thereby the ratio CH3OH/NADH to limits that can be acceptable for a
biotechnological production of methanol.

Enzymatic Conversion of CO2 (Carboxylation. . .
More robust enzymes have been obtained [95] by encapsulation. TEOS is better
used with Ca-alginate as agent for producing a Ca-silicate cage, as it avoids any
interference with the production of methanol in the case of non-complete hydrolysis
of TMOS [97, 98]. Co-encapsulated enzymes work better than singly encapsulated
ones [99].
In order to increase the ratio CH3OH/NADH, the regeneration of NAD+ into
NADH should be performed through a reduction reaction of NAD+ to NADH.
Different ways can be considered: (1) chemicals that act as reducing agents;
(2) metal systems that may use dihydrogen for the reduction under thermal or
irradiated conditions; (3) semiconductors, water, and light as sources of energy
hydrogen for the reduction; (4) electrocatalysts that may reduce NAD+ under
electrochemical conditions.
Among the chemicals, hydrazine and sodium dithionite-SDT [100, 101] have
been used. The latter has been slowly added up to a stoichiometric amount – see
(9.3) – to NAD+ after all NADH is oxidized to NAD+, producing 5 mol of methanol
per mol of NADH. Addition of excess of SDT causes a rapid deactivation of the
enzymes.

In order to avoid such detrimental contact, the oxidation of NADH and the
reduction of NAD+ have been carried out in separate boxes to obtain a ratio of
CH3OH/NADH up to >35 [102].
Galarneau et al. [103] compared different regeneration systems: phosphite
dehydrogenase (PTDH), one of the most efﬁcient enzymatic recycling systems
reported so far (together with formate dehydrogenase but already used here in the
opposite direction) which converts phosphite into phosphate, a chemical used to
buffer the solution, and glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH), which transforms glyc-
erol into dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and a natural photosystem extracted from
spinach leaves (chloroplasts). It has been shown that, under the catalytic conditions
needed for the CO2 reduction into methanol (pH 6.5, 310 K), PTDH is much more
active than GlyDH.
For the chloroplast photosystem, only 0.25 mM NADH was obtained in 30 min,
which is below the NADH regenerating activity of PTDH.
By using PTDH plus phosphite together with the polyenzymatic system encap-
sulated in silica nanocapsules (internal diameter 30 nm) nanostructured by phos-
pholipids (NPS), an activity 55 times higher than the free enzymes in solution was
observed.
A different biological system could be the acetogenic bacteria microbes [104]
used as biocatalysts for the electrochemical reductive conversion of CO2 with
efﬁciency of 80–100 % in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). The direct bacterial
use for electrochemical CO2 conversion could solve the problem related to the
enzyme puriﬁcation steps and widens the choice of catalysts to include the naturally
developed and optimized microorganisms.

Also interesting is the hybrid bioinspired systems used for the enzymatic reduc-
tion of CO2 to CH3OH in water [105] that combines two processes: the enzymatic
reduction of CO2 to CH3OH promoted by the reduced form of coenzyme NADH
and the in situ photocatalytic reduction of NAD+ to afford NADH, using semi-
conductors. The objective is to reach a highly efﬁcient and selective reduction of
NAD+ upon visible-light irradiation to 1,4-NADH or other equally active isomers.
To this end, a number of semiconducting materials which behave as photocatalysts
and absorb visible-light, such as: Cu2O, InVO4, TiO2 modiﬁed either with the
organic compound rutin, or with the inorganic complex [CrF5(H2O)]2 [106] and
the doped sulphide Fe/ZnS have been prepared and used for the reduction of NAD+
to NADH. The expected mechanism of NADH regeneration is shown in
Scheme 9.19.
Regeneration of the cofactor NADH from NAD+ has been achieved by using
visible light-active heterogeneous TiO2-based photocatalysts. The efﬁciency of the
regeneration process is enhanced by using a RhIII-complex for facilitating the
electron and hydride transfer from the H-donor (water or a water-glycerol solution)
to NAD+. In this way, 1 mol of NADH was used for producing 100–1000 mol of
CH3OH, opening the way to a practical application using as mediator a
Rh-complex [105].

Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2
Hydrates
Abstract Gas hydrates are clathrate solid crystalline compounds consisting of a
lattice formed by water molecules and entrapped gas molecules inside. They are
stable under high pressure and low temperature. CO2 hydrates, speciﬁcally, are
composed of CO2 as the guest molecule and water as the host molecule. CO2
hydrates have a number of applications including CO2 capture, cold storage, CO2
sequestration, and, lately, the direct displacement of methane hydrates with CO2 to
simultaneously produce methane and sequester CO2. This chapter provides a
comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of CO2 hydrates. The ﬁrst section
gives a general introduction and some basic concepts of gas hydrates. Section 10.2
shifts the focus to the microscopic perspective, looking into how gas hydrates form,
the three structures of gas hydrates, and the characteristics of CO2 hydrates. From
there onward, the text focuses speciﬁcally on CO2 hydrates. The physical properties
of CO2 hydrates are considered in Sect. 10.3. Section 10.4 deals with the phase
equilibrium of CO2 hydrate. Experimental methods and the phase diagram are
shown in this section. The last section covers the applications of CO2 hydrates,
including the formation and dissociation of CO2 hydrates, ocean sequestration, and
the CH4 replacement in hydrates by CO2, which is an attractive potential method to
produce natural gas.

Introduction
Hydrate is a term related to a substance that contains water of crystallization. In
inorganic chemistry, hydrates refer to inorganic salts that have water molecules
crystallized with salt compounds in a deﬁnite ratio. An example is copper sulfate,
which turns from gray-white (anhydrous form) to blue (pentahydrate) upon hydra-
tion. Such hydration can easily be carried out by dissolving anhydrous (water free)
copper sulfate in water and crystallizing. Laboratory research reveals that ﬁve water
molecules occur in a copper sulfate crystal unit, and four of them are attached to the
copper ion by coordination bonds, whereas the ﬁfth is supposed to be held to sulfate

by a hydrogen bond. This chemical compound can be described by the chemical
formula CuSO45H2O.
Another class of hydrates is gas hydrates. Unlike the stoichiometric inorganic
salt hydrates, gas hydrates are nonstoichiometric clathrate solid crystalline sub-
stances consisting of a lattice formed by water molecules (host) and entrapped gas
molecules (guest). They are stable under high pressure and low temperature. The
hydrate formation reaction can be described by the following general equation:
G þ NH H2O ¼ G  NHH2O
where G is the gas molecule and NH is the hydration number, which means the
number of water molecules per gas molecule. Hydrates can form under these three
conditions:
1. The presence of a sufﬁcient amount of water
2. The presence of hydrate former (guest molecules)
3. The right combination of pressure and temperature (high pressure and low
temperature are favorable for hydrate formation)
It should be noted that hydrate formation is not a chemical reaction because no
chemical bond is formed or broken during the reaction. Ofﬁcially, clathrate
hydrates are not chemical compounds but one phase of gas–water mixture. As
discussed in detail in Sect. 10.2, there are basically three types of structures of gas
hydrates. Different structures comprise different types, shapes, sizes, and numbers
of cavities. The polyhedral cavities are spherical-like cages formed by hydrogen-
bonded water molecules, and a guest molecule with suitable size can ﬁt into one
cavity but not be bonded with the lattice, which is quite different than inorganic salt
hydrates. Typically, the guest molecules could be low-molecular-mass gases, such
as H2, Ar, Kr, N2, O2, CH4, Xe, H2S, CO2, and some relatively heavier hydro-
carbons. Gas hydrates can be regarded as highly efﬁcient molecular-level gas
storage. Under ideal conditions, each volume of hydrate is capable of containing
as much as 184 volumes of gas at standard temperature and pressure.
It was in 1810 that clathrate hydrates were ﬁrst discovered by Sir Humphry Davy
(1811), who found that chlorine (known as oxymuriatic gas at that time) in water
could freeze more readily than pure water. Such a frozen substance was what is now
known as the chlorine hydrates. During the century following the discovery of
clathrate hydrates, many more species were found to form gas hydrates. In the
1930s, research on gas hydrates was stimulated upon the conﬁrmation that gas
hydrates are the cause of blockage in gas and oil pipelines, which is a major
problem in the oil and gas industries and may cause signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss.
Since then, considerable investment has been made into research areas such as
phase equilibria, thermodynamic models, and time-dependent kinetic behavior of
gas hydrates. Since the 1960s, after they were found to be commonly located in the
Earth’s permafrost and deep sea regions, gas hydrates are emerging as a potential
energy resource. The majority of natural gas hydrates contain CH4 in overwhelming
abundance. Though this resource has not been systematically mapped and
374

Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2 Hydrates
evaluated, and current estimates vary widely, there is a consensus that the quantity
of natural gas hydrates is vast and the carbon content in natural gas hydrates is far
more than the carbon content in all the conventional fossil fuel resources combined.
Thus, a number of gas hydrates research and development programs have emerged,
including basic scientiﬁc research and ﬁeld-based studies, related to hydrates
exploration and recovery. At the same time, there are ongoing studies of the
environmental and safety aspects of hydrates, for example, the impact of methane
hydrate on climate change. A schematic snapshot of signiﬁcance of gas hydrates or
clathrate hydrates is shown in Fig. 10.1.
CO2 hydrates are composed of CO2 as the guest molecules and water as the host
molecules. The ﬁrst discovery of CO2 hydrates dates back to 1882, when
Wroblewski [1, 2] discovered a white snow-like substance while studying carbonic
acid. He estimated that the composition of CO2 hydrates was approximately
CO28H2O, whereas the hydration number of typical CO2 hydrates is now known
to be between 5.75 and 7.67 [3]. CO2 hydrates have a number of applications
including CO2 capture and CO2 sequestration, and because of the higher stability of
CO2 hydrates compared with that of CH4 hydrates, displacing CH4 directly in the
methane hydrates with CO2 to produce methane and sequester CO2 simultaneously
has recently been proposed.

Introduction
375
The endothermic effect of dissociation of CO2 hydrates makes it possible for
them to be used in refrigeration systems [4–6]. Another point making CO2 hydrates
important is the high possibility of the occurrence of CO2 hydrates on other planets,
especially Mars. Because CO2 is an abundant component of the atmosphere on
Mars, and with the prevailing temperature and pressure conditions, it is suggested
that CO2 hydrates, dry ice, liquid CO2, and carbonated groundwater are common
phases on Mars. The formation and transformation of these phases may play a
signiﬁcant role in the evolution of Martian geology. All the above factors lead to an
increasing interest in the study of CO2 hydrates.
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals and
applications of CO2 hydrates. Section 10.2 focuses on the microscopic perspective,
looking into how gas hydrates form, the three structures of gas hydrates, and the
characteristics of CO2 hydrates. From there onwards, the text focuses speciﬁcally
on CO2 hydrates. The physical properties of CO2 hydrates are considered in
Sect. 10.3. Section 10.4 deals with the phase equilibrium of CO2 hydrate. Exper-
imental methods and the phase diagram are showed in this section. The last section
covers the applications of CO2 hydrates, including the formation and dissociation of
CO2 hydrates, ocean sequestration, the CH4 replacement in hydrates by CO2, and
the use of CO2 hydrates in the refrigeration process.
10.2
Structure of Gas Hydrates
As mentioned before, a gas hydrate unit cell consists of several cavities formed by
hydrogen-bonded water molecules, and guest molecules are trapped in those cavi-
ties, usually in one-in-one form except for a few cases such as hydrogen molecules
whereby more than one can occupy the cages under certain experimental condi-
tions. Although the formation conditions of hydrates vary widely for different guest
molecules, the typical crystal structures are limited to three types: cubic structure I
(sI), cubic structure II (sII), or hexagonal structure H (sH). This section details the
structure of gas hydrates, ﬁrst considering the cavities formed by water molecules,
then describing the three types of structures, and ﬁnally shifting the focus to CO2
hydrates.
10.2.1
Formation of Gas Hydrates from a Microscopic
Perspective
As the major content of gas hydrates, water plays a crucial role in the formation of
the cavities through the extensive H-bonding, which may link each of them to four
others, two through the two lone pairs on oxygen and two through the two polar
hydrogen atoms. The four surrounding molecules are arranged in a tetrahedral
376
10
Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2 Hydrates
manner. The hydrogen bonding has an energy of ca. 7.5 kcal/mol and, because of
such extra energy, water has a higher boiling point, melting point, and viscosity
than other Group 16 element hydrides in which hydrogen bonds are absent or much
weaker. Because it is much more signiﬁcant than the van der Waals interaction,
only the hydrogen bond is considered between adjacent molecules when hydrates
form or dissociate.
Connected by hydrogen bonds, water molecules can form many kinds of three-
dimensional frameworks, which include cavities (polyhedrons) to accommodate
guest molecules. For simplicity, the polygons comprising those cavities are ﬁrst to
be considered here. Computer simulation work shows that the most likely natural
structure in water at many temperatures is the pentamer, followed by hexamers and
squares [7]. Molecular dynamics studies suggest that cyclic pentamer comprising
many hydrate cavities is the only stable ﬁve-member cluster above 230 K [8]. More
generally, it was claimed that closed rings were often more stable than open chains
of the same cluster number, because of the extra energy of the hydrogen bond
[9]. From another perspective, regarding planar rings, the OOO angle of
pentagons is 108, which is very similar to the normal water angle (104.5) and
the tetrahedral angle (109.5), leading to the least strain on the bonds. Furthermore,
the OOO angles of squares (90) and the hexagons (120) deviate more but are
still acceptable. However, if the number of edges becomes larger than six or less
than four, the strains are so high that such polygons occur infrequently in water
structures.
Based on the three available types of polygons mentioned above, ﬁve types of
polyhedra are mainly found in the three structures of gas hydrates. As shown in
Fig. 10.2, they are pentagonal dodecahedron (512), tetrakaidecahedron (51262),
hexakaidecahedron (51264), irregular dodecahedron (435663), and icosahedron
(51268). The formalism Xn is used to describe the structure of each cavity, where
X denotes the type of cage face (4–square, 5–pentagon, and 6–hexagon), and
n represents the number of such kinds of face in that cavity. The three structures
of gas hydrates comprise different cavities: 512 and 51262 cavities form sI, 512 and
51264 cavities form sII, and sH is formed by 512, 435663, and 51268 cavities.
The pentagonal dodecahedron (512) has 12 pentagonal faces with equal edge
lengths and equal angles. It is the most common basic building block present in
almost all gas hydrate structures. It can be seen from Fig. 10.2 that each 512 cavity
contains 20 water molecules, as each vertex represents an oxygen atom. However,
when it comes to the gas hydrate unit cell, the average number of water molecules
per guest is not 20 anymore because those cavities are connected by sharing faces,
edges, or vertices. Also note that there are 30 bonds (edges) displayed in the 512
cavity: as mentioned before, only one hydrogen atom lies between the adjacent two
oxygen atoms, thus 30 hydrogen atoms are shown in this ﬁgure, whereas the other
10 hydrogen atoms protrude from the cavity, potentially making attachment to
other cavities or molecules. It is suggested that this 512 cavity structure is the most
unstrained polyhedra compared with other clathrate clusters, and therefore geomet-
rically favored by nature [11]. The tetrakaidecahedron (51262) has 12 pentagonal
and 2 hexagonal faces. Each 51262 cavity contains 24 water molecules. This 51262
10.2
Structure of Gas Hydrates
377
cavity is the least spherical cavity in sI and sII. The hexakaidecahedron (51264) has
12 pentagonal faces and 4 hexagonal faces. Those 4 hexagonal faces distribute
symmetrically and each of them is surrounded by 6 pentagonal faces with sharing
edges. Each 51264 cavity contains 28 water molecules. This cavity is the most
spherical cavity of the ﬁve types. The irregular dodecahedron (435663) has 3 square
faces, 6 pentagonal faces, and 3 hexagonal faces. Each 435663 cavity contains
20 water molecules. Because of the high proportion of square and hexagonal
faces, the 435663 cavity becomes the most strained one, which may indicate a
slow kinetics of formation. The icosahedron (51268) has 12 pentagonal faces and
8 hexagonal faces, 6 of which form a girdle and the other 2 as the top and bottom
faces. Each 51268 cavity contains 36 water molecules. It is clear that the 51268 cavity
is the largest of the ﬁve types and allows a larger occupant. It is also the most
non-spherical one of all ﬁve cavities.
10.2.2
Crystal Structures of Gas Hydrates
All gas hydrates have repetitive crystal units, and a unit cell consists of several
cavities sharing faces, edges, and/or vertices, with guest molecules trapped in those

cavities [12]. The most common unit cell structures found in gas hydrates are
named as structure I (sI), structure II (sII), and structure H (sH). Some character-
istics of the three structures are showed in Table 10.1. Figure 10.3 shows the
appearance of these structures.
Structure I comprises two 512 cavities and six 51262 cavities, formed by 46 water
molecules. It is clear from Fig. 10.3a that one 512 cavity is located at each of the
eight vertices. Considering the surrounding unit cells, each of the vertices only
contains 1/8 of a 512 cavity. By adding the 512 cavity at the center of the structure,
the total number of 512 cavities becomes two per unit cell. For the 51262 cavities,
each of the six faces contains two halves of 51262 cavities and the total number
becomes six. Similar calculation can be done on other structures.
Structure II (see Fig. 10.3b) is a face-centered cubic lattice, consisting of 16 512
cavities and 8 51264 cavities. Each unit cell of sII contains 136 water molecules.
This structure can be regarded as completely deﬁned by 512 cavities (which share
the pentagonal faces), whereas the residual voids form the 51264 cavities (which
share all the hexagonal faces). The two kinds of cavities are connected by sharing
pentagonal faces.
Structure H (see Fig. 10.3c) is a hexagonal rather than cubic cell, consisting of
3 512 cavities, 2 435663 cavities and 1 51268 cavity, in total 34 water molecules.
Considering a single unit cell, four 51268 cavities are located at the vertices of a
rhombus. Looking at the middle level plane, each of the six hexagonal faces on the
girdle of 51268 cavity is shared with a 435663 cavity, resulting in six 435663 cavities
surrounding a 51268 cavity. 435663 cavities are connected only through square faces
with each other. All pentagonal faces of these two types of cavity are shared with
512 cavities.
Apart from the framework formed by water molecules, the guest molecules are
also very important to the unit cell structure. It is believed that the hydrate structure
is stabilized mainly by the repulsive van der Waals interactions between guest
molecules and cage walls. Without the support of guest molecules, the lattice
structure may easily collapse to an ice crystal structure or liquid water. Typically,
every cavity contains only one guest molecule, although at very high pressure some
low-molecular-mass gas may multiply occupy the large cavities. The volume of

Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2 Hydrates
cavities vary with temperature, pressure, and the size and shape of the guest
molecules. Average and effective diameters of cavities are shown in Table 10.1.
Both sI and sII have 512 cavities, with effective diameters of 5.1 Å and 5.02 Å,
respectively. Though the difference is small, it reﬂects on the size of guest mole-
cules. For example, oxygen (with diameter of 4.2 Å) occupies the 512 cavity of
structure II, whereas methane (with diameter of 4.36 Å), though only slightly larger,
occupies the 512 cavity of structure I. As for the large cages in sI and sII (51262 and
51264 cavities), the larger diameter makes them able to contain molecules of larger
size. For some guest molecules with sizes between the small and large cages, they
only occupy the large cages but leave the small ones vacant. For sH, the size
difference between the small and large cavities is so signiﬁcant that two kinds of
guest molecules with different sizes are required to stabilize the structure. For
example, methane and neohexane can form sH hydrates, in which methane
occupies the small (512) and medium (435663) cavities whereas neohexane enters
the large cavities (51268).
In order to describe the ratio of water molecules to gas molecules in hydrates,
hydration number is deﬁned as the number of water molecules per guest. Take ideal
N2 hydrates as an example; N2 occupies all the small and large cages of sII,
resulting in the formula 24N2136H2O, i.e., 5(2/3) H2O per N2. If the guest
molecules only occupy the 8 large cages, such as C3H8, then the hydration number
becomes 17. Similarly, CO2 forms sI; the ideal occupancy (complete occupancy of
CO2 in small and large cages) yields a hydration number of 5(3/4) H2O per CO2. It
is noted that, for the case of CO2, it has been experimentally shown that CO2 can
occupy almost all of the large cages (>90%) although it occupies a fraction of the
small cages, typically in the range of 20–60% depending upon the formation
experimental conditions. As for sH, the concept of hydration number is only
applicable for multi-guests. It is interesting that, under ideal condition, the mole
fractions of water in the three structures are all around 85%. However, it is unlikely
that all cages could be occupied in simple hydrates by guest molecules (hydrates
with only one kind of guest). For example, the real formula of sI hydrates usually
ranges between G·5(3/4)H2O to G·19H2O, which depends on the guest composi-
tion, temperature, and pressure. Such variation is called the non-stoichiometry of
gas hydrates, which distinguishes them from the stoichiometric salt hydrates in
inorganic chemistry.
10.2.3
Characteristics of CO2 Hydrates
Different from most gas hydrate formers, CO2 is not hydrophobic. At 273 K, the
solubility of CO2 in water varies between 0.08 and 1.46 mol/L with the partial
pressure of CO2 between 0.1 and 3.4 MPa [14]. The dissolution of CO2 in water
produces species including dissolved unhydrated CO2, hydrated CO2, H2CO3,
HCO
3 , and CO2
3 .

Structure of Gas Hydrates
381
Carbon dioxide is known to form regular cubic sI as simple hydrates, although
there is also some evidence which indicates a metastable sII CO2 hydrate phase at
temperatures near the ice melting point [15]. Stabilization is the major consider-
ation when determining which structure gas hydrates form. For CO2 hydrates, the
diameter ratios of guest molecule to host cavities play a dominant role in stabilizing
the structure. The ratios of molecular diameter of CO2 to cavity diameter are shown
in Table 10.2, with the diameter of CO2 selected as 5.12 Å. For simple (single guest)
hydrate formers, usually a size ratio higher than 0.76 is required to ensure the cavity
stability. CO2 forms regular cubic sI as simple hydrates. As can be seen in
Table 10.2, for large cavity in sII, the size ratio is 0.769, indicating less cavity
stability and therefore difﬁculty in forming a stable sII hydrate for CO2 as a single
guest. It is noted that there is evidence in literature that, for mixed hydrates with a
hydrate former such as propane occupying the large cage of sII and thus making it
stable, CO2 has been shown to occupy the large cages in such a resultant mixed sII
hydrates. For the large cavities the size ratio in sI is 0.843, although it is 0.769 for
sII, indicating less signiﬁcant cavity stability. Hence as a simple hydrate former,
CO2 forms sI.
Representing the hydrates composition, the hydration number of sI hydrates can
be obtained from the equation
NH ¼
46
2θs þ 6θl
where NH is the hydration number, θs is the degree of occupancy of small cages, and
θl is the degree of occupancy of large cages.
Hydration number can be obtained experimentally through macroscopic
methods using the enthalpies of formation/dissociation [16] or gas uptake/release
during formation/dissociation [17]. Another class of approaches is microscopic
methods, including X-ray and neutron diffraction and Raman and NMR spectro-
scopy. For CO2 hydrates, data from a neutron diffraction study [18] indicate that,
at a pressure of 6.2 MPa and temperature between 230 and 263 K, more than 95% of
the large cages can be ﬁlled and the small cage occupancy is between 60% and
80%, yielding a hydration number between 6.05 and 6.67.

Physical Properties of CO2 Hydrates
CO2 hydrates are snow-like substance which can exist below 283 K at a wide range
of pressures. Because CO2 sequestration into the deep ocean has become a hot
potential approach to dispose of CO2, the physical properties of CO2 hydrates are
important to the feasibility study and modeling of CO2 deposition. For example, the
density of CO2 hydrates is needed to determine whether they sink or ﬂoat at certain
depths of the ocean, which is a major problem when modeling the CO2 dispersion.
This section details the mechanical, thermal, and other physical properties of CO2

hydrates. Because there is a lack of data for CO2 hydrates, for some parts, the
properties of some other common gas hydrates are shown, which may indicate the
properties of CO2 hydrates based on the similarity between gas hydrates.
10.3.1
Mechanical Properties
Generally, the mechanical strength of pure gas hydrates is much higher than that of
ice (Ih). For example, Durham et al. [19] measured the creep resistance of methane
hydrates and found it more than 20 times stronger than ice. This may be because of
the much lower diffusion rate of water in hydrates compared to ice, limiting the
motion of crystalline defects. However, when it comes to the hydrates-bearing
sample, the mechanical strength may be much smaller than that of pure hydrates
because of the liquid water or ice in the sample. It is believed that the strength
increases with increasing hydrate saturation (the proportion of the hydrate volume
to pore volume in the sample).
The elastic properties of hydrates are important to understanding the sonic and
seismic velocity ﬁeld data obtained from the natural hydrates-bearing sediments.
Data on the mechanical properties of CO2 hydrates are limited. Table 10.3 shows
the elastic properties of ice, CH4 hydrates, and CO2 hydrates. It should be noted that
these properties may vary for different guests and occupancies. For example, Kiefte
et al. [21] measured the compressional velocity of methane, propane, and hydrogen
sulﬁde hydrates as 3.3, 3.7, and 3.35 km/s, respectively.
10.3.2
Thermal Properties
Thermal transport in the bulk medium is one of most important factors that affect
the phase transformation of gas hydrates. Thermal properties are needed to estimate
the heat transfer in hydrates sediments. Thermal properties of gas hydrates vary a

little between different guest molecules, and thus the data from other gas hydrates
can only provide an approximation for CO2 hydrates.
The thermal conductivity of gas hydrates is dependent on temperature, but has
no pressure dependence. Table 10.4 shows the thermal conductivities of ice, water,
CO2 hydrates, and methane hydrates.
It is clear that the thermal conductivity of gas hydrates is much less than that of
ice, but similar to liquid water. Furthermore, when it comes to hydrate/gas/water or
hydrate/gas/water/sediment systems, the thermal properties are usually determined
as the average values of the properties of the components by considering their
saturation (volumetric fraction) in the sample. Because of the paucity of data of
CO2 hydrates, the heat capacities of ice, methane and ethane hydrates are shown in
Table 10.5. Considering the similarity between CO2 hydrates and other gas
hydrates, the heat capacity of CO2 hydrates is certainly less than that of liquid
water and may be similar to that of ice.
Another thermal property is thermal expansion, which is important when esti-
mating the density of CO2 hydrates. Udachin et al. [26] combined his results with
others’ work and obtained the lattice parameter for CO2 hydrates as a polynomial
function of temperature as follows:
a ¼ 11:81945  9:08711  105T þ 4:59676  106T2  8:35548  109T3
where a represents the lattice parameter with unit Å and T is the temperature with

This function suggests that the lattice parameter, and thereby the volume, of CO2
hydrates grows monotonically with the temperature within the range in which
hydrates exist. It is worth noting that the thermal expansion of the CO2 hydrates
is much greater than that of ice.
10.3.3
Other Physical Properties
One of the advantages of gas hydrates is the signiﬁcant volume reduction compared
with the original gaseous phase. For example, if all cavities of sI are occupied, one
volume of hydrate may contain 184 volumes of gas at standard temperature and
pressure. Speciﬁcally, it is estimated that the maximum density of CO2 hydrates is
1.13 g/cm3, assuming the ideal (full) occupancy of CO2 molecules in the cavities.
On the other hand, if no guest molecule occupies the cages of sI, the density would
be 0.796 g/cm3 [27]. In actual conditions, however, the occupancy must be less than
the ideal situation. By using microscopic observation techniques, such as X-ray and
neutron diffraction, it is possible to obtain the cage occupancies (which can be used
to calculate the hydrate composition) and lattice parameters (which depend on
temperature and can be used to calculate the volume of hydrate unit cells). With
these data, one can estimate the density of CO2 hydrates. For example, in a Udachin
et al. study [26], the lattice parameter of CO2 hydrates was measured as 11.893 Å at
173 K, and the composition was 7.42CO246H2O, yielding the density as 1.14 g/
cm3, and when the temperature increased to 277 K, the lattice parameter became
11.970 Å, resulting in a density of 1.12 g/cm3. The main uncertainty of the density
estimated this way arises from the cage occupancy, which may be affected by the
pressure. Generally, the density of CO2 hydrates formed under deep sea conditions
is slightly higher than that of liquid CO2 (around 1.05 g/cm3) under the same
conditions.

Phase Equilibrium of CO2 Hydrate
10.4.1
Experimental Methods to Study Hydrate Phase
Equilibria
Knowledge of CO2 hydrate formation conditions is very important for rational and
design of processes in CO2 capture and sequestration. Several studies have focused
on determination of incipient CO2 hydrate formation conditions. The condition at
which an inﬁnitesimal amount of hydrate phase is present in equilibrium with liquid
phases is referred to as incipient hydrate formation condition [28]. Using different
experimental methods, macroscopic hydrate phase equilibrium can be determined
386
10
Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2 Hydrates
by employing a traditional stirred tank reactor with vigorous mixing. The four
different methods are:
1. Temperature search method
2. Pressure search method
3. P-T cycle method
4. Calorimetric method
All these methods were used to determine phase equilibrium above the ice point,
i.e., LW–H–V line.
10.4.1.1
Temperature Search Method
This method operates at isobaric condition (constant pressure). The crystallizer
with a gas–liquid system is set to pressures at which the hydrate equilibrium
temperature needs to be determined. Initially the pressure of the system drops
because of dissolution of the gas into the liquid caused by mixing. The pressure
of the system is maintained constant by a supply of gas from the reservoir or ﬂuid
withdrawal. The system temperature is decreased to induce hydrate formation. The
pressure of the system drops because of cooling and hydrate formation. After
hydrate formation, the temperature of the system is increased slowly until an
inﬁnitesimal amount of hydrate crystals exists in equilibrium with the vapor and
liquid phases. During heating, the system pressure is maintained constant by ﬂuid
withdrawal. This point is recorded as equilibrium condition. The equilibrium point
is determined by visual observation.
10.4.1.2
Pressure Search Method
This method operates at isothermal condition (constant temperature). The crystal-
lizer was precooled to the temperature at which the equilibrium pressure needs to be
determined. The system was then set to a pressure higher than the equilibrium
condition. The crystallizer content was mixed and the pressure of the crystallizer
drops because of gas dissolution and hydrate formation. As the hydrates form, the
temperature of the liquid–gas system increases and is restored back by external
cooling. After hydrate formation, the pressure is reduced gradually until inﬁnite-
simal amount of hydrate crystals exists in equilibrium with the vapor and liquid
phases. The equilibrium pressure is determined by visual observation of the hydrate
crystal disappearance.
10.4.1.3
Isochoric P–T Cycle
This method operates at isochoric condition (constant volume). A P–T cycle
method is illustrated in Fig. 10.4. The crystallizer content is mixed after pressuriz-
ing with the gas.
10.4
Phase Equilibrium of CO2 Hydrate
387
The system was allowed to reach a steady state. At this time, the system is far
enough from the hydrate stable region. Upon pressure and temperature stabili-
zation, the temperature of the system is lowered and the pressure drops because
of slight cooling. At point B, a catastrophic hydrate formation leads to a sudden
decrease in pressure. The temperature is then slowly increased to dissociate the
formed hydrates. During the dissociation of the hydrate crystals inside the hydrate
stable region, the increase in temperature increases the pressure gradually whereas,
outside the hydrate stable region, a slight increase in pressure is observed. On the
pressure–temperature diagram, the equilibrium point is the point at which the
heating curve (hydrate dissociation trace) intersects with the cooling curve (Point
D) or a change in slope of the dissociation trace is observed. This method is an
alternative to visual observation of the hydrate crystal disappearance.
10.4.1.4
Calorimetric Method
As an alternative to these classical PVT methods, a calorimetric method can be used
to determine the hydrate phase equilibrium [29–31]. A high pressure differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) is employed. The high pressure cell in the DSC is
loaded with the solution and then pressurized with the hydrate forming gas. The cell
is then cooled to a lower temperature to form hydrate. An exothermic peak is
observed in the DSC thermograph because of hydrate formation. The cell is then
heated at a constant rate to dissociate the hydrate crystal. DSC thermography shows
an endothermic peak during hydrate dissociation. The onset temperature of the
endothermic peak is taken as the equilibrium temperature at the given pressure. The
PVT and DSC results are in good agreement with each other [31].

Pressure–Temperature Phase Diagram of CO2 + H2O
System
Equilibrium hydrate formation condition for CO2 has been extensively investigated
and available in the literature [32–44]. A hydrate phase diagram of the CO2 + H2O
system is presented in Fig. 10.5. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, equilibrium hydrate
formation conditions above and below freezing point of water is presented.
The CO2 vapor pressure curve is also presented. The lower quadruple point
(Q1 ¼ I–LW–H–V) is located at the intersection of I–H–V and LW–H–V lines. The
upper quadruple point (Q2 ¼ LW–H–V–LCO2) is located at the intersection of the
LW–H–V and LW–H–LCO2 lines. The H–V–LCO2 and LW–V–LCO2 originate at
point Q2. Lines I–H–V, LW–H–V, and LW–H–LCO2 bound the hydrate formation
region. Hydrates can form at higher pressures and lower temperatures to the left of
the region enclosed by these three lines. Hydrates are unstable if we move towards
the right from these three lines. Above the H–V–LCO2 line the hydrates form from
liquid CO2 whereas below this line gas CO2 takes part in hydrate formation.

Applications of CO2 Hydrates
10.5.1
Formation of CO2 Hydrate
Following the thermodynamics (phase equilibrium) of CO2 hydrate, which is time-
independent, it is also important to know the time-dependent phenomenon of
hydrate, namely, how hydrates form and dissociate. Note that the study of such
phenomena is much more challenging than that of the thermodynamic properties.
Figure 10.6 shows typical crystallization kinetics of the formation of CO2
hydrate. The gas was contacted with the known amount of water in a semi-batch
manner, i.e., pressure and temperature of the system is maintained constant. The
pressure and temperature of the crystallizer is set at the hydrate stable region. The
hydrate crystallization kinetics curve has three different phases. First the dissolu-
tion phase where the gas dissolves into the liquid. The moles of gas uptake at Point
A corresponds to the three-phase hydrate equilibrium pressure at the experimental
temperature. Further gas dissolves and the gas uptake plateaus off. Although the
conditions are favorable for hydrate formation, hydrate crystals do not form imme-
diately. This ability to maintain a non-equilibrium state is called metastability. The
region between points A and B is characterized by the nucleation process. Nucle-
ation is the restructuring of water and guest molecules into stable nuclei with
critical size, followed by growth on these nuclei. The period during which the
temperature and pressure conditions are within the hydrate stable zone but no
hydrate is detected is usually called the induction period (in Fig. 10.6 this period
begins at point B and ends when signiﬁcant pressure drop occurs). At point C, the
metastable state is ruptured and hydrate starts to form. A temperature spike can be
observed because of the exothermic nature of hydrate formation. Along with the
formation of hydrate, the gas uptake increases rapidly to point C. The region
between points B and C is termed the hydrate growth phase. After some time the
gas uptake plateaus off because of no further hydrate formation. The time taken for
the hydrate growth to reach the plateau varies according to the crystallizer

conﬁgurations. Usually it takes few hours in a stirred tank reactor for the hydrate
growth to cease because of mass transfer limitation.
The formation of hydrate nuclei in a CO2–water mixture is in the form of
heterogeneous nucleation. Unlike homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucle-
ation occurs with a foreign body (e.g., inorganic crystals, clays and sands in natural
waters, and any impurities in laboratory waters) or at a surface such as ﬂuid interface
and container wall. Foreign bodies may serve as catalysts during the nucleation
process, and the interface could decrease the Gibbs free energy of nucleation.
At the molecular level, several mechanisms of hydrate formation are proposed
but no agreement has been achieved. For example, the labile cluster nucleation
hypothesis suggests that a “prehydrate” structure is ﬁrst formed by liquid water
molecules surrounding a dissolved solute molecule, with the essential correct
coordination number. Then those clusters of dissolved species combine to form
unit cells by sharing faces. When the cluster agglomerate achieves a critical radius,
growth starts. During the growth process, for the ﬁrst step, a temporal water cluster
containing a guest is transported to the surface of the growing crystal. The follow-
ing steps involve the adsorption and stabilization of the cluster onto the crystal.
Generally, the growth occurs at the interface because of the high concentrations of
guest and host molecules there. It should be noted that nucleation as well as
induction time is stochastic and therefore unpredictable. The induction time is
proved to depend on the characteristics of the apparatus, history of water, gas
composition, presence of foreign particles, and so on.
10.5.2
Dissociation of CO2 Hydrate
In contrast to hydrate formation, hydrate dissociation is an endothermic process in
which energy is consumed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules
and the van der Waals interaction between the guest and water molecules, with the
production of water and gas. At around 273 K, the measured dissociation heat of
CO2 hydrate varies between 57.66 and 65.22 kJ/mol, with the hydration number of
6.21–7.23 [45–47]. For hydrate with single guest, the amount of heat absorbed by
dissociation is equal to that released by formation. As an endothermic process, the
hydrate dissociation is typically dominated by heat transfer but not intrinsic
kinetics.
There are several approaches to dissociate hydrates: depressurization, thermal
stimulation, thermodynamic inhibitor injection, or a combination of these methods.
By depressurization or thermal stimulation, hydrate can be moved across the phase
equilibrium line to the unstable zone. However, inhibitor injection does not aim to
change the temperature or pressure conditions of the hydrate but switch the phase
equilibrium line to a lower temperature and a higher pressure, leaving the hydrate in
the unstable zone.
Based on its formation and dissociation, CO2 hydrate has many potential appli-
cations. As described in detail later, ocean sequestration and CH4/CO2 replacement
10.5
Applications of CO2 Hydrates

are based on the formation of CO2 hydrate, and the application in refrigeration
systems makes use of the dissociation of CO2 hydrate.
10.5.3
CO2 Capture and Sequestration
It is widely known that CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases responsible for
global warming. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been considered as a
means of reducing the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere from fossil fuel use.
CO2 hydrates can play an important role both in CO2 capture and sequestration.
The main CO2 source comes from ﬂue gas (N2 + CO2) generated by power
plants. Other feed gases for CO2 separation may be the shifted synthesis gas
(H2 + CO2) and natural gas or biogas (CH4 + CO2). There are several methods to
separate CO2 from gas mixtures, including chemical absorption, cryogenic fraction-
ation, selective adsorption, and membrane separation. Apart from these, CO2
hydrate separation is a relatively novel technology for CO2 capture. This techno-
logy, called hydrate-based CO2 capture (HBCC), is based on selective partitioning
of CO2 between the gaseous and hydrate phase. Speciﬁcally, the hydrate formation
pressure at 273 K for CO2 (1.22 MPa) is lower than N2 (16.3 MPa), H2 (213 MPa),
O2 (11.1 MPa), and CH4 (2.65 MPa) [48]. Consequently, compared to the other
major components in the mixture, CO2 is easier to form hydrates and therefore can
be separated by hydrate formation. Figure 10.7 illustrates the simplest idea of

HBCC by a single stage. For improvement, this may be combined with a second
stage or some other separation methods to increase the efﬁciency of separation.
Some additives such as THF (tetrahydrofuran) can also be added during the
separation process to lower the equilibrium pressure for economic and safety
concern. HBCC is of high capacity and easy to operate. It is free from contami-
nation because only water is the major raw material. At the same time, CO2 can be
stored in hydrates after separation, making it is easier for transport and disposal.
Further improvements can be made to increase the energy efﬁciency and lower the
cost of this separation scheme.
Another main source of CO2 is from the fuel gas generated by power plants such
as integrated gasiﬁcation combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. A typical
pre-treated fuel gas exiting the IGCC power plant consists of 40% CO2 in hydrogen
in the pressure range of 2–7 MPa [49]. This pressure range is suitable for hydrate
formation and preferential incorporation of CO2 over H2 in hydrate phase makes
hydrate-based gas separation (HBGS) feasible for CO2 capture from fuel gas
mixture. Moreover, the CO2 capacity of the HBGS process is very high compared
to that of commercial physical solvents such as Selexol and Rectisol. Extensive
studies have been reported demonstrating the HBGS process employing different
reactor conﬁgurations and different promoters under various experimental condi-
tions [50–54]. To align the operating pressure in line with the fuel gas mixture
pressure range, several promoters such as propane [55–59], tetrahydrofuran [60–
62], cyclopentane (CP) [29, 63–65], tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) [52,
60, 66–68], tetra-n-butyl ammonium nitrate (TBANO3) [69, 70], and tetra-n-butyl
ammonium ﬂuoride (TBAF) [71] are employed. Traditional stirred tank reactors
were not suitable because of slow kinetics of hydrate formation. The slow kinetics
is mainly because of the mass transfer limitation caused by agglomeration of
hydrate crystals at the liquid–gas interface. To overcome the mass transfer limita-
tion, a ﬁxed bed reactor conﬁguration was employed with different porous media.
Silica sand, PU foam, glass beads, and silica gel were employed as porous media
[51, 55, 56, 72]. Enhanced kinetics was reported in silica sand and PU foam
compared to silica gel, suggesting that interstitial interconnectivity of pore space
is important for hydrate formation [56, 57].
Following CO2 capture, CO2 sequestration is essential to the reduction of CO2
emission as it aims to store CO2 for a long term. There are three main technologies
to store CO2 – geological sequestration, terrestrial sequestration, and ocean seques-
tration. Geological sequestration uses underground geological formations such as
depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, and coal seams to store CO2. The
storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is considered to be economically favorable
but the storage potential is limited. For the saline aquifers and coal seams storage,
the risk of CO2 leakage may be high and further study is needed. Terrestrial
sequestration uses plants to absorb CO2. As a natural process of the carbon cycle,
absorption of CO2 by the global biosphere equals roughly one-third of the global
carbon emission from human activities. The major objectives of this approach are to
protect the current ecosystem and enhance the CO2 absorption process. The idea of
ocean sequestration is easy to understand, considering that the ocean stores a huge
10.5
Applications of CO2 Hydrates
393
amount of CO2 by absorption. It is estimated that 38 100 GtC (gigatonnes of
carbon) is stored in the ocean whereas there is only 610 GtC in the global
ecosystems. However, the kinetics of ocean absorption is slow and ocean acidiﬁ-
cation is another concern. Although many researchers focus on the mechanisms of
CO2 absorption in the ocean, another potential way is to store CO2 at the deep ocean
ﬂoor in terms of CO2 hydrates, which is thermodynamically feasible.
Figure 10.8 shows the phase diagram of CO2 in seawater (with a salinity of 34)
and the ocean temperature proﬁle. It is clear that CO2 can form hydrate below a
certain depth in the sea. Several scenarios have been proposed for CO2 sequestra-
tion in the ocean: (1) sequestering CO2 on the bottom of the sea (deeper than
3 500 m), (2) injecting liquid CO2 deeper than 1 000 m of the sea, and (3) injecting
CO2 gas into the shallow sea (within the hydrate stability zone). However, all these
schemes have economic and environmental challenges. The cost is much higher for
deeper injection because of the long pipeline and high pressure. The shallow
injection, though less expensive, may not be effective for long-term sequestration
of CO2 because of the high chance of CO2 escaping to the atmosphere from the sea.
The high CO2 concentration and low pH near the injection area may also pose a risk
to the ocean ecosystem. Considering the environmental issue, it is suggested to
sequester CO2 in the ocean sediments, where CO2 hydrates can be ﬁxed. Such
geological trapping makes it more promising to reduce the leakage of CO2. Fur-
thermore, to overcome the economic barrier, it is proposed to inject CO2 into the
natural gas hydrates reservoirs to produce natural gas while sequestering CO2. This
is introduced in the following section. Overall, the ocean sequestration of CO2 is

still in its early stage of development and the evaluation of technical feasibility and
environmental impacts is ongoing.
10.5.4
Replacement of CH4 by CO2 in Naturally Occurring
Hydrates
Natural gas (mainly CH4) has become a more and more attractive fuel because it
burns more cleanly than other fossil fuels. According to the statistical review of
world energy by BP, the world consumed about 3.348 trillion m3 of natural gas in
2013, and the amount is growing. This huge and growing demand for natural gas
attracts attention to unconventional natural gas resources. Natural gas hydrate,
found widely distributed under the deep ocean and in permafrost regions, is a
very promising potential energy resource. Although with great uncertainty, it is
estimated that totally 200–120 000 trillion m3 of natural gas (STP) exists in the form
of gas hydrate. Even the most conservative estimate signiﬁcantly surpasses the
amount of conventional fossil fuel reserves. Three exploitation methods are pro-
posed to extract natural gas from hydrates, including (1) depressurization, (2) ther-
mal stimulation, and (3) inhibitor injection. Another scheme combines the recovery
of natural gas with the sequestration of CO2, that is, to use CO2 to replace CH4
trapped in hydrates. This idea becomes attractive because it can simultaneously
sequester CO2 and produce natural gas, alleviating the total cost and making the
most beneﬁts, both economically and environmentally.
The feasibility of the replacement scheme is based on the thermodynamics of
CH4 and CO2 hydrates equilibrium. Figure 10.9 illustrates the hydrate formation
conditions of CO2 and CH4. In certain regions (A and B in the ﬁgure), CO2 can form
hydrate at lower pressure and higher temperature than CH4. Moreover, the heat
released from the exothermic formation of CO2 hydrate is more than the dissoci-
ation heat of CH4 hydrate. CH4 hydrate can also be heated by the sensible heat of
injected CO2. Consequently, when CO2 (as gas in region A or as liquid in region B)
is injected into CH4 hydrate-bearing sediments, it can assist the dissociation of CH4
hydrate and simultaneously form CO2 hydrate. Another beneﬁt of the replacement
reaction is that the formation of CO2 hydrate could preserve the stability of
sediment during the recovery process.
For real conditions, the pressure and temperature proﬁles in the permafrost seem
to lie close to region A and B. However, under the deep sea ﬂoor, the pressure
usually exceeds 10 MPa, and the equilibrium temperature of CO2 hydrate is lower
than that of CH4 hydrate at the same pressure, which means CO2 ﬁnds it harder to
form hydrate than CH4. Hence, the liquid CO2 injected may not be able to form
hydrate itself while it dissociates CH4 hydrate. If CO2 is not stored as hydrate but in
liquid form, the stability of the reservoir may not be maintained, resulting in the risk
of escape of CH4 and CO2. This problem could be avoided if there is a permeability
10.5
Applications of CO2 Hydrates
395
barrier such as a lithological stratum to prevent CO2 and dissociated CH4 from
being released out to the sea bed.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the actual behavior of hydrate formation
and dissociation depends on not only the pressure and temperature of the location
but also many other factors, such as the properties of the in situ methane hydrate,
the amount of injected CO2, and the characteristics of the pore media. More
research needs to be done on the kinetics and mechanism of the interchange of
guests, the effects of the above factors, and the equilibrium conditions of gas
hydrate with liquid CO2 [74]. Overall, the replacement of CH4 in hydrates with
CO2 is a potential method for both recovery of natural gas and long-term storage of
CO2. For the ﬁrst consideration, this method should be used for selected reservoirs
with suitable in situ pressure and temperature conditions that are favorable for the
exchange process.
10.5.5
CO2 Hydrates in Refrigeration Processes
The key basis of the refrigeration process is that a space can be cooled by the
endothermic phase change of refrigerant. The latent heat of evaporation of some
common refrigerants is around 200 kJ/kg. Because of its high latent heat of
dissociation (374 kJ/kghydrate), CO2 hydrate has a great potential to be used in
refrigeration processes.

Thermodynamics and Applications of CO2 Hydrates
Scheme 10.1 shows a conceptual design of a clathrate hydrate-based refriger-
ation system. Hydrate is formed in the forming reactor at relatively high temper-
ature (exceeding that of the warm environment) and pressure, releasing heat to the
warm environment. Then the hydrate slurry is pumped to the dissociating reactor,
the slurry pump working as an expansion valve which conveys hydrate slurry to a
state with a lower pressure and temperature (lower than that of the refrigerated
space). The dissociation of hydrate in the dissociating reactor absorbs heat from the
environment and therefore cools the space. After dissociation, the separated gas and
water are compressed to the forming reactor by a multiphase compressor to
continue this cycle.
Although there is a lack of data for the CO2 hydrate-based refrigeration system,
Ogawa et al. [75] simulated the refrigeration system shown in Scheme 10.1 using
cyclopentane and CH2F2 as working medium (hydrate formers), and revealed that
the coefﬁcient of performance (COP, ratio of cooling capacity to electrical energy
consumed) of the system could be as high as 8 when the hydrate formation and
dissociation temperatures were 298.5 K and 280.5 K, respectively. Such perfor-
mance is really promising as the COP for conventional refrigeration systems is
around 4.
Because the formation temperature of CO2 hydrate is still well below that of the
normal environment (say 303–313 K), there is a limitation for the use of it as a
direct refrigerant for air conditioning. However, it is possible to use CO2 hydrate as
a secondary refrigerant. In a cooling system with secondary refrigeration, the
secondary refrigerant is used to transfer heat from the space being cooled to a
heat exchanger where the heat is absorbed by a primary refrigerant. A secondary
refrigerant is often used in large refrigeration systems to transport cooling capacity
from the plant room to the distributed points of use. Such a system has many
advantages and the main points include: (1) the amount of primary refrigerant,
usually traditional environment-unfriendly, can be minimized, because it only ﬁlls
the pipelines in the plant room – meanwhile the cold is distributed by the secondary
refrigerant, which is an environment-friendly ﬂuid; (2) the primary refrigerant
remains in the plant room and enables close supervision and control, allowing the
use of some hazardous but efﬁcient refrigerants (e.g., NH3); (3) the overall efﬁ-
ciency could increase or at least be equal to the single refrigeration system.
Currently, ice slurry is one of the common secondary refrigerants. CO2 hydrate
slurry becomes more promising not only because its latent heat of dissociation
(374 kJ/kghydrate) is higher than the latent heat of melting of ice (333 kJ/kgice), but
also the formation conditions of CO2 hydrate (278–293 K) are more adaptable to air
conditioning applications.

Another application of the cooling capacity of CO2 hydrate is cold storage. As a
means to alleviate peak loading of electricity, cold storage uses spare electricity
(usually during the night) to form cold storage media (e.g., ice), which is then used
for cooling during the peak periods with high electricity demand. Compared to ice,
CO2 hydrate has a higher cold storage density (which would reduce the size of
equipment) and can work at a temperature closer to environmental temperature,
leading to a higher COP. CO2 hydrate is a promising candidate for refrigeration and
air conditioning use. The study of CO2 hydrate as a refrigerant and cold storage
medium is ongoing. Attempts are being made to decrease the equilibrium pressure,
increase dissociation enthalpy, and enhance formation process and gas solubility.
