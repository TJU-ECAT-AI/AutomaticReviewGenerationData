Abstract
Co–BaCO3 catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) using CO2 as oxidant. The maximal formation rate of C2H4 was 0.264 mmol · min−1 · (g · cat.)−1 (48.0% C2H6 conversion, 92.2% C2H4 selectivity, 44.3% C2H4 yield) on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst at 650 °C and 6000 ml. (g · cat.)−1. h−1. Co–BaCO3 catalysts were comparatively characterized by XRF, N2 isotherm adsorption-desorption, XRD, H2-TPR and LRs. It was found that Co4+–O species were active sites on these catalysts in ODE with CO2. The redox cycle of Co–O species played an important role on the catalytic performance of Co–BaCO3 catalysts. On the other hand, the co-operation of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 was considered to be one of possible reasons for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.

Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) is one of important processes for producing ethene. However, it is still hard challenge to obtain the high selectivity and yield of ethene in this reaction. ODE using CO2 as oxidant provides an alternative rout for reaching the high selectivity of ethene, because CO2 is expected (1) to eliminate the flammability of reactants, (2) to enhance dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene and reduce over-oxidation of ethene, (3) to maintain the catalytic activity by removing coke forming on catalysts, and (4) to be inexpensive and available in great amount, etc [1–3].
Up to date, a great deal of effort has been made to develop effective catalyst for ODE with CO2, such as supported Cr-oxide catalysts, Ga-based catalysts, Na2WO4–Mn/SiO2 catalysts, CaO–CeO2 catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts, etc [1–22]. Table 1 summarizes the catalytic performance and reaction conditions of topical catalysts for ODE with CO2. In order to obtain better catalytic reactivity, it is highly desirable to develop new catalyst and/or carry out the modification of these catalysts.

In this present work, Co–BaCO3 catalysts have been applied for ODE with CO2. We have found that Co–BaCO3 catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance in the reaction. In order to establish the relation of their catalytic performance with Co species, we have characterized the physicochemical properties of Co–BaCO3 catalysts by XRF, N2 isotherm adsorption-desorption, XRD, H2-TPR and LRs.
Experimental
Catalysts preparation
Co–BaCO3 catalysts with different Co content were prepared by aqueous solution impregnation method. Under constant and quick stirring, BaCO3 powder (Beijing Hongxin Chemical, A.R.) was added to Co(NO3)2 (Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O, Beijing Shuanghuan Chemical, A.R.) aqueous solution. The volume of Co(NO3)2 aqueous solution was ca. 1.5 times more than that of BaCO3 powder. The mixture was evaporated at 90 °C under reduced pressure for 4 h. Subsequently, it was calcined at 350 °C for 3 h and 750 °C for 6 h in air flow.
Catalytic test
Oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 with CO2 was carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. = 10 mm) mounted inside a tube furnace. The space up and down the catalyst bed (0.5 g, 20∼40 mesh) in the reactor was filled with quartz wool to suppress gas-phase homogenous reaction. The catalyst was firstly heated to reaction temperature in CO2 flow, and then exposed to the feed (C2H6/CO2 = 1/3; C2H6: 99.99%; CO2: 99.995%; Beijing Huayuan Gas). The feed and products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Angilent 1490 GC) with TDX-01 column (TCD, Ar carrier, 99.999%) for the separation of H2, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H4 and C2H6. The experimental data were corrected after the reaction for 1 h. Water in the outlet gas was collected by a cold trap (−55 °C). Reactants conversion, products selectivity and products yield were calculated as,
\(\hbox{C}_{2}\hbox{H}_{6} \hbox{ Conversion \%} = (2\hbox{n}_{\rm C_{2}H_{4}}+\hbox{n}_{\rm CH_{4}})/(2\hbox{n}_{\rm C_{2}H_6}+2\hbox{n}_{\rm C_{2}H_{4}}+\hbox{n}_{\rm CH_{4}}\))
\(\hbox{CO}_{2} \hbox{ Conversion \%} = \hbox{n}_{\rm CO}/(\hbox{n}_{\rm CO_{2}}+\hbox{n}_{\rm CO})\)
\(\hbox{C}_{2}\hbox{H}_{4} \hbox{Selectivity \%} = \hbox{n}_{\rm C_{2}H_{4}}/(2\hbox{n}_{\rm C_{2}H_{4}}+\hbox{n}_{\rm CH_{4}})\)
C2H4 Yield % = C2H6 Conversion  ×  C2H4 Selectivity
The conversion of ethane to coke was neglected because the instantaneous formation of coke was dependent on reaction time and difficult to estimate.
Formation rate of ethene (F.R.) and turnover frequency of ethene (TOF) were respectively calculated as,
Formation rate of ethene (mmol · min−1  ·  (g · cat.)−1) = \(\hbox{W}_{\rm C_{2}H_{4}}\)  ×  Ftotal/(g. catalyst)
Turnover frequency of ethene (mol · min−1 · (mol · Co-atom)−1) = \(\hbox{W}_{{\rm C}_{2}{\rm H}_{4}}\)  ×  Ftotal/MCo-atom where \(\hbox{W}_{{\rm C} _{2}{\rm H}_{4}}\) is the concentration of C2H4 in outlet gas obtained by GC analysis (%), Ftotal is the flow rate of feed gas (mol · min−1), and MCo-atom is the amount of Co atoms in the catalyst (mol).
Characterization
Co content (wt%) in Co–BaCO3 catalysts was measured by Rogaku Rotflex 3013 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrument with W target operated at 40 kV and 50 mA.
Specific surface area (SBET) of these catalysts was characterized by N2 isothermal adsorption-desorption method. N2 isothermal adsorption-desorption experiment was performed at the temperature of liquid nitrogen by Micromeritics ASAP400 adsorptionmeter. The catalyst (ca. 240 mg) was degassed at 200 °C and 10−6Torr before the measurement of data.
Bulk structure of these catalysts was identified by Rogaku Rotflex D/Max-C powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15046 nm) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
LR spectrum (LRs) of these catalysts was recorded at room temperature by Renishaw RM1000 confocal microprobe Raman spectrometer equipped with He+/Ne+ laser. The laser was operated at frequency of 514 nm and at a power of 15 mW.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment of these catalysts was carried out by home-built fixed-bed TPR apparatus. The catalyst (ca. 200 mg) was pretreated by 30 ml · min−1 air flow at 750 °C for 1 h, and then purged with 20 ml/min He flow. In H2-TPR experiment, the catalyst was exposed to 5%v H2/N2 flow with a rate of 20 ml · min−1, and heated from r. t. to 850 °C with a rate of 10 °C · min−1. Water was removed from the outlet gas with a cold trap at −85 °C to avoid its interference with TCD detector.
Results and discussion
Catalytic performance
Table 2 lists catalytic performance of Co–BaCO3 catalysts in ODE with CO2 at 650 °C and 6000 ml h−1 · (g · cat.)−1. Firstly, we investigated the gas-phase homogeneous reaction of ethane with CO2 in blank reactor under the reaction conditions. Ethane conversion was 2.4% and CO2 conversion was nearly zero in the blank reactor. When quartz wool was filled in the reactor, ethane conversion further decreased. These results indicate that the homogenous reaction between ethane and CO2 could be negligible under the reaction conditions.

BaCO3 showed 3.2% ethane conversion and 1.5% CO2 conversion, suggesting that BaCO3 had low catalytic activity in ODE with CO2. Comparing with BaCO3, Co–BaCO3 catalysts exhibited distinctively high catalytic activity in the reaction. With the increase of Co content in theses catalysts, ethane conversion and CO2 conversion gradually increased while ethene selectivity decreased. The formation rate of ethene reached the maximum value 0.264 mmol · min−1 · (g · cat.)−1 on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst with the increase of Co content. These results suggest that the presence of Co in Co–BaCO3 catalysts plays great roles on the observed catalytic reactivity of these catalysts.
Effects of space velocity on the catalytic performance of 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst were investigated (figure 1). The smaller space velocity caused the higher conversion of ethane and CO2 as well as the lower selectivity of ethene. In addition, the formation rate of ethene increased with the decrease of space velocity, implying that the desorption and diffusion of ethene from the catalyst affected the catalytic performance of the catalyst.

Catalytic stability of 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst at 650 °C is shown in figure 2. At initial reaction stage (∼ ca. 60 min), ethane conversion slightly decreased while ethene selectivity increased with the increase of time on stream. The phenomenon is due to the formation of coke on the catalyst at the initial reaction stage. Afterwards (60∼300 min), ethane conversion and ethene selectivity were almost stable. The formation rate of ethene was slightly fluctuant in the investigated reaction time. These results demonstrate that 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 exhibited stable catalytic reactivity in ODE with CO2 after the short initial reaction stage.

Characterization
It can be seen in table 2, specific surface area (SBET) of Co–BaCO3 catalysts was lower than that of BaCO3, and it slightly reduced with the increase of Co content. Figure 3 shows XRD patterns of Co–BaCO3 catalysts and reveals the structure and composition of these catalysts. The addition of Co into these catalysts led to the formation of pervoskite BaCoO3 (2θ = 26.2, 29.5, 32.0 and 42.0). Co3O4, Co2O3 and CoO were not detected in these catalysts. These results show that BaCO3 and BaCoO3 were main component in Co–BaCO3 catalysts. On the other hand, \(I_{\rm BaCoO_{3}(101)}/I_{\rm BaCO_{3}(111)}\) ratio is used to roughly express the content of BaCoO3 in these catalysts, where \(I_{\rm BaCoO_{3}(101)}\) and \(I_{\rm BaCO_{3}(111)}\) are respectively the intensity of XRD peak at 2θ = 26.2 and 2θ = 23.9. The content of BaCoO3 was smaller than that of BaCO3 in Co–BaCO3 catalysts, and it gradually increased with Co content increasing (table 3).

Figure 4 presents H2-TPR profiles of Co–BaCO3 catalysts and the results of H2-TPR are summarized in table 3. BaCO3 could not cause the erroneous interpretation of H2-TPR profiles, because BaCO3 decomposes at ca. 920 °C that is above the temperature range of the H2-TPR studies. No reduction peak was detected on BaCO3. Two clear reduction peaks at 410∼450 °C and 550∼580 °C were observed in Co–BaCO3 catalysts; in addition, H2 consumption of the low-temperature reduction peaks (410∼450 °C) was as similar as that of the corresponding high-temperature reduction peaks (550∼580 °C). Pyartuitsky et al. [23] found that SrCoO3 exhibited two H2-TPR reduction peaks at about 477 and 517 °C which were attributed to the reduction of Co4+→Co2+→Co0. Dai et al. [24] detected two reduction peaks at 482 and 800 °C in H2-TPR of SrCoO3-0.401, due to the two reduction steps of Co4+. Therefore, we tentatively assign the two reduction peaks observed in H2-TPR of Co–BaCO3 catalysts to the stepwise reduction of Co4+→Co2+→Co0. In addition, H2 consumption of Co–BaCO3 catalysts gradually increased with the increase of Co content, suggesting that the amount of the reducible Co species increased.

Figure 5 gives LR spectra of BaCO3 and 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst treated under different conditions. BaCO3 appeared Raman bands at 131, 148 and 690 cm−1, which are respectively due to νBa–O (131 and 148 cm−1) [25–27] and the binding in-plane vibration of CO

(690 cm−1) [28–29]. LR spectra of Co3O4, Co2O3 and CoO as references are shown in figure 6. 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst did not appeared the characteristic Raman bands of Co3O4, Co 2O3 and CoO, indicating that there were not Co3O4, Co2 O3 and CoO in the catalyst. Comparing with BaCO3, Co3O4, Co2O3 and CoO, Co–BaCO3 catalysts presented new Raman bands at 600, 376, 219 cm−1, which are assigned to νCo4+–O originating from BaCoO3 [30–31]. H2-TPR peaks of the catalyst probably arise from the reaction of H2 with these Co–O species. It is deduced that oxygen species bonding to Co4+ were removed by ethane and then CO2 oxidized the reduced Con+–O (n < 4) species to Co4+–O species in ODE with CO2.

TOF and apparent activation energy
In order to further investigate the catalytic performance of Co–BaCO3 catalysts, turnover frequency of ethene (TOF) and apparent activation energy of the reaction (Ea) on BaCO3 and 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst were comparatively studied. Figure 7 shows Arrhenius plots for ODE with CO2 on these catalysts. 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst exhibited higher TOF than BaCO3 in the reaction. TOF gradually increased on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst with the increase of the reaction temperature. Ea is ca. 135 kJ · mol−1 on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst while Ea is 192 KJ · mol−1 on BaCO3. Therefore, 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 had higher catalytic reactivity than BaCO3 in ODE with CO2. These results indicate that Co species have important roles on the catalytic reactivity of 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst, which are agreement with those results of catalytic test.

These above results demonstrate that the presence of Co species modifies the properties of Co–BaCO3 catalyst which in turn determines the catalytic performance of these catalysts. Highly reactive 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalysts had the reducible Co4+–O species (BaCoO3), which proceeded redox cycle with ethane and CO2 in ODE with CO2. In contrast, BaCO3 did not show any H2 reduction peaks and it was almost inactive in ODE with CO2. The difference in the activation energy suggests that active sites and reaction pathways on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst are different from those on BaCO3. These findings indicate that catalytic reactivity of Co–BaCO3 catalysts is close associated with the presence of Co4+–O species. These reducible Co4+–O species are main active sites for ODE with CO2, and oxidative dehydrogenation is major reaction pathway on Co–BaCO3 catalysts in the reaction. The high redox property of Co–BaCO3 catalysts favors conversion of ethane and CO2 in the reaction, however, the much stronger redox property of these catalysts results in the deep oxidation of ethene. The characterization results demonstrate that the redox property of Co–BaCO3 catalyst became stronger and stronger with the increase of Co content. Thus, ethane conversion and CO2 conversion increased while ethene selectivity decreased on Co–BaCO3 catalyst as Co content increasing.
On the other hand, Dang et al. [32–33] and Au et al. [34–36] found that BaCO3 enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalysts in oxidation dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidative coupling of methane. For example, Dang et al. [33] reported that V-BaCO3 catalysts showed high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene, due to the co-operation of BaCO3 and Ba3(VO4)2. Au et al. [34] found that BaCO3 promoted the catalytic activity of BaCO3/LaOBr catalyst in oxidative coupling of methane. The addition of BaCO3 into the catalyst readily formed defects centers and trapped electrons on the catalyst, which enhanced the formation of active oxygen species. In the case of Co–BaCO3 catalysts, the catalysts were composed of BaCO3 and BaCoO3. Therefore, the co-operation of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 is one of possible reasons for the high catalytic performance of Co–BaCO3 catalysts in ODE with CO2.
Conclusion
Co–BaCO3 catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance in ODE with CO2. The maximal formation rate of C2H4 was 0.264 mmol · min−1 · (g · cat.)−1 (48.0% C2H6 conversion, 92.2% C2H4 selectivity, 44.3% C2H4 yield) on 7 wt% Co–BaCO3 catalyst at 650 °C and 6000 ml · (g · cat)−1 · h−1. The presence of Co–O species modified the properties of Co–BaCO3 catalysts, which in turn determined the catalytic performance of these catalysts in ODE with CO2. Co4+–O species are main active sites on Co–BaCO3 catalysts in the reaction. The redox cycle of Co–O species plays great roles on the catalytic performance of Co–BaCO3 catalysts. On the other hand, the co-operation of BaCO3 and BaCoO3 is one of possible reasons for the high catalytic activity of these catalysts.
