How do various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the key challenges and trade-offs in optimizing their overall performance?

1.The document does not provide information on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over a Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in the presence of CO2. It does discuss the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of ethane over a Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst, showing that the initial activity of the catalyst was greatly enhanced by introducing CO2. The stability of the catalysts was also greatly improved after the addition of CO2. However, it does not provide information on chromium oxide catalysts or the CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

1.该文件没有提供各种支撑材料(如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2)和反应条件(包括CO2分压)如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机理途径的信息。该文件主要关注在CO2存在下Ga2O3/HZSM-5催化剂上乙烷脱氢生成乙烯的过程。它确实讨论了CO2分压对Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)催化剂上乙烷脱氢的影响,表明引入CO2后催化剂的初始活性大大提高。添加CO2后,催化剂的稳定性也大大提高。然而,它没有提供关于铬氧化物催化剂或CO2氧化脱氢反应的信息。

The stability of the catalyst was greatly improved after the addition of CO2, attributed to the suppression of coke formation.

The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over a Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in the presence of CO2. It does discuss the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst, showing that the initial activity of the catalyst was greatly enhanced by introducing CO2. The initial ethane conversion increases quickly with raising the CO2/C2H6 ratio until it reaches its peak, and then it decreases with further increase in the CO2/C2H6 ratio. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O. Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The stability of the catalysts was greatly improved after the addition of CO2. The improvement of stability can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation coming from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and promotion of desorption of ethylene from the catalyst surface.
