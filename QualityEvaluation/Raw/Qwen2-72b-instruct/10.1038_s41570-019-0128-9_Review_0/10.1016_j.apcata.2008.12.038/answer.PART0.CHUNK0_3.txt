1.The document does not provide information on how various support materials (such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2) and reaction conditions (including CO2 partial pressure) influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over a Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in the presence of CO2. It does discuss the effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst, showing that the initial activity of the catalyst was greatly enhanced by introducing CO2. The initial ethane conversion increases quickly with raising the CO2/C2H6 ratio until it reaches its peak, and then it decreases with further increase in the CO2/C2H6 ratio. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O. Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The stability of the catalysts was greatly improved after the addition of CO2. The improvement of stability can be attributed to the suppression of coke formation coming from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and promotion of desorption of ethylene from the catalyst surface.

1.文档没有提供各种支撑材料(如SiO2、MCM-41、H-ZSM-5、Al2O3、ZrO2和CeO2)和反应条件(包括CO2分压)如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制途径的信息。文献主要关注在CO2存在下Ga2O3/HZSM-5催化剂对乙烷脱氢至乙烯的影响。确实讨论了CO2分压对Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)催化剂乙烷脱氢的影响，表明引入CO2后催化剂的初始活性大大提高。随着CO2/C2H6比的提高，初始乙烷转化率迅速增加，直到达到峰值，然后随着CO2/C2H6比的进一步增加而下降。二氧化碳对反应的促进作用可归因于逆向水煤气变换反应，该反应通过将H2与CO2转化为CO和H2O加速脱氢产物的形成。同时，CO2通过置换吸附在催化剂表面的乙烷对反应有负面影响。加入CO2后，催化剂的稳定性大大提高。稳定性的提高可归因于两个方面对焦炭形成的抑制：通过Boudouard反应消除焦炭和促进乙烯从催化剂表面解吸。
