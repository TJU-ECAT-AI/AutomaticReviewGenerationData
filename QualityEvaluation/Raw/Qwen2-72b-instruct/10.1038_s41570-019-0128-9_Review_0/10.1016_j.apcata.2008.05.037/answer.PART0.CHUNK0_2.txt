1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with SiO2 being the most promising. The features of supported chromium species have been assessed by DR UVvis spectroscopy to get insights into their structure-function relationships. The addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy demand of the endothermic process and results in decreased coke formation, leading to increased catalyst stability. The introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased.

1.文献没有提供各种支撑材料如SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, 和CeO2如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，最好的性能是在各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上支持的铬上获得的，其中SiO2是最有前景的。通过DR UVvis光谱学评估了支撑的铬物种的特征，以了解其结构-功能关系。添加少量氧气降低了吸热过程的能量需求，并导致焦炭形成减少，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。在反应混合物中引入氧气至5.0 vol.%导致催化剂活性和稳定性的显著增加。丙烯和异丁烯的选择性略有下降，但由于对较轻烯烃的选择性增加，总烯烃选择性增加。
