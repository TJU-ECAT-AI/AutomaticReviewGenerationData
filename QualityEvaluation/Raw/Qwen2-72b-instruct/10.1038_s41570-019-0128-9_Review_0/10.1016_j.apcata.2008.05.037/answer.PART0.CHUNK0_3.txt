1.The literature does not provide specific information on how various support materials such as SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, and CeO2 influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanistic pathways of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that the best performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 in the presence of CO2 has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, with the most promising results for SiO2 and diamond loaded with 1.7-8.0 wt% Cr. The literature also does not provide detailed information on the influence of CO2 partial pressure on these factors, but it does state that the addition of CO2 to the feed in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes results in a decrease of energy demand and coke formation, leading to increased catalyst stability.

1.文献没有提供各种支撑材料如SiO2, MCM-41, H-ZSM-5, Al2O3, ZrO2, 和CeO2如何影响铬氧化物催化剂在CO2氧化脱氢反应中的活性、选择性、稳定性和机制路径的具体信息。但是，它确实提到在CO2存在下C2C4氧化脱氢的最佳性能是通过在各种氧化物、沸石、活性炭和金刚石上支撑铬获得的，其中SiO2和金刚石负载1.7-8.0 wt% Cr的结果最有希望。文献也没有提供CO2分压对这些因素影响的详细信息，但它确实指出，在轻烷氧化脱氢中添加CO2会导致能量需求和焦炭形成减少，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。
