Studies on Dehydrogenation of Ethane in the Presence of CO2 over Octahedral Molecular Sieve (OMS-2) Catalysts Graphical Abstract A breath of fresh air: The octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in the dehydrogenation of ethane into ethylene in the presence of CO2. This process can be extended for other alkanes, giving an ideal feedstock for any process involving alkene carbonylation, as a greenhouse gas, CO2, can be recycled.
Carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, can be used as a source of carbon. Conversion of CO2 into organic compounds has been studied intensively. For example, ethane catalytic dehydrogenation [Equation(1)] offers an attractive route for converting CO2. Firstly, the coke-formation problem, particularly troublesome in the steam-cracking industry,1 can be solved by treating the coke with CO2 to generate CO over the catalyst.2 In addition, CO2 can act as a medium for supplying heat to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.3,4 Furthermore, the products from Equation(1), C2H4 and CO, are precursors for olefin/CO copolymerization reactions. By varying the feedstock ratio (C2H6/CO2) in the reaction, different ratios of the products (C2H4/CO) can easily be obtained for the specific copolymerization process. Hence, the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is an ideal feedstock for any process involving ethylene carbonylation with an additional benefit of recycling the greenhouse gas.
((1)) Despite these advantages, catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 is still not fully developed. Chromium oxide on supports have proven to be the most effective catalysts for this reaction.47 However, chromium-based catalysts overconvert most of the ethane feedstock to other unwanted byproducts, such as methane and carbon dioxide, which decreases the selectivities for ethylene when high temperatures (>700C) for high conversions of ethane (>70%) are used. When chromium oxide-based catalysts were used, CO2 was barely converted (<20%). Chromium oxide-based catalysts are also unstable, expensive, and have a short lifetime (i.e., they deactivate after a few hours). Therefore, the challenge still remains in designing efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalysts that could lead to high ethane conversion (>70%), high CO2 conversion (>50%), and ultimately high ethylene selectivities (>80%).Cryptomelane-type manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2) have been applied extensively as catalysts.816 The OMS-2 structure consists of one-dimensional tunnels built by 2×2 edge- and corner-sharing MnO6 octahedral chains, forming infinite 3D frameworks with molecule-sized (4.6×4.6Å) tunnels.1719 OMS-2 is a mixed-valent material2022 with manganese in oxidation states of Mn4+, Mn3+, and Mn2+. The mixed valency of OMS-2, along with its one-dimensional tunnel structure, gives rise to interesting oxidation properties.17,23,24 OMS-2 materials have been synthesized by different synthetic methods and characterized.2529 In comparison to chromium oxide catalysts, OMS-2 materials are also inexpensive, easy to make, and have received a great deal of attention due to their catalytic properties.30,31 Herein, we report the study of the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 using OMS-2 as an efficient, stable, and inexpensive catalyst. High conversion of ethane (up to 87%) and promising selectivities towards ethylene (up to 97%), along with high CO2 conversions (up to 56%) were obtained under the reaction conditions involving a short contact time (0.6s). This is the first example of using an octahedral molecular sieve as an effective catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) has been used to show the existence of acidic (NH3-TPD) and basic (CO2-TPD) sites on the OMS-2 catalysts.26 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the cryptomelane OMS-2 structure (see the Supporting Information, Figure4). Results of the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) showed that the synthetic OMS-2 is stable to 850C (see the Supporting Information, Figure5). Our earlier studies26 of pore-size distribution indicated that a broad range of micropores was present, with diameters ranging from 58Å. The average oxidation state (AOS) of manganese was 3.67, suggesting that within OMS-2, Mn4+ is the dominant oxidation state. All of these properties contribute to the catalytic performance of the synthesized OMS-2.The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was used to measure the activity of the Mn species. The TPR profile of the OMS-2 catalyst (see the Supporting Information, Figure1), exhibits two pronounced H2-consumption peaks in the temperature range of 250550C. The first H2-consumption peak at around 280C can be assigned to the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3 and the large H2-consumption peak is the result of overlapping peaks representing the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3, Mn2O3 to Mn3O4, and Mn3O4 to MnO.32,33 Moreover, the colors of the catalyst were different. OMS-2 was a dark brown color after pretreatment in He but changed to brown and green after TPR analysis. The greenish powder was assigned to the MnII species in manganosite-type manganese oxide (MnO) by XRD.The catalyst activity was evaluated with a short contact time (0.6s). OMS-2 gave outstanding conversions (Table1) of C2H6 (70%) and CO2 (50%), as well as high C2H4 selectivities (88%) at high temperatures (800C), whereas the Cr2O3 (5wt.%) loaded ZSM-5 catalyst2 only gave 44% selectivity to ethylene with less than 20% CO2 conversion. By using OMS-2 as the catalyst, conversions of C2H6 increased from 35% to 70% and conversions of CO2 increased from 31% to 50% when the reaction temperature was raised from 750C to 800C. These results suggest that OMS-2 is an excellent catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 with recycling of the greenhouse gas as an added benefit.Table 1.

Carbon deposition on the catalyst surface is one of the major reasons for its deactivation. Herein, we discuss the effect of CO2 on carbon deposition. Figure1 shows the results from the combustion of carbon on the OMS-2 catalyst. The profile of the MS signal (m/z=44) before CO2 treatment indicates the formation of carbon on the catalyst by ethane treatment at 700C. However, the carbon combustion peak decreased considerably by CO2 treatment at 800C. Results obtained from temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) indicate that utilization of carbon dioxide in ethane catalytic dehydrogenation can resolve the coke formation problem by removing the coke over the OMS-2 catalyst, while maintaining the activity of the catalyst. Another possibility is that CO2 can block the sites for carbon formation during the reaction process, but is unlikely at the high reaction temperatures (800C). It is more likely that in the presence of the catalyst, CO2 is more active and removes carbon.

Catalyst stability is important in the presence of CO2 and often determines the fate of a catalytic material for potential industrial applications. Herein, the stability of the OMS-2 was investigated by continuously recording the catalytic performance for 24h online under constant reaction conditions (T=800C). Results showed high stability of the catalytic material, in which ethane and carbon dioxide conversions along with ethylene selectivities were maintained throughout the entire experiment time (see the Supporting Information, Figure3). However, the structure of the catalyst was changed to manganosite-type manganese oxide (MnO) as established by XRD measurements (see the Supporting Information Figure6c), which may be due to the lack of oxygen during the reaction. After regeneration of the used catalyst (after 24h reaction) in O2 flow at 800C for 2h, OMS-2 structure reformed (see the Supporting Information, Figure6d) and the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalyst remained (Table2, entry6), indicating that the active catalyst is an oxygen-deficient OMS-2 material. Structural investigations are ongoing.

The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons involves the removal of hydrogen and the suppression of carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear. Carbon dioxide could react directly with hydrogen through the watergas shift reaction (CO+H2O) or could act as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation. To determine which of the pathways predominates, studies were carried out by varying CO2 concentrations while keeping the concentration of C2H6 constant (Table2). The ethane conversion remained almost constant, which suggests that CO2 did not participate directly in the dehydrogenation. We postulate that two reactions take place [Equations(2) and(3)]:((2)) ((3)) Ethylene and H2, products of Equation(2), and CO and H2O, products of Equation(3), are all detected in the reaction effluent. Equation(1) describes the net reaction.
The kinetic studies were performed at different residence times (see the Supporting Information, Figure2) by varying total flow rates while keeping the ratio of N2/C2H6/CO2 constant. A linear relationship with a correlation factor of R2=0.99 was obtained, which is described by Equation(4):((4)) where k1=147.4mLmmol1s1, attributed to a second-order reaction described by the following rate (r) equation:((5)) Carbon dioxide was then converted [Equation(3)] either on the surface or in the tunnels of the catalyst by reducing CO2 with H2 generated from Equation(2) and by releasing water (reverse watergas shift reaction, RWGS), making the reaction in Equation(1) possible.
The suppression of the reaction of coke with CO2 [Equation(6)] was confirmed by TPO analysis (Figure1).
((6)) CO2 removed carbon and produced CO (Table1) in the presence of the OMS-2 catalyst. In contrast, carbon deposited on quartz chips was also tested by TPO analysis. Only a small amount of carbon was removed by CO2. These results suggest that with the OMS-2 catalyst, carbon could easily be removed by CO2, which indicate that the activity of the catalyst can be maintained over a long time by removing the coke formed on the catalyst. After a 24 h stable period of activity, the catalyst was analyzed by the TPO method, and very little carbon accumulation on the catalysts was detected (Figure1).The main byproduct, methane, was most likely generated from the hydrocracking reaction of ethane [Equation(7)]. High selectivity to a particular nonequilibrium product is usually only obtained at low temperatures (<500C) in order to focus on a reaction along a particular reaction path, and this selectivity usually occurs at low reactant conversion (<50%).1 High temperatures, such as 800C, usually generate many products because entropy effects open up many reaction channels. However, in this case we detected >85% ethylene selectivity and <5% CH4 on the OMS-2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 [Equation(7)]. ((7)) Therefore, this system may be focused on the reaction path almost exclusively generating C2H4 and H2. The attack of ethane by H2 to cause CC scission is strongly suppressed because the process involves the RWGS reaction catalyzed by the OMS-2 catalyst and removes H2, which results in high selectivities (88%) to ethylene.Slightly increased ethane conversion (78%) was obtained by using Fe-OMS-2 prepared by ion exchange of Fe3+ in the tunnels (Table1, entry4). However, the active sites of OMS-2 may still be derived on the outside of the particles due to the phase transformation of the material. A redox mechanism is considered to involve the reverse watergas shift reaction under the influence of recycling the oxidation states [MnIV/MnIII, MnII] (see the Supporting Information, Scheme2). The formation of carbon dioxidemanganese complexes may produce activated oxygen.In an effort to improve the yield of ethylene, Fe and Mo ions were loaded on the OMS-2 by an incipient wetness impreg- nation (IWI) method. The Mo and Fe ion-loaded materials enhanced the conversion of ethane (>86%) and C2H4 yield (66%) under the same conditions (Table1, entries56). The C2H4 yield (66%) is the highest reported in the literature, which suggests that inexpensive OMS-2 could also be used as an active and selective catalytic support for olefin dehydrogenation. Potentially higher conversions and selectivities could be obtained by using expensive zeolites, which are mainly used in industry as catalytic supports.In summary, using OMS-2 as the catalyst in C2H6 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, is an example where extreme conditions are used to drive high conversions of ethane (>70%) and CO2 (up to 56%) with high selectivity towards ethylene (87%) with a short contact time (0.6s). The reaction pathway involved two steps: ethane catalytic dehydrogenation and a reverse watergas shift reaction. High ethylene yields (66%) were obtained and could be improved by using OMS-2 as an active support. This inexpensive material also showed high stability during the process, and the presence of CO2 removed coke depositions throughout the catalyst. Such impressive activity, selectivity, and stability open up new possibilities for olefin dehydrogenations in the presence of CO2, a perfect feedstock for any process involving ethylene carbonylation with the recycling of the greenhouse gas.Experimental Section Synthesis of thermally stable manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieves (OMS-2): OMS-2 was prepared by calcining layered structure birnessite at 800C for 2h.26 The layered structure birnessite was prepared using an air-oxidation method. MnCl24H2O (7.5g, 37.9mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (50mL). Air was bubbled into the Mn2+ solution at a flow rate of 16Lmin1. An aqueous solution (80mL) containing NaOH (20g, 500mmol) was then added dropwise into the solution for 30min. After 6h, the product was filtered, washed, and transferred into a 1M aqueous solution of KCl (250mL) for ion exchange at room temperature with stirring for 12h. The product was then filtered and washed with deionized water (3×1L). The K-birnessite was dried in air at 80C for 4h and then placed in a furnace to calcine stepwise in air at 200, 400, 600, and 800C for 2h at each temperature.Catalytic reactions: All measurements were performed in a con- tinuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d.=10mm) mounted inside a tube furnace (see the Supporting Information, Scheme1). The reactor consisted of three gases: N2 (UHP 99.999%, Airgas), CO2 (Instrument Grade 99.5%, Airgas), and C2H6 (Instrument Grade 99.5%, Airgas). The gas flows were controlled by Brooks 5850E series mass flow controllers equipped with a Brooks 0145 4-channel readout. Gases were fed into a three-zone thermocraft tube furnace controlled by Watlow temperature controllers. The dead volume of the catalyst bed (2mL) in the reactor was filled with quartz chips to support a gas-phase homogenous mixture and heated. The reactor was purged with N2 for 15min to remove all of the air from the system before the temperature was started. Once the furnace was equilibrated at the operating temperature, reactant gases were introduced into the reactor. The reactants and products were analyzed with an online gas chromatograph (SRI 8610C, TCD, He (UHP 99.999%, Airgas) carrier) with a packed silica gel and a molecular sieve column for the separation of H2, CH4, CO, CO2, C2H4, and C2H6. The gas chromatograph was calibrated with a gas mixture from Airgas XC030323B containing 10mol% of CO2, CO, C2H6, C2H4, H2, CH4, C3H6, and C3H6, and 20mol% of N2.
