[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
[2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."
[3] "In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
[4] "These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
[5] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
[6] "When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
[7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."

1.The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the gallium hydride species, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Bronsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange upon reduction continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. These observations suggest that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is consistent with the absence of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx, indicating that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species. The intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite when Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), further supporting the connection between framework Al pairs and GaHx species.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，代表镓氢化物物种的GaHx带的强度最初随Ga/Al比的增加而增加，在Ga/Al比为0.1时达到稳定，然后在Ga/Al比超过0.56时下降。这种趋势在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上是相似的，但最大强度较低。Ga交换在还原过程中对Bronsted酸位点(BAS)的消耗在两种样品中Ga/Al比超过0.7时才停止。这些观察结果表明，并非所有Ga的阳离子物种在还原时都能形成Ga氢化物，这与Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上没有GaHx是一致的。框架Al对密度和GaHx量之间存在线性相关性，表明GaHx的前体可能是二价阳离子物种。当Ga被支撑在(部分)Co2+交换的H-ZSM-5 (15)上时，GaHx带的强度与沸石中交换的Co2+量成反比，进一步支持了框架Al对和GaHx物种之间的联系。
