[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
[2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."
[3] "In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
[4] "These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
[5] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
[6] "When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
[7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."

1.The intensity of the GaHx band, which is associated with gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange upon reduction continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. These diverging trends indicate that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is consistent with the absence of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx, as evidenced by the ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+. The intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite when Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15). The precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species, as only framework Al pairs can stabilize such species.

1.在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，与镓氢化物相关的GaHx带的强度最初随Ga/Al比的增加而增加，在Ga/Al比为0.1时达到稳定，然后在Ga/Al比超过0.56时下降。这种趋势在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上是相似的，但GaHx带的最大强度较低。通过还原，Ga交换消耗的Bronsted酸位点(BAS)在两种样品中直到Ga/Al比超过0.7才停止。这些不同的趋势表明，并非所有Ga的阳离子物种在还原时都能形成Ga氢化物，这与Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上没有GaHx相一致。GaHx峰的最大积分面积与Co2+对应的UVvis带之间的比率显示了框架Al对密度和GaHx量之间的线性相关性。当Ga被支撑在(部分)Co2+交换的H-ZSM-5 (15)上时，GaHx带的强度与交换在沸石中的Co2+量成反比。GaHx的前体很可能是一个二价阳离子物种，因为只有框架Al对才能稳定这种物种。
