Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the exis-
tence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the
enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a
reduction in selectivity for the target product. Herein, we describe an approach to breaking
the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by
assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene
selectivity and propane conversion. We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper
SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum
ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the
desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting
in high propylene selectivity (~90%). Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low
temperatures (<400 °C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of
operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 °C.

T
he development of new catalysts with simultaneously
enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal
of researchers. In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of
new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle. It
indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates
with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to
surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reac-
tants1. The principle behind this phenomenon can be attributed
to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on
transition metal surfaces2, and various linear scaling relationships
have been developed which connect the reaction energy/barriers
with binding energy of representative surface species, i.e.,
descriptors. Therefore, the complicated reaction kinetics can be
described by only a few descriptors, which enables fast screening
of potential catalytic materials with the help of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations3.
However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the
enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently
accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the
reduced selectivity4. Considering the speciﬁc case of propane
dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the pro-
duction of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as
PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10. Our previous DFT
calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM
alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which
normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene
accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehy-
drogenation of propane11. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a
catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the
improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12.
Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new
frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis13. A large number of single-
atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit distinct and often outstanding
performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions, such as CO
oxidation14,15, water-gas shift reaction (WGS)16–18, methanol
steam
reforming
(MSR)19,20,

reaction
(HER)21–23,
hydrogenation
of
substituted
nitroarenes24,25,
hydrogenation of alkynes and dienes26–29, and hydrogenation of
carbon dioxide30–32. However, SACs do not ﬁnd broad applica-
tion in high temperature (> 500 °C) light alkane dehydrogenation
reactions. Although single-site Zn(II)33, Co(III)34, Ni(II)35, and
Ga(III)36 on silica have been developed as selective PDH catalysts,
these active sites suffer from low activity compared to metallic
sites. To the best of our knowledge, high stability and selectivity
have not been achieved for the PDH reaction with the use of
single-atom Pt catalysts.
Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks
the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great
improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic
dehydrogenation activity. Based on the theoretical analysis, we
design and synthesize the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on
γ-alumina via an atomic dilution method and conﬁrm the for-
mation of Pt/Cu SAA through detailed characterizations, such as
CO-diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy
(CO-DRIFTS), aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-
ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-
STEM) and extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS)
spectra. Subsequent catalytic tests demonstrate the transferability
from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reaction and the Pt/
Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays
propylene selectivity of ~90% with the high formation rate of
10.6 mol g−1Pt h−1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure,
520 °C, WHSV = 4 h−1, C3H8/N2 = 1/1. Unlike previous repor-
ted low temperature SAA applications26,29,37–39, our synthesized
Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on stream
at 520 °C.
Results
Theoretical prediction. Previous studies have shown that the
alkane dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of
the Pt particles, because single atoms of Pt are capable of cata-
lyzing the reaction40. However, undesired side reactions that
occur during the alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis,
isomerization and coke formation, are structure sensitive reac-
tions, requiring more than one Pt atom41. Therefore, isolated Pt
atoms are expected to be a potential active center with high
propylene selectivity. It is worth noting that noble metals are
active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state41. Xiong et al.
reported that single Pt atoms on CeO2 can only promote the
cleavage of C–C bonds of hydrocarbons with no observed selec-
tivity toward dehydrogenation42. Therefore, SAAs attract our
attention, where the catalytically active metal is atomically dis-
persed in the surface layer of the more inert host metal and exists
in the metallic state, distinguishing from single atoms positively
charged on metal oxides26,43. Such SAAs have been widely used
as a strategy for selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the
selective
hydrogenation
of
styrene,
acetylene,
and
1,3-
butadiene26,29. Recently, Pt/Cu SAAs were suggested as an
approach to coke-resistant C–H activation chemistry and exam-
ined in the systems of methyl groups, methane, butane, and
propane37. However, no stable SAA under reducing environment
at high temperatures (>400 °C) has been reported so far. This
raises the question whether SAAs are capable of breaking the
restriction of the scaling relationship for PtM alloys and cata-
lyzing dehydrogenation reactions at high temperatures stably.
As shown in previous theoretical studies, the PDH activity can
be described by the ﬁrst dehydrogenation barrier which is the
rate-determining step, and the selectivity was estimated by the
difference between di-σ propene desorption barrier and its further
dehydrogenation barrier (the highest barrier for di-σ propene
dehydrogenation to C3H4 shown in Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Figure 1)11. Due to the existence of the scaling relationship for
Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals), low dehydrogenation
barrier (i.e., high PDH activity) accompanies with strong C–Pt
interaction, leading to strong propene adsorption (i.e., low
propene selectivity) (Fig. 1a). However, isolated Pt atoms
dispersed in Cu nanoparticles maintain a reasonable dehydro-
genation activation barrier and at the same time display a quite
high selectivity, which is reﬂected by the low binding strength of
propylene and high deep dehydrogenation barrier (Fig. 1a). Our
DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM
alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for
conventional Pt alloys during the PDH (Fig. 1b). Unlike over Pt
surfaces, the isolated Pt atom in Pt/Cu SAA can only interact with
a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model
precursor of coke formation, instead of more stable three Pt–C
interactions on threefold hollow site over Pt(111) (Fig. 1c). The
deep dehydrogenation thus becomes strongly endothermic over
Pt/Cu SAA with a signiﬁcant free energy barrier (>2 eV),
compared with the same step over Pt(111) with a surmountable
barrier (<1 eV), leading to a much higher propylene selectivity
over Pt/Cu SAA (Fig. 1d). The binding strength of π adsorbed
propylene over Pt/Cu SAA (−0.57 eV) is also weaker than the di-
σ ones over Pt3Cu(111) (−0.88 eV) and Pt(111) (−1.10 eV),
further

(Supplementary Table 1). However, for the ﬁrst two dehydro-
genation steps, the geometry effects mentioned above are less
apparent, due to no binding mode change for propyl over our
calculated surfaces. Therefore, the destabilization of dehydroge-
nated intermediates over Pt/Cu SAA is less obvious than C3H5
(Fig. 1c). This is also important for Pt/Cu SAA to maintain
reasonably low dehydrogenation barriers for the ﬁrst two
dehydrogenation steps. Compared with Pt(111), Pt/Cu SAA only

slightly increases the corresponding dehydrogenation barriers by
~0.4 eV, resulting in similar PDH activity over pure Pt and Pt/Cu
SAA (Fig. 1d). Note that our convergence test suggests Pt/Cu
(111) surface model can well describe Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles
which are larger than 2.1 nm in diameter (Pt/Cu404, Supplemen-
tary Figure 2). Similar behavior has also been observed for single
Pt atom over Cu(100) and Cu(211) surfaces (Supplementary
Figure 3).
DFT results also identify that the exposed isolated surface Pt
atoms within Cu(111) facets of Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles (larger
than 2.1 nm in diameter) are thermodynamically more stable
than other types of Pt species: (1) isolated subsurface Pt atoms,
(2) single Pt atoms within Cu(100) facets, (3) single Pt atoms at
low coordinated step edge and corner sites, and (4) surface dimers
within Cu(111) (Supplementary Tables 2–4). Therefore, isolated
Pt atoms within Cu(111) facets are thermodynamically preferred
in the case with high Cu to Pt molar ratio, which maximizes the
utilization of Pt atoms.
Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the catalysts based
on Pt/Cu SAA have the potential to achieve a decent catalytic
performance for PDH. Note that we also calculated the relative
stability of Pt/Ag SAA surfaces, and the single Pt atom is always
slightly more stable at subsurface instead of surface. Although the
dehydrogenation barrier is similar for Pt/Cu(111) and Pt/Ag(111)
SAA surfaces (Supplementary Figure 4), the catalytic activity for
Pt/Ag(111) might be low due to the less exposed surface Pt atoms
over Ag.
Preparation of Pt/Cu SAA via atomic dilution. We simply
synthesized the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina
by means of atomic dilution. Only diffraction lines due to γ-
alumina were detected in the XRD patterns of the catalysts after
calcination (Supplementary Figure 5a), suggesting Cu oxide
species are highly dispersed on the surface of alumina. When
treated under H2-rich condition at 600 °C for 1 h, the oxide
species of Pt and Cu on γ-alumina can be fully reduced since the
highest reduction peak temperature for PtCu bimetallic catalysts
is below 200 °C (Supplementary Figure 6). For the catalysts after
reduction, the diffraction line of Cu(111) becomes apparent as the
content of Cu increases to 6.7 wt%, demonstrating the formation
of Cu nanoparticles on alumina (Supplementary Figure 5b).
Given the appearance of the co-reduction peaks (Supplementary
Figure 6), the close contact between Cu oxide species and Pt oxide
species
leads to preferential formation of PtCu bimetallic
nanoparticles rather than two metal phases apart from each other
during reduction. The PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles formed on
γ-Al2O3 during reduction in the H2-rich atmosphere at high
temperatures can be considered as a Pt/Cu surface alloy, as Pt is
preferentially dispersed on the surface layer of PtCu alloys29,44.

Then with the amount of Pt ﬁxed, further addition of Cu lowers
the concentration of Pt in the Pt/Cu surface alloy leading to easier
formation of Pt/Cu SAA. It can be expected that Pt atoms would
be individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles if diluted to a cer-
tain degree and the structure would stay the same with further
dilution.
To verify the above conjecture, we compared the initial
activities of the catalysts with ﬁxed amount of Pt (0.1 wt%) but
various contents of Cu (Fig. 2a). As expected, the initial
conversion of propane increases until the content of Cu reaches
6.7 wt% and then remains unchanged with the amount of Cu
further increasing to 15 wt%. Hence, we presume that the
formation of Pt/Cu SAA on γ-alumina can be achieved for the
catalysts with the addition of Cu no less than 6.7 wt%.
Furthermore, given the assumption that Pt atoms are individually
dispersed in Cu nanoparticles for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, keeping the
content of Cu (10 wt%) unchanged, we decreased progressively
the amount of Pt from 0.1 wt% to 0.025 wt%, which guarantees
the structure unchanged. The initial activity correlates linearly
with the Pt content, which again suggests the formation of Pt/Cu
SAA (Fig. 2b). Note that the intersection of the ﬁtting line with Y-
axis is not zero, which is attributed to the weak catalytic ability of
γ-alumina-supported Cu.
Formation of Pt/Cu SAA. The structure of Pt/Cu SAA supported
on γ-alumina was conﬁrmed by CO-DRIFTS, AC-HAADF-STEM
images and EXAFS spectra. As shown in the in situ DRIFTS, the
weak bands caused by bridge-adsorbed CO on two adjacent Pt
atoms
appear
at
around
1835 cm−1
for
0.1Pt/Al2O3
and
0.1Pt0.1Cu/Al2O3 (Supplementary Figure 7a, b), indicating the
existence of dimers or clusters of Pt45. Meanwhile, the lack of the
band of bridge-bonded CO on other catalysts suggests the exclu-
sively isolated Pt atoms or low concentrations of bridging CO46,47.
For 0.1Pt/Al2O3, Fig. 3a shows a main band at 2068 cm−1, which
can be assigned as linearly adsorbed CO on Pt nanoparticles. For
CO adsorption on 0.1Pt0.1Cu/Al2O3, 0.1Pt0.3Cu/Al2O3, and
0.1Pt3Cu/Al2O3, the bands due to linearly bonded CO on Pt
ensembles on PtCu bimetallic nanoparticles appear at 2063–2044
cm−1 (Fig. 3b–d). The unique band centered at 2018 cm−1
emerges in the spectra of 0.1Pt3Cu/Al2O3, 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3, and
0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. 3d–f), which can be attributed to linearly
bonded CO on single atoms of Pt in the metallic state48, differing
from those at 2080–2115 cm−1 ascribed to CO linearly adsorbed
on Ptδ+ single-atom sites on metal oxides45,49–51. Note that our
DFT calculations predict the top-adsorbed CO stretching fre-
quencies are 2061 cm−1 over Pt(111) and 2021 cm−1 over Pt/Cu
SAA, which are very close to experimentally observed locations
(Supplementary Table 5). Combining the fact that there are no
bands due to CO on Pt ensembles detected for 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3
and 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, it can be inferred that Pt atoms on the
surface of Cu nanoparticles are individually dispersed. It is worth
pointing out that the variation trend of CO adsorption behavior is
highly consistent with that of the initial activities of the catalysts as
the Cu content increases.
The structure of Pt/Cu SAA was further addressed by AC-
HAADF-STEM images. Single Pt atoms can be distinguished
from Cu atoms due to differences in the Z-contrast29,52. Figure 4a
indicates the presence of individual brighter Pt atoms in Cu
nanoparticles. As a contrast, we failed to ﬁnd Pt atoms over the
10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Figure 11). The
lattice spacing of Pt/Cu SAA is 0.21 nm, which is in good
consistence with the lattice spacing of Cu(111), indicating dilute
dispersion of Pt atoms in Cu nanoparticles. Single Pt atoms in Cu
nanoparticles are repeatedly observed in different regions of the
reduced 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, and no clusters or nanopar-
ticles of Pt on γ-alumina are found (Supplementary Figures 9, 10,
and
23).
In
terms
of
0.1Pt/Al2O3,
the
Pt
nanoparticles
are dispersed on γ-alumina with an average particle size of about
2.3 nm (Supplementary Figure 8). In situ EXAFS performed at the
Pt–LIII edge and Cu–K edge reveals the coordination of Pt and Cu
in monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtCu catalysts (Supplementary
Figures 12–19 and Table 7). At the Pt-LIII edge, there are ∼6.8
Pt–Cu bonds at 2.53 Å and no Pt–Pt coordination is detected in
the fully reduced 0.1Pt6.7Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, providing direct
evidence for the isolated Pt atoms in the bimetallic PtCu catalysts
at high Cu to Pt molar ratios. Due to the low Pt loading, at the
Cu–K edge, there are only 7.0 Cu–Cu bonds at 2.55 Å consistent
with 2 nm metallic Cu nanoparticles. For the 0.1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst,
the existence of Pt–Pt coordination indicates the formation of Pt
islands and/or clusters.

compare their intrinsic ability to activate the C–H bonds of
propane53,54. The C–H activation starts at about 188 °C on Pt
nanoparticles, 204 °C on Pt/Cu SAA, and 298 °C on Cu nano-
particles, respectively (Fig. 5a). Moreover, according to the Pt
dispersion (Supplementary Table 8) and the speciﬁc activity at
520 °C (Supplementary Table 9), the calculated TOF is 0.72 s−1
for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.56 s−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3. Note that the
TOF value is quite close to that reported for Pt nanoparticles
supported on calcined hydrotalcite53. Combining the results of
TPSR of P–D scrambling and TOFs, we conclude that the
intrinsic activity of Pt/Cu SAA for PDH is only slightly lower
than that of Pt nanoparticle while Cu nanoparticles presents an
extremely low capacity for C–H activation. This supports the
slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA com-
pared with Pt(111) identiﬁed in the DFT studies.
Catalytic performance. We examined the catalytic performances
of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 for PDH to demonstrate the
transferability from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reac-
tion. During the PDH at 520 °C, the propylene formation rate
dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6 mol g−1Pt h−1 for 0.1Pt/
Al2O3 after 12 h on stream (Fig. 5b). As a contrast, we did not
observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12 h on stream
(Fig. 5b) and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased
from 10.6 to 10.3 mol g−1Pt h−1 even after 120 h on stream

(Fig. 5c). The initial propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt10Cu/
Al2O3 is 3.2 times of that for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, at the same time the
selectivity to propylene improves to 90% for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 at
13.1% conversion compared with 70% for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 at 5.8%
conversion. Although DFT calculations predict slightly increased
dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA, its higher propylene
formation rate can be attributed to its better Pt dispersion com-
pared with 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Pt dispersion = 29%). In terms of
deactivation, a ﬁrst-order deactivation model is used to estimate
the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h−1 for
0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability
when compared to 0.07 h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary
Table 9). To further test the stability of the catalysts, the reaction
temperature was increased to 550 °C (Fig. 5b and Supplementary
Figure 24). During 12 h PDH, the formation rate of propylene
dropped from 7.7 to 2.8 mol g−1Pt h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3, corre-
sponding to the deactivation rate of 0.091 h−1. While for
0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, the formation rate of propylene only decreased
from 16.8 to 15.8 mol g−1Pt h−1 and the deactivation rate became
0.012 h−1, verifying its higher activity and better coke resistance.
In addition, we examined the performance of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3
for
successive
oxidation–reduction
cycles.
The
conversion
and selectivity of the catalyst had no change during ﬁve cycles at
520 °C (Supplementary Figure 25), demonstrating its good sta-
bility of dehydrogenation and regeneration. The initial activity of
the catalyst can be largely restored after regeneration at 600 °C
(Supplementary Figure 28), further conﬁrming its cycle stability.
The activity of the 10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH was very low,
which can be neglected compared to that of the 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3
catalyst (Supplementary Figure 31).
We prepared the Pt/Ag SAA catalyst according to similar
atomic dilution method mentioned above. The TPSR of P–D
scrambling experiment indicates similar C–H activation ability
between Pt/Ag SAA and Pt/Cu SAA (Supplementary Figure 20a).
However, under reaction conditions, the propane conversion for
Pt/Ag SAA is only 32% at 600 °C, which is lower than 41% for Pt/
Cu SAA, consistent with the DFT predicted trends (Supplemen-
tary Figure 20b and Supplementary Table 6).
Spent catalysts. The spent catalysts were characterized to further
shed light on the relationship between the improved reaction rate
and stability and the structure of Pt/Cu SAA. DRIFTS of CO on
the spent 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. 5e) show that surface Pt atoms
are still individually dispersed even after a long-term stability test
for 120 h on stream at 520 °C, which suggests the atomic dis-
persion of Pt in Cu is maintained during the PDH reaction. The
slightly increased particle size of the bimetallic nanoparticles on
Al2O3 after reaction indicates the thermal stability of the catalyst
at 520 °C (Supplementary Figure 32). When the reaction tem-
perature was raised to 600 °C, the sintering of copper nano-
particles
was
obvious
(Supplementary
Figure
33),
which
may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3
during the dehydrogenation reaction at 600 °C. In addition,

HAADF-STEM images of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 after successive
oxidation–reduction cycles show that Pt atoms identiﬁed from
their higher brightness comparing to their surrounding area are
still individually dispersed in Cu nanoparticles, conﬁrming its
good cycle stability (Supplementary Figures 26, 27, 29, and 30).
Regrettably, due to the lack of the EXAFS information for the
regenerated 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, the sintering of partial platinum
cannot be fully ruled out. Considering that coke deposition is
another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehy-
drogenation41, the information on the coke formed on the surface
of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected.
The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/
IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/
Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of
dehydrogenation
degree
of
the
coke56.
The
temperature-
programmed oxidation (TPO) proﬁles (Fig. 5f) indicate that
there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two
peaks in each proﬁle. We attribute the small high-temperature
peaks centered at around 500 °C to the combustion of the hard
coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature
peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on
the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of
0.1Pt (335 °C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 °C) > 10Cu (225 °C)56,57. The
good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke
and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies
that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of
Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which cor-
roborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identiﬁed by
the DFT calculations. Moreover, it is worth noting that the target
propylene as coke precursor can partly transform into carbon
deposits with the help of Cu, which accounts for the formation of
coke on Pt/Cu SAA. As shown in Fig. 5f, after treating in the ﬂow
of propylene for the same time, the TPO proﬁle of 0.1Pt10Cu/
Al2O3 is similar to that of 10Cu/Al2O3, conﬁrming the coke
resistance of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 comparable with that of 10Cu/
Al2O3. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of pro-
pylene (Supplementary Figure 22) indicates that the interaction
between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nano-
particles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak
interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to
help remain the activity during reaction.
Discussion
Our DFT calculation shows that different from the conventional
Pt alloys, the Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship
during PDH, displaying a quite negative difference between the
desorption energy and further dehydrogenation barrier of pro-
pylene, and at the same time maintaining a reasonable dehy-
drogenation energy barrier for propane. We further synthesized a
kind of SAA catalysts with single Pt atoms dispersed on Cu and
Ag nanoparticles through an atom dilution method. In the cat-
alytic dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with
the low loading of Pt (0.1 wt%) displays propylene selectivity of
~90% with the high formation rate of 10.6 mol g−1Pt h−1 under
the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520 °C, WHSV = 4 h−1,
C3H8/N2 = 1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120 h on
stream. Our study highlights the transferability from the DFT
calculations to the realistic catalytic system and implies isolated
Pt atoms in the metallic state as promising active sites for alkane
dehydrogenation at high temperatures.
Methods
Computational details. All the total energy self-consistent calculations were car-
ried out in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)58 using the generalized
gradient approximation with the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der
Waals corrections (BEEF-vdW)59,60. We used the projector augmented-wave
(PAW) method to handle the ionic-core interaction61. The valence wave functions
were expanded by plane-wave with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and the electronic
tolerance value is 1 × 10−4 eV. A Methfessel–Paxton smearing with 0.15 eV width
was employed to speed up the convergence and the total energies were evaluated by
extrapolating to zero broadening62. The thickness of the employed (111) slabs,
separated by >15 Å vacuum layer, are ﬁve layers, with top two layers relaxed on
each surface. Optimized geometries were found when the force on each relaxed
atom was <0.02 eV/Å. The Monkhorst–Pack63 k-points mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 was used
in a 4 × 4 unit cell of each model slab. Test calculations indicate the numerical
accuracy for the binding energies with ﬁner k-points meshes is within 0.03 eV. We
applied same parameters for the nanoparticle calculations, except the k-points grid
was reduced to Γ point.
Catalyst preparation. All the catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness co-
impregnation method. H2PtCl6·6H2O (Chemart (Tianjin) Chemical Technology
Co., Ltd, 99.9%) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Alfa Aesar (China) Chemical Co., Ltd,
99.0%) were mixed and used as precursors and γ-Al2O3 (Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd, 98.0%) was used as support. After impregnation, the catalysts
were placed in the atmosphere statically overnight and then dried in the ﬂowing air
at 80 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. The metal loading is based on
the weight ratio between metal and γ-Al2O3.
Characterization. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken
using a JEOL JEM 2100 F system at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped
with a ﬁeld emission gun. For the catalysts of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 and 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3,
the sample was ﬁrstly reduced at 600 °C for 1 h in a stream of 18 vol% H2/N2. Then,
the sample powder was dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonic and supported
on a copper grid coated with an ultrathin holey carbon ﬁlm.
The in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy
(DRIFTS) experiments were performed on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet
IS50 spectrometer, equipped with a Harrick Scientiﬁc DRIFTS cell ﬁtted with ZnSe
windows and a mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid N2.
The DRIFTS measurements were carried out for catalysts with ﬁxed amount of Pt
(0.1 wt%) and different content of Cu. The fresh and spent catalysts were heated
from ambient temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and retained at 600 °C
in a ﬂow rate of 50 mL min−1 of 20 vol% H2/Ar. Then, the catalysts were cooled
down to 30 °C and the backgrounds (8 cm−1 resolution, 64 scans) were collected
after Ar purging in a ﬂow rate of 20 mL min−1 for at least 1 h. With the addition of
a ﬂow of 3 mL min−1 of CO, the adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of the
catalysts continued for 30 min. After that, the DRIFTS spectra were recorded till no
visible change in the absorption band intensities under Ar purging.
High-angle annular dark-ﬁeld scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) images were collected using a Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 (FEI)
200 kV aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-
STEM), capable of sub-angstrom resolution at Tianjin University of Technology.
For the catalysts of 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 and 10Cu/Al2O3, the sample was ﬁrst reduced
at 700 °C for 1 h in a stream of 18 vol% H2/N2. Then, the sample powder was
dispersed in deionized water by ultrasonic and deposited on a molybdenum grid
coated with an ultrathin holey carbon ﬁlm.
Pt L3 edge (11.564 keV) XAS spectra were collected at the 10 ID beam line at
the Advance Photo Source, Argonne National laboratory. Due to the low Pt
loading, the Pt edge was measured in ﬂuorescence mode. Since Cu has a
ﬂuorescence line near that of Pt and there is a large loading of Cu, an energy
resolved ﬂuorescence spectrometer using a bent crystal laue energy analyzer with
soller slits and a Pilatus 100k silicon pixel detector was required to detect from the
weak Pt ﬂuorescence signal without saturating the detector with ﬂuorescence form
copper. Samples for XAS analysis were ground into a ﬁne powder and pressed into
a stainless-steel sample holder. Samples were treated in situ in a custom built
reactor64 and heated to 550 °C in 3% H2 (balance He) for 30 min and then cooled
to 100 °C for collection of spectra. Several spectra were averaged to give the ﬁnal
data used in analysis. There were no noticeable differences in the ﬁrst and last
spectra collected for each sample, demonstrating that the catalyst did not change
over the course of measurement. Helium used was passed through a copper trap to
remove trace oxygen impurities.
Cu–K edge spectra were collected at the 10BM beam line at the Advance Photo
Source, Argonne national laboratory. Samples for XAS analysis were ground into a
ﬁne powder and pressed into a stainless-steel sample holder. Sample holders were
placed in quartz tube reactors equipped with kapton windows and three way valves
for gas ﬂow. Transmission mode samples were treated in 3% H2 (balance He) at
550 °C for 30 min. The gas ﬂow was then switched to pure He for 5 min to desorb
surface hydrogen. The sample was then cooled in helium to room temperature and
the reactor atmosphere was isolated using the three way valves.
Data analysis was performed using WinXAS 3.1 software. Phase and amplitude
functions for Pt–Pt, Pt–O, and Cu–Cu scattering were extracted from experimental
references. Pt–Pt and Cu–Cu scattering phase and amplitude was extracted from
their respective foils (12 neighbors at 2.77 Å for platinum, 12 neighbors at 2.56
angstroms for Cu). Pt–O scattering phase and amplitude was extracted from Na2Pt
(OH)6 (six neighbors at 2.05 angstroms). A phase and amplitude function for
Pt–Cu scattering was created using FEFF using a single Pt–Cu pair with a bond
distance of 2.66 angstroms. The amplitude reduction factor, absolute Debye–Waller

factor and E0 correction for the Pt–Cu scattering pair was taken to be the same as
the platinum foil, so that ﬁt values of E0 and debye-waller factor for Pt–Cu
scattering are relative to that of platinum foil.
Temperature-programmed experiments were all carried out with a
Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. For TPO measurements, 100 mg of
sample was heated at 300 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 80 °C in ﬂowing Ar (30
mL min−1) and then treated in ﬂowing 10 vol% O2/He (20 mL min−1) at a rate of
10 °C min−1 up to 700 °C. The signal of CO2 was recorded by HIDEN QIC-20
mass spectrometer. For TPSR of P–D scrambling, 200 mg of sample was packed in
a quartz tube. The sample was ﬁrst treated by heating at a rate of 10 °C min−1 up to
600 °C and maintaining for 1 h in ﬂowing D2 and then cooled down to 50 °C. After
Ar purging for 30 min, the gas was switched to ﬂowing 18 vol% C3H8/N2 and the
system was purged for 30 min. Subsequently, the temperature of the sample was
raised to 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and the signals at m/z of 45, 44, and 4 were
monitored by the mass spectrometer.
Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated as moles of propylene formed per
mole of exposed Pt per second:
TOF ¼ RC3H6=DPt
ð1Þ
where RC3H6 is the speciﬁc activity of propylene formation (s−1) (Supplementary
Table 8) and DPt is the dispersion of Pt.
Catalytic testing. Catalytic tests were performed in a quartz ﬁxed-bed reactor with
8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length at atmosphere pressure. A volume of 250
mg of the calcined catalyst with particle size of 20–40 mesh was packed inside the
quartz tubular reactor. The sample was ﬁrst heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
−1 and retained at 600 °C for 1 h in ﬂowing 18 vol% H2/N2. Afterward, a mixture of
C3H8, H2, and N2 (8:8:34 vol%) was fed at a rate of 50 mL min−1. The weight
hourly velocity (WHSV) of propane was around 4 h−1. The gas products were
analyzed by an online GC (2060) equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector
(Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 Plot col-
umn). The propane conversion and selectivity to propylene were calculated from
Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), respectively:
