Hydrogen exchange between undeuterated and perdeuterated light alkanes (CD4-C3Hs, 
C3Ds-C3Hs) occurs on H-ZSM5 and on Ga- and Zn-exchanged H-ZSM5 at 773 K. Alkane 
conversion to aromatics occurs much more slowly because it is limited by rate of disposal of 
H-atoms formed in C-H scission steps and not by C-H bond activation. Kinetic coupling of 
these C-H activation steps with hydrogen transfer to acceptor sites (Ga 
n+, Zn 
m+) and ulti- 
mately to stoichiometric hydrogen acceptors (H 
+, CO2, 
02, CO) often increases alkane activa- 
tion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products. Reactions of 13CH4/C3H8 mixtures at 
773 K lead only to unlabelled alkane, alkene, and aromatic products, even though exchange 
between CD4 and C3H8 occurs at these reaction conditions. This suggests that the non- 
oxidative conversion of CH4 to higher hydrocarbons on solid acids is limited by elementary 
steps that occur after the initial activation of 
C-H bonds.

1. Introduction 
Recent studies suggest that electrophilic activation of light alkanes occurs on 
superacid catalysts [1] and on Hg-based organometallic complexes [2] at low tem- 
peratures, and on weaker solid acids at higher temperatures [3-9], apparently via 
heterolytic cleavage of C-H bonds or intermediate partial oxidation of methane to 
methanol. In contrast, oxidative coupling of light alkanes occurs predominantly 
on basic metal oxides and involves homolytic processes and gas phase alkyl radi- 
cals, in which the activation of C-H bonds limit overall oxidative coupling rates 
[10-12].

light alkanes on ZSM5 
Recently, we have shown that the rate of propane conversion to aromatics on 
H-ZSM5 is limited by the removal of H-atoms formed in required dehydrogena- 
tion steps [7-9]. The rate and aromatics selectivity increase when metal cations 
such as Ga 
n+ or Zn 
m+ catalyze the recombination of H-adatoms species to form 
H2, a step that reverses heterolytic dissociation steps typical of reducible metal 
oxide catalysts. Here, we examine the details of the initial C-H activation step and 
the effect of molecular stoichiometric hydrogen acceptors (CO, CO2, 02) on 
the aromatization of light alkanes (C3H8, CH4) catalyzed by H-ZSM5-based 
materials. 
2. Experimental 
Na-ZSM5 (Zeochem, Si/A1 = 14.5) was converted to its protonic form by 
ammonium exchange and then impregnated with a gallium nitrate solution, dried 
at 373 K, and calcined at 623 K for 3 h [6]. This sample (2.0 wt% Ga) was reduced in 
flowing hydrogen at 823 K for I h before catalytic measurements. This treatment 
reduces Ga 
3+ species to Ga 1+ and causes the migration of extracrystalline GazO3 
to cation exchange sites within zeolite channels [9]. Zn-H-ZSM5 samples (2.8 wt% 
Zn) were prepared similarly using a solution of zinc nitrate [8,9]. Zn samples do 
not require a reductive hydrogen pretreatment because, in contrast with Ga, 
impregnation steps apparently distribute Zn ions directly onto intracrystalline 
cation exchange sites [9]. 
Catalytic measurements were performed in a gradientless recirculating batch 
reactor [13]. Reactants and products were analyzed by capillary chromatography 
using thermal conductivity, flame ionization, and mass spectrometric detection. 
Deuterium and 13C distributions were obtained from electron-impact mass spec- 
trometry by correcting for ion fragmentation, natural 13C abundance and kinetic 
isotope effects [13,14]. 
Undeuterated propane (Air Products, 99.5%), perdeuterated propane (MSD 
Isotopes, 99.5% D) and methane (CD4, MSD Isotopes, 99.6% D), 13CH4 (ICON, 
99% 13C), 13COz (Isotec, 99.995%, 99% 13C), 13CO (ICON, 99% 13C), and 02 
(Matheson, 99.99%) were used as reactants without further purification. He (Arco, 
99.99%) was purified using a molecular sieve cooled to liquid N2 temperatures. 
Helium was used as a diluent to maintain total pressures near atmospheric values. 
Deuterium (Air Products, 99.99%) was used without further purification. 
Reactant and product concentrations are reported as turnovers based on A1- 
atoms (mol/g-atom A1) for all catalysts. Turnover rates were obtained from the 
slope of turnover versus time plots. Selectivities are reported on a carbon basis as 
the percentage of converted reactants appearing as a given product.

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. PROPANE REACTIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF D2 
Deuterium (D2) exchanges slowly with propane during its conversion to lighter 
hydrocarbons and C6-C8 aromatics on H-ZSM5. The deuterium fraction in 
unreacted propane increases linearly 
with contact time but remains below 3% even 
at 25-30% propane chemical conversion levels. In contrast, 13C tracer studies of 
propane-2-13C/propylene mixtures suggest that initial dehydrogenation steps in 
the reaction sequence are reversible. These reversible steps should lead to extensive 
deuterium incorporation into those propane molecules that have undergone a 
reversible dehydrogenation-hydrogenation cycle; in contrast, low levels of 
exchange are observed experimentally. 
A study of the deuterium content in the reaction products reveals the underlying 
cause of this apparent contradiction. Previously, we reported that reactions of 
pro- 
pane-2-]3C lead to products containing a random number of 13C atoms, showing 
that every C-C bond is broken and reformed many times in the time required for a 
catalytic turnover [7-9]. This occurs in rapid oligomerization-cracking cycles 
involving 
the alkene products of the initial dehydrogenation 
steps (scheme 1). This 
process allows every C-H bond in each product to exchange extensively with the 
available surface pool of hydrogen adatoms. The deuterium content in the prod- 
ucts then becomes a direct measure of the deuterium content in this surface hydro- 
gen pool. 
The deuterium fraction is between 0.025 and 0.038 and independent of propane 
conversion 
level 
in all 
products of 
propane reactions on H-ZSM5 (fig. 1). The distri- 
bution of D-atom isotopomers within each product obeys a binomial distribution, 
suggesting that multiple exchange events with a common surface hydrogen pool

occur as an intrinsic process during one catalytic turnover. On H-ZSM5, this sur- 
face hydrogen pool contains 2.5-3.8% D and 96.2-97.5% H-atoms, not the 100% 
deuterium content expected from full equilibration with the pure D2 gas phase. 
Most of the surface is covered by protium atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps; 
the removal of these protium atoms limits the overall rate of propane conversion 
to aromatics and prevents equilibration between surface and gas phase hydrogen 
pools. As a result, propane re-acquires H-atoms instead of D-atoms in most rever- 
sible dehydrogenation-hydrogenation steps, leading to slow exchange between 
C3H8 and D2. On H-ZSM5, the predominant disposal pathway is the attachment of 
H-adatoms to hydrocarbon fragments, in steps that lower the selectivity to aro- 
matics by forming predominantly methane and ethane, products that do not form 
readily in carbocation rearrangements because they require formation of primary 
ions. These hydrogen disposal pathways also maintain the surface free of deactivat- 
ing deposits, possibly accounting for the unique stability of H-ZSM5 in many 
alkane conversion reactions. 
Ga and Zn cations within zeolite channels can stabilize hydride ions formed in 
heterolytic dehydrogenation steps and catalyze the recombinative desorption of 
H-adatoms (H 
+ + H-) as H2 [7-9]. As a result, hydrogen desorption-adsorption 
steps become increasingly reversible and the deuterium content in the surface pool 
and in the reaction products increases when such cations are present (fig. 1). For

example, the deuterium fraction (extrapolated to zero conversion) in all propane 
reaction products is about 0.25 on Ga/H-ZSM5 and 0.45 on Zn/H-ZSM5, values 
much higher than those obtained on H-ZSM5 (0.025-0.038). The deuterium con- 
tent decreases with increasing conversion 
because H2 molecules form during C3H8 
conversion on Ga- and Zn-containing catalysts and gradually dilute the initially 
pure D2 gas phase. 
Recombinative hydrogen desorption occurs faster when Ga or Zn cations are 
present and the overall reaction rate increases, but H-disposal is still rate-limiting, 
the deuterium fraction in products remains well below one, and the hydrogen 
pool 
surface still contains 55-75% protium atoms. Concurrent cracking steps are no 
longer required to remove most H-adatoms and the selectivity to C6-C8 aromatic 
products consequently increases. The results described below confirm these find- 
ings and explore the use of stoichiometric 
molecular hydrogen acceptors as poten- 
tial scavengers 
in hydrogen 
disposal. 
3.2. REACTIONS 
OF C3Hs/C3D8 
MIXTURES 
Deuterium exchange studies using D2 suggest that hydrogen disposal rather 
than C-H bond activation limits the overall rate of propane conversion. The cross- 
exchange of hydrogen and deuterium atoms between C3H8 and C3D8 allows the 
simultaneous measurement of C-H bond activation and propane conversion 
rates 
at reaction conditions. 
Cross exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 occurs readily even at low chemical 
conversion levels (fig. 2), suggesting that C-H activation occurs much faster than 
propane conversion. Thus, the rate of C-H activation does not limit the rate of the 
overall chemical conversion of propane on H-ZSM5. The rate of C-H activation, 
measured from the rate of incorporation of D-atoms into C3H8 and of H-atoms 
into C3D8, is about 40 times higher than propane conversion rates (fig. 3). This 
value is obtained by extrapolating the data in fig. 3 to zero conversion. Undeuter- 
ated propane acquires D-atoms from C3D8 more rapidly than from DE because 
hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps required to dissociate D-D bonds on H- 
ZSM5 are slower than C-D bond activation in C3D8. C3H8/C3D8 cross-exchange 
occurs by stepwise 
transfer of single 
D or H atoms, leading 
to statistical isotopomer 
distributions in both the mostly undeuterated and the mostly deuterated propane 
components 
of 
the distribution (fig. 2). 
All chemical conversion products of C3H8/C3D8 mixtures contain similar deu- 
terium fractions (0.436-0.463 D-fraction). These values are only slightly lower 
than the deuterium content in the reactant mixture (0.464), suggesting 
a very small 
H-D kinetic isotope effect in C-H bond activation steps (kd/kh -- 0.9-1.0) at these 
high reaction temperatures. The deuterium isotopomer concentrations within 
each product obey binomial distributions (fig. 4) because all reaction products 
undergo extensive 
exchange 
with a common 
surface hydrogen 
pool in oligomeriza- 
tion-cracking 
sequences 
before desorbing.

The presence of Ga species within zeolite channels leads to much higher propane 
conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (fig. 5). Turnover rates for overall pro- 
pane conversion increase by a factor of about three (fig. 5) and the C6-C8 aromatics 
selectivity increases by about a factor of four, leading to a ten-fold increase in the 
rate of formation of aromatic molecules from propane. Yet, C3Hs-C3D8 exchange 
data show that C-H bond activation rates on H-ZSM5 are almost identical to 
those on Ga/H-ZSM5 (fig. 6). Thus, rate of C-H bond cleavage cannot limit the 
overall reaction rate, because Ga markedly increases the latter without increasing 
C-H bond activation rates. 
The ratio of C-H activation to chemical conversion rates (extrapolated to zero 
conversion, fig. 3) is much lower on Ga-containing samples (N 12 on Ga/H-ZSM5; 
,-~ 40 on H-ZSM5). Ga sites catalyze rate-limiting hydrogen disposal steps by pro- 
viding alternate recombinative desorption pathways unavailable on H-ZSM5; as 
this step, and the overall conversion rate, become faster, the net rate of other steps 
in the sequence becomes comparable to that of hydrogen desorption. This is the 
case for C-H propane bond activation of Ga/H-ZSM5, although C-H activation 
steps remain much faster than H-atom removal (~ 12 times, fig. 3) and hydrogen 
disposal is still the rate-limiting step in the overall propane conversion sequence on 
Ga/H-ZSM5, a conclusion confirmed by deuterium exchange studies using D2.

3.3. THE EFFECT OF MOLECULAR HYDROGEN ACCEPTORS ON REACTIONS OF 
PROPANE 
If hydrogen disposal by recombinative desorption or hydrogen transfer to 
adsorbed hydrocarbons limits propane conversion rates and especially the selectiv- 
ity to aromatic products, stoichiometric scavengers of such H-adatoms should 
enhance aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5. Clearly, these pathways will require the 
presence of binding sites for such molecular hydrogen sinks. These hydrogen addi- 
tion reactions would kinetically couple with the sequential dehydrogenation steps 
required for propane conversion to aromatics and relieve a bottleneck within the 
catalytic sequence. In some cases, they also could provide an additional thermody- 
namic incentive for the conversion of alkanes to unsaturated products. Ideally, 
the required hydrogen transfer processes should also lead to more valuable forms 
of the hydrogen acceptor, which is used here as a sacrificial reagent. 
The presence of 02, 13CO, or 13CO2 
increases the selectivity of propane conver- 
sion to aromatics on H-ZSM5 (fig. 7). Small amounts of 02 (1.6 kPa) increase the 
initial selectivity from near zero to 12-13% (fig. 7); 02 is not, however, a selective 
hydrogen scavenger and also reacts with propane to form CO2. Dioxygen is totally 
depleted from the reactant stream at 10-15% propane conversion; at higher conver- 
sions, propane reacts via non-oxidative pathways and the selectivity to aromatics 
begins to resemble that obtained using a pure propane feed (fig. 7). Aromatics selec-

tivity increases with increasing conversion in all cases (fig. 7) because higher con- 
centration of alkene intermediates favor chain growth and formation of the C6+ 
hydrocarbon backbones required for ring closure and aromatization (scheme 1). 
The propane conversion turnover rate is slightly lower when small amounts of Oz 
are present in the alkane feed (fig. 8). 
CO2 increases the aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (fig. 7) without any change 
in propane conversion turnover rates (fig. 8). Reactions of 13CO2-C3H8 mixtures 
lead to the formation of 13CO; hydrocarbon products, however, contained only 
natural abundance 13C. Thus, the predominant reaction of CO2 on H-ZSM5 is its 
hydrogenation using H-adatoms produced in sequential hydrocarbon dehydro- 
genation steps. Hydrogenation of the resulting low concentrations of CO to 
methane and higher hydrocarbons does not occur readily on H-ZSM5 at these reac- 
tion conditions. Turnover rates for hydrogenation of CO2 to CO (1.4 • 10 
-4 S 
-1) 
are much smaller than propane conversion turnover rates (4.2 x 10 
-3 s 
-1) on 
H-ZSM5. As a result, the effect of CO2 on propane conversion selectivity is small, 
because hydrogen removal by reaction of H-adatoms with oxygen atoms in CO2 is 
slow compared with the dehydrogenation reactions that produce such hydrogen 
adatoms. 
CO addition also increases aromatics selectivity during propane conversion on 
H-ZSM5 (fig. 7). Small amounts of 13CO disappear from 13CO/C3H8 mixtures but 
the 13C content in reaction products is very low (<0.2% in CH4; 0.2-0.4% in

C2H4, C2H6 and 1-C4H8; 0.8-1.3% in benzene; 0.6-0.8% in toluene). Propane con- 
version turnover rates are lower when CO is present and carbon deposits form 
more readily than with pure propane feeds. The low activity persists in subsequent 
runs using pure propane as reactant; it reflects extensive deactivation that occurs 
during conversion of CO/propane mixtures rather than reversible inhibition of 
propane reactions by CO. When deactivated catalysts are treated with 02 after 
reaction, significant amounts of 13CO2 are formed, suggesting that the 13CO com- 
ponent contributes to carbon deposition. These carbon deposits apparently 
account for the lower activity of H-ZSM materials in reactions of C3H8/CO mix- 
tures. Propane carbonylation products form on HF-SbF5 superacids at much 
lower temperatures [15] but are not detected on H-ZSM5 at 773 K because these 
molecules 
are thermodynamically 
unstable at these reaction conditions. 
The observed low activity and carbon deposits, the low level of t3C enrichment 
in hydrocarbons (< 1.5% 13C) and CO2 products, and the promoting effect of CO 
on aromatics selectivity 
suggest that oxygen, as atoms or within undissociated 
CO, 
scavenges H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, leaving behind carbonac- 
eous deposits,

thus increasing the selectivity 
to unsaturated products. A slight 13C enrichment 
in 
the C6-C8 aromatic products (0.6-1.5%) suggests that carbon or highly 
dehydroge- 
nated CHx species formed from CO can participate in aromatics formation steps. 
The 13C enrichment in lighter products (C1-C5) was much lower (< 0.4%) than in 
the aromatic fraction (0.6-1.3%). 
Thus, CO acts as a stoichiometric hydrogen scavenger but without significant 
formation of gas phase carbon-containing 
products and without upgrading CO to 
more valuable products. A more effective pathway for H-atom removal is the 
hydrogenation 
of adsorbed CO to CH4, a process that also improves the thermody- 
namics of dehydrogenation steps, but which does not occur on H-ZSM5 at our 
reaction conditions. 
None of the molecular hydride acceptors used increased aromatics selectivity 
to the high values obtained on Ga- or Zn-promoted H-ZSM5 (fig. 7), suggesting 
that the surface density or reactivity of these adsorbed molecules 
is lower than that 
of reducible metal cations. NO also reacts with alkanes and alkenes on H-ZSM5 
[16] and on Ga/H-ZSM5 [17] 
to form 
N2 and H20; undoubtedly, 
these 
NOx species 
also act as hydrogen acceptors and increase the rate of propane conversion to 
unsaturated products. 
On H-ZSM5 promoted with Ga or Zn, 13CO or 13CO2 added to propane feeds 
also increased aromatics selectivity (Zn, fig. 9). As on H-ZSM5, 13CO2 leads

predominantly to 13CO and H20, and 13CO to surface carbon deposits and to less 
than 0.2% 13C enrichment in reaction products. The aromatics selectivity 
enhance- 
ments are less marked than on H-ZSM5, as expected from the presence of Zn or 
Ga species, which already provide alternate and effective pathways for hydrogen 
removal as H2. 
Hydrogen acceptor species, whether molecules (CO2, CO, 02) or metal cations 
(Ga 
n+, Znm+), increase the ethylene to ethane ratio in the C2 products formed by 
concurrent cracking reactions of propane. These hydrogen acceptors also decrease 
the selectivity to methane during propane conversion. This suggests that the intro- 
duction of alternate H-disposal pathways removes the burden of hydrogen 
removal from H-addition and cracking steps that form light alkanes. The alternate 
pathways provided by hydride acceptor species lower the effective surface hydro- 
gen pressure during propane reactions on H-ZSM5 and prevent hydrogenation and 
cracking, reactions that require H-adatom reactants [7,8]. 
3.4. REACTIONS OF C3H8/CD4 MIXTURES 
H-ZSM5 also activates C-H bonds in methane, but much more slowly than the 
weaker and more reactive C-H bonds in propane. Deuterium appears within the 
unreacted propane fraction in C3H 
8/CD4 reactant mixtures (fig. 10). Exchange 
occurs by stepwise addition of D-atoms from a surface hydrogen pool that contains 
a mixture of D-atoms from CD4 and H-atoms from C3H8. The D-atom fraction

in propane increases linearly with contact time leading to a concurrent increase in 
the deuterium content of its products (fig. 11) and in the protium content of the 
methane co-reactant. 
The deuterium content in reaction products is, however, higher than in propane 
(fig. 11). In all products (e.g., ethylene, ethane, propylene, benzene, toluene), the 
isotopic content is similar and their excess deuterium content (over that in propane) 
is independent of conversion on H-ZSM5 (fig. 11); also, isotopomer concentra- 
tions for each product obey a binomial distribution, suggesting that all products 
statistically sample the composition of a common surface hydrogen pool before 
desorption. The deuterium fraction within reaction products at short contact times 
(low propane conversions), where the propane reactant is totally undeuterated, is 
about 0.05 on H-ZSM5 (fig. 11), consistent with a surface pool containing about 
5% D-atoms (from 20 kPa CD4) and 95% H-atoms (from 6.66 kPa C3H8). Thus, the 
rate of C-H activation for methane in this reactant mixture is about 20 times 
slower than that of propane, a result that is unlikely 
to reflect a H-D kinetic isotope 
effect, in view of the small isotope effects reported above for C3Ds-C3H8 mix- 
tures. The relative C-H bond reactivity in methane becomes 30 times greater when 
C-H bond activation rates are normalized using the fraction of the available 
C-H(D) bonds contained within CH4 and C3H8 molecules in the reactant mix- 
ture. 
The details of similar studies on Ga/H-ZSM5 will be reported elsewhere. In con-

trast with H-ZSM5, the rate of C-H bond activation on Ga/H-ZSM5 is only about 
4-5 times slower (~ 7 when normalized 
to the number of C-H bonds in each reac- 
tant) for methane than for propane (fig. 12, 18% D in products). This somewhat 
surprising result shows that factors other than C-H bond strength must be 
involved 
in heterolytic C-H bond dissociation of light alkanes on acidic materials. 
Clearly, the stability of the carbocation and of its hydridic H-atom counterpart 
also influences 
C-H bond activation 
rates. 
The extreme thermodynamic instability of primary carbocations may well 
require that C-H bond activation in CH4 proceed via pathways different from 
those involved in the activation of propane and larger alkanes, which can form 
more stable secondary and tertiary carbocations. In such alternate homolytic or 
heterolytic pathways, Ga cations may actually stabilize the neutral or negatively 
charged carbon-containing fragment of the C-H bond activation step, instead of 
the H- species it apparently accommodates 
in propane conversion 
reactions. These 
alternate pathways, unavailable on H-ZSM5 and unnecessary for larger alkanes, 
may account for the disproportionate increase in the C-H bond reactivity of 
methane introduced by the presence of Ga cations within H-ZSM5 channels. Ga- 
and Zn-containing H-ZSM5 zeolites, however, remain unable to provide alkyla- 
tion and chain growth pathways of the C-H activation products to form higher 
molecular 
weight 
hydrocarbons in non-oxidative 
reactions of 
methane.

tent in unreacted propane and in propylene and benzene reaction products (773 K, 6.66 kPa C3H8, 
20.0 kPa CD4). 
The products of 13CH4/C3H8 (20.0 kPa, 6.67 kPa, 773 K)reactant mixtures on 
H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSMS, and Zn/H-ZSM5 are not labelled; about 5-10% 13C 
enrichment should occur if relative conversion rates of the two reactants paralleled 
their relative C-H bond activation rates on these catalysts. The observed 13C 
enrichment in reaction products is less than 0.5%. Clearly, the stability of C1 carbo- 
cations precludes their presence at high surface concentrations on thermodynamic 
grounds. Their stability may increase or their involvement may become unneces- 
sary when alkyl or hydride acceptor species such as Ga 
~+ provide thermodynamic 
sinks for the hydrogen or carbon fragments of the C-H bond activation step. This 
may explain why the relative reactivity of C-H bonds in methane compared to pro- 
pane is higher on Ga / H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5.
