Abstract
Periodic DFT calculations show that stability of binuclear cationic gallium–oxo clusters in high-silica zeolites is mainly controlled by the
favorable geometrical environment of the Ga3+ ions, whereas the effect of the direct interaction with the charge-compensating framework anionic
sites is less important. Extraframework cyclic Ga2O2+
2
cations are shown to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
Chemical reactivity of zeolites can be substantially affected
by the presence of extraframework transition metal cations [1].
In order to understand their role in catalytic reactions insight
into the molecular structure of these intrazeolitic species is de-
sired. This however still remains a challenge in zeolite chem-
istry. For univalent cations, a well-accepted model is localiza-
tion of the positively charged ions in the vicinity of the nega-
tively charged framework aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahe-
dra [1]. For cations with a higher charge, this model requires
close proximity of the aluminum substitutions in the zeolite
framework. This requirement may not always be met, espe-
cially for high-silica zeolites such as MFI and mordenite, which
are industrially important catalysts [1]. Recently, an alternative
model has been put forward involving indirect charge compen-
sation of Zn2+ ions by the negative ZSM-5 zeolite framework
to account for the high reactivity of Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite in alkane
activation [2]. The bivalent cation is placed in the vicinity of
one framework anionic [AlO2]−site, while the other negative
framework site is located at a larger distance where it does not
directly interact with the extraframework species. In spite of

some spectroscopic [2] and theoretical [3] support, a ﬁrm ba-
sis for a model, in which the position of multivalent cations
in zeolites is not dominated by localized charge compensation
between the cation and the framework charge, is lacking. One
notes however that indirect charge compensation is not uncom-
mon in coordination compounds: a central metal ion is often
surrounded by neutral ligands, while the charge-compensating
anion is located outside the coordination shell [4]. To estab-
lish in more detail how charge compensation is accomplished in
high-silica zeolites, we carried out a periodic DFT study of the
interaction of isomeric bivalent (GaO)2+
2
species with a model
of zeolite mordenite (MOR, Si/Al = 23). We have recently
shown that in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 binuclear gallium-containing
cationic species are the catalytically active clusters for alkane
dehydrogenation [5]. It is not straightforward to see how these
ions can be uniformly present in zeolites with a low Al content
when the conventional charge-compensation model is followed.
Therefore, we computed the structure of several (GaO)2+
2
ions
in mordenite with different Al distributions in the framework.
The results indicate that our thinking of localization of multi-
valent cations in terms of direct charge compensation should be
reconsidered.
Gallium-modiﬁed zeolites are effective catalysts for the
aromatization of light alkanes [6]. Well-deﬁned Ga cations in
HZSM-5 can be prepared by the reaction of Ga(CH3)3 with

Brønsted acid sites, resulting in grafted Ga(CH3)+
2 species [6b].
Careful removal of the methyl ligands leads to isolated Ga+
ions. These ions dehydrogenate propane to propylene which
is the ﬁrst step in its aromatization. Further treatment of such
Ga+ ions with N2O led to a considerable improvement of the
catalytic activity, which was initially attributed to formation of
isolated gallyl ions (GaO+) [6b,7]. Recent theoretical studies
have clearly shown that these species cannot be responsible
for stable catalytic activity [8] and an alternative interpreta-
tion is the formation of extraframework oligomeric (GaO)n+
n
species. The occurrence of cationic binuclear gallium–oxo clus-
ters in ZSM-5 has been supported by EXAFS measurements
and used to explain the enhancement of catalytic activity of Ga/
ZSM-5 upon water co-feeding [5]. The important question here
is whether proximate Al substitutions in the zeolite framework
are necessary to stabilize these binuclear cationic species.
2. Computational details
The quantum-chemical calculations were carried out using
Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [9] within DFT
with the gradient-corrected PW91 [10] exchange-correlation
functional. The projected-augmented wave (PAW) method [11]
was used to describe electron–ion interactions, and for valence
electrons a plane wave basis set was employed. The energy
cut-off was set to 400 eV. The Brillouin zone sampling was
restricted to the Γ -point [12]. Cell parameters were initially
optimized for the mordenite model. The parameters obtained
were then used in all calculations. Full geometry optimizations
were performed for each structure with the ﬁxed cell parame-
ters using a conjugated gradient algorithm. Convergence was
assumed to be reached when the forces on each atom were be-
low 0.05 eV/Å. A modest Gaussian smearing was applied to
band occupations around the Fermi level (σ = 0.1 eV) and the
total energies were extrapolated to σ →0.
The nudged elastic band method (NEB) [13] with improved
tangent estimate was used to determine the minimum energy
path and to locate the transition-state structures of elemen-
tary reactions involved in ethane dehydrogenation. The maxi-
mum energy geometries obtained with NEB method were then
optimized separately using a quasi-Newton algorithm. In this
step only positions of the atoms from Ga-containing extra-
framework intermediates and [AlO2]−framework sites were
optimized, while the remaining ions were ﬁxed according to
the positions obtained from the previous step.
The nature of the stationary point obtained was tested by
analyzing the calculated harmonic normal modes, which were
calculated using the ﬁnite difference method as implemented in
VASP. Small displacements (0.02 Å) of atoms from the extra-
framework species and of the zeolitic ions directly bound to
them were used for the estimation of numerical Hessian matrix.
The rest of the zeolitic atoms were kept ﬁxed to their equilib-
rium positions.
As detailed periodic DFT calculations with the large ZSM-5
unit cell are prohibitive in terms of computer demand, we
choose mordenite as a model for a high-silica zeolite. Its purely
siliceous structure has Cmcm space group symmetry. The or-

respectively, with solid and dashed lines. Supercell of high-silica mordenite

the mordenite supercell model was cut along [001] and rolled out). The loca-
tions of Al ions are shown as circles at appropriate positions in models I and II.
thorhombic cell of mordenite contains 144 atoms (48 Si and
96 O) [14]. It is possible, however, to choose a smaller lower
symmetry monoclinic primitive cell of 72 atoms (24 Si and
48 O) [15] (Fig. 1a). After optimizing volume and shape, the
parameters of the primitive cell are the following: a = b =
13.648 Å, c = 7.508 Å, and γ = 97◦. These correspond to the
cell parameters a1 = 18.087 Å, b1 = 20.443, c1 = 7.508 of the
conventional orthorhombic unit cell, which cohere well with the
experimental XRD data [14]. To model a high-silica zeolite, a
supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the mon-
oclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained
48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged
mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with
aluminums. The resulting models I and II (Figs. 1b and 1c,
respectively) differ in framework Al distribution (Fig. 1d). In
the case of model I both Al ions were located in one 8-
membered ring connecting the main channel with the side-
pocket of mordenite. In model II aluminum ions were located
in the side-pockets opposite to each other in the main chan-
nel.

3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 summarizes the stabilities of various (GaO)2+
2
struc-
tures for the two models. The energy of the initial system with
two Ga+ ions does not depend on the Al distribution in the ze-
olite. Oxidation of the Ga+ sites with N2O to isolated GaO+
(1 and 1′) ions is slightly exothermic. Formation of two isolated
gallyl ions in a single side-pocket of MOR (1) requires a slightly
unfavorable coordination of one of the GaO+ cations to the ze-
olite wall. Geometry optimization of a similar starting structure
but with both GaO+ species initially coordinated to the oxy-
gen anions of one 8T-ring of model I leads to structure 2 which
is more stable by 118 kJ/mol. Similarly, rearrangement of the
gallyl ions in model II results in the formation of an oxygen-
bridged dimer 2′ with an energy beneﬁt of 114 kJ/mol.
Further stabilization of the extraframework species is
achieved by formation of an almost square-planar (Ga2O2)2+
(3 and 3′) cation. This further lowers the total energies by 319
and 177 kJ/mol for models I and II, respectively. This relatively
large difference between the two models is due to the formation
of an almost perfect tetrahedral coordination of both Ga ions
in the side-pocket of MOR in the case of 3. The less favorable
coordination of structure 3′ is due to stabilization of Ga2O2+
2
along the zeolite channel that does not allow the favorable tetra-
hedral coordination around the Ga ions. This difference already
points to the importance of optimal coordination around the Ga
centers of the extraframework cationic complex. A more fa-
vorable location of the (GaO)2+
2
ion in model II is obtained
by allowing the complex to adopt tetrahedral coordination of
Ga to oxygen anions in the side pocket (3′′). The energy of this
structure 3′′ is lower by 30 kJ/mol, despite the separation of the
charges: one Ga3+ ion coordinates to a neutral silicon-occupied
oxygen tetrahedron and is located 5.441 Å away from the neg-
ative framework charge in the main channel. The favorability
of such an unconventional charge compensation of a cationic
complex derives from the dominance of the energy gain due to
the stable tetrahedral surrounding of Ga3+ over the energy loss
resulting from the lack of a counterion in the ﬁrst coordination
sphere of the metal center. It is important however to realize that
the oxygen atoms (Oδ−), which bridge between lattice silicons,
are sufﬁciently basic to stabilize positively charged species.
Thus, the computations indicate that stabilization of the pro-
posed binuclear gallium–oxo cations in high-silica zeolites is
possibly independent of the Al distribution. The presence of
such cationic Ga clusters is not surprising considering the large
number of organometallic complexes of binuclear Ga centers.
Indeed, a search of the Cambridge Structural Database [16] has
revealed 139 different compounds containing a cyclic Ga2O2
moiety, whereas no crystal structure containing a terminal gal-
lyl moiety was found. Most of these multinuclear compounds
contain bis-(μ2-OR)-di-gallium moieties (R = H, alkyl) analo-
gous to those proposed in Ref. [5]. In addition, different poly-
hedron structures composed of such fragments have been de-
scribed [17]. These bis-(μ2-oxo)-di-gallium moieties can only
be stabilized when chelating ligands coordinate to Ga [18].
In the present case, the zeolite framework can be considered
a rigid polydentate ligand coordinating to the exchangeable
cations.
Unlike ligands in solution, zeolites cannot adjust their struc-
ture signiﬁcantly to provide the most effective stabilization of
the intrazeolite cationic species. The dimensions of channel
openings and cations sites of zeolites with different framework
structures can differ from those of mordenite. Despite this, one
expects that independently of the particular framework Al dis-
tribution, the rather large binuclear Ga2O2+
2
cations can coordi-
nate to the Oδ−-rich walls of high-silica zeolites with different
morphologies in a variety of ways (not necessarily along the
diameter of the zeolite channel) resulting in the stable tetrahe-

dral or close to tetrahedral coordination of gallium ions. Thus,
taking into account the above discussion and the extreme cal-
culated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+
2
sites in mordenite, we
conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized
gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close
to the ion-exchange capacity.
In catalysis, the most stable sites often show signiﬁcantly
lower reactivity than lesser stable ones. To check whether this
would also be the case for the Ga2O2 isomers, we calculated
the energetics of the most important reaction steps (C–H bond
activation and H2 recombination) of catalytic dehydrogenation
of ethane over the most stable structure 3 (Scheme 1) and over
mononuclear GaO+. For comparison the reaction energies for
the respective elementary steps were computed for the charge-
alternating structure 3′′. The calculated reaction (E) and ac-
tivation energies (E‡) are summarized in Table 1.
Initial C–H bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic
with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 →4). The cal-
culated reaction energy of E = −62 kJ/mol is lower than
that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on iso-
lated gallyl ion in II (E = −258 kJ/mol), while the difference
in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Ta-
ble 1). Subsequently, the grafted C2H−
5 group decomposes to
gas-phase ethylene and a hydride ion bound to Ga. This en-
dothermic process depends only slightly on the nature of the
Ga species [8]. Closure of the catalytic cycle by H2 recombina-
tion from 5 is possible over the binuclear Ga2O2+
2
site (E‡ =
168 kJ/mol, Table 1), whereas the barrier over the less stable
isolated GaO+ site is prohibitively high (E‡ = 326 kJ/mol).
The difference lies in the decreased basicity of the bridging ex-
traframework oxygen anion. Thus, such bridging oxygens are
essential to close the catalytic cycle by hydrogen recombina-
tion. One notes that the calculated reaction energies (Table 1)
as well as the geometrical parameters of the intermediates (see
Supplementary material) involved in the dissociative C2H6 ad-
sorption and H2 recombination over 3 and 3′′ are very similar
(Table 1). This suggests that the reactivity of the binuclear Ga
sites depends only slightly on the mode of charge compensa-
tion.
In conclusion, cationic binuclear gallium–oxo clusters are
more stable than isolated gallyl ions in high-silica zeolites and
should be considered as active sites for light alkane dehydro-
genation. Gallyl ions tend to oligomerize resulting in formation
of oxygen-bridged Ga3+ pairs. The stability of such cationic
binuclear complexes does not require proximate Al substitu-
tions of the framework. The location and stability of such
cationic clusters in the micropores is mainly controlled by the
favorable coordinational environment around the Ga3+ centers.
The effect of localized charge compensation is of lesser im-
portance. Non-localized charge compensation is argued to be
common in zeolites: the presence of multiply charged bi- or
oligonuclear metal oxide species in zeolites does not require
the immediate proximity of an equivalent number of negative
framework charges.
