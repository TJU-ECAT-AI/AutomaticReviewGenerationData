BiscardiEnrique Iglesia View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract Reactions of 13C-labeled alkanes show that chain growth and cyclization reactions on HZSM5 require the initial formation of the corresponding alkene and its extensive participation in rapid oligomerization/β-scission reactions before cyclization occurs. The role of alkene intermediates was established by the initial formation of predominantly unlabeled products from mixtures of propene and propane-2-13C reactants. Aromatic products of propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 contain similar fractions of 13C-atoms and binomial isotopomer distributions. Sequential formation, rapid intramolecular isomerization, and β-scission reactions of long surface chains must occur during each aromatization turnover in order to form such binomial 13C isotopomer distributions.

1. Introduction
In contrast with gas-phase pyrolysis pathways, which lead to tars and coke, non-oxidative catalytic reactions of light alkanes on HZSM5 form C6C9 aromatics. The restricted channel environment in ZSM5 1,2 and the ability of these catalysts to maintain a high hydrogen surface pressure during alkane reactions 3,4 inhibit carbon formation and lead to their unique stability at the high temperatures and low H2 concentration required for aromatization of alkanes. Light alkane chain growth pathways on zeolitic acids involve dehydrogenation, dimerization, cyclization, and aromatization steps, which proceed in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking steps. 5-7 Numerous studies have addressed the mechanism of chain growth and cyclization during light alkane reactions with primary emphasis on measuring the effect of catalyst composition on reaction rate and selectivity. 5-12 Here, we report direct evidence for the mechanistic sequence and for reactive intermediates using 13C isotopic tracer and exchange methods.
2. Experimental Conditions
2.1. Catalyst Preparation. Na+ ions in NaZSM5 (Zeochem) were replaced with NH4+ by contacting the zeolite with a solution of 0.67 M NH4NO3 (Fisher, Certified ACS, >98.0%) at 353 K for 10 h. Solids were separated from the solution by filtering. The exchange procedure was repeated three times using fresh NH4NO3 solutions in order to ensure complete exchange of Na cations (residual Na content < 0.07% by elemental analysis). The catalyst samples were then dried in flowing air at 383 K for 20 h and calcined in flowing air at 773 K for 20 h in order to decompose NH4+ to H+, which resulted in the acidic form of the zeolite (HZSM5). The elemental composition of all samples was obtained by atomic emission spectroscopy (Galbraith Laboratories). The atomic Si/Al ratio was 14.5  0.9.
2.2. Catalytic Reaction Studies. Kinetic studies on HZSM5 catalysts were performed in a gradientless recirculating reactor operated in batch mode. Chemical compositions of reaction products were measured as a function of reaction time and reactant conversion. The reaction mixture was circulated using a graphite gear micropump (250 cm3 min-1, Cole-Parmer) that allowed differential reactor operation (<2% reactant conversion per pass). All propane reactions were carried out at 773 K.
The chemical composition of reaction mixtures was obtained using capillary column gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (Hewlett-Packard 5890, HP-1 methyl silicone column, 50 m, 0.32 mm diameter, 1.05 μm thickness) and electron-impact mass spectrometry (Hewlett-Packard 5972 mass selective detector). 13C isotopomers were calculated from fragmentation patterns using mathematical models that correct for the mass spectral fragmentation and natural isotopic impurities. 13 Propane (Matheson, chemical purity > 99.5%), propene (Matheson, chemical purity > 99.0%), ethene (Matheson, chemical purity > 99.0%), and propane-2-13C (Cambridge Isotopes, chemical purity > 98.0%, isotopic purity > 99.0%) were used as reactants without further purification. Helium (Linde, chemical purity > 99.995%) and hydrogen (Matheson, chemical purity > 99.5%) were purified by passage through oxygen and molecular sieve traps (13X and 5A) at room temperature. Helium was used as an inert diluent in most of the catalytic studies.
Propane conversion turnover rates are reported as the molar rate of propane conversion per g-atom Al in the catalyst charge. Batch reactor data are shown as product site yields (moles of product g-atom Al) or reactant turnovers (moles of C3H8 converted per g-atom Al) as a function of contact time. The slopes of these plots give propane conversion turnover rates or product site-time yields. Hydrocarbon selectivities are reported on a carbon basis as the percentage of the converted propane that appears as each reaction product. Hydrogen selectivities are reported as the percentage of the hydrogen atoms in the converted propane that appear within a given hydrocarbon product or as H2.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalytic Reactions of Propane on HZSM5. On HZSM5, the initial products of propane conversion at 773 K are primarily propene, H2, and equimolar amounts of ethene and methane. Small amounts of ethane and aromatics are also formed initially (<5%). The initial rate of methane formation (7.7 × 10-4 s-1) is faster than the initial rate of propene formation (3.0 × 10-4 s-1). Ethene and propene are formed with high selectivity at low conversions and decrease with increasing conversion as they are converted to more stable products (e.g. aromatics, alkanes) (Figure 1). Ethene selectivity decreases faster than propene selectivity with increasing conversion. This may suggest that ethene converts to stable products faster than propene on HZSM5. This is not supported, however, by the individual turnover rates using strictly ethene or propene feeds. On HZSM5, propene conversion turnover rates (15.0 × 10-4 s-1) are faster than ethene conversion turnover rates (2.4 × 10-4 s-1). The ethene selectivity decreases faster because, at longer contact times, acid-catalyzed alkene oligomerization/β-scission reactions control propane conversion selectivity. These oligomerization/β-scission reactions are constrained by the zeolite pore structure and by the thermodynamics governing these alkene reactions. On HZSM5, Tabak et al. 14 have shown that alkenes first polymerize on Bronsted acid sites to form dimers and trimers, followed by isomerization, β-scission, and further oligomerization. Thus, these alkene oligomerization/cracking reactions on Bronsted acid sites lead to a more rapid decrease in ethene selectivity during propane conversion because the formation of ethene, unlike propene, requires unstable primary carbocations.

At low conversions, aromatic products, consisting of a mixture of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and a low concentration of larger aromatics, form slowly. The predominant aromatic product of propane is not benzene, the expected product of c simple dimerization steps, but toluene. Aromatic concentrations increase with conversion because aromatics are secondary products of propane. At higher conversions, reactions of propane on HZSM5 lead to aromatics, alkenes, and alkanes with a broad molecular weight distribution (Table 1).

hydrogen(H2)   4.0 The ratio of 1-butene and isobutene to cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene on HZSM5 instantaneously reaches its equilibrium value (1.44). 15 This indicates that double bond, cis/trans, and skeletal isomerizations occur readily and become quasi-equilibrated steps on HZSM5 even at low conversions. Dihydrogen (H2) selectivity remains low and independent of conversion on HZSM5 (4.06.0%), while light alkane (C2 and C4) selectivities increase with increasing propane conversion (Figure 2). Most of the adsorbed hydrogen species formed in dehydrogenation steps appear to transfer to carbonaceous surface species and form C2 or C4 alkanes, rather than recombining and desorbing into the gas phase as H2. The C2 and C4 alkane selectivities increase with increasing conversion because of the higher abundance of hydrogen atoms on the surface as the rate of formation of aromatics increases with increasing contact time.

3.2. Mechanism of Propane Activation Reactions on Bronsted Acid Sites. It has been suggested that carbocations are the reactive surface intermediates in alkane reactions catalyzed by Bronsted acids. 16,17 However, these surface intermediates may not be true carbocation species, but instead alkoxide species that retain cationic character only in activated complexes during chemical reactions. 18-22
Mechanistic proposals for light alkane reactions on acid catalysts include hydride transfer from the alkane to an adsorbed carbenium ion (Scheme 1), 23-26 or protonation of alkenes, formed in preceding dehydrogenation steps to form a carbenium ion (Scheme 2), 27-28 or direct interaction of the alkane with a proton to form a carbonium ion, followed by H2 desorption to form a carbenium ion (Scheme 3).26 Scheme 1: Bimolecular Mechanism Involving Hydride Transfer to Adsorbed Carbenium Ions Scheme 2: Monomolecular Mechanism Involving Alkane Dehydrogenation and Then Adsorption of Alkenes on Bronsted Acid Sites The relative contributions of these mechanistic routes in the initial activation of propane on HZSM5 can be measured using reaction mixtures of propane and propene. Propane-2-13C (12CH313CH212CH3) was used as a reactant to distinguish between the propane fed initially and the propane formed from propene hydrogenation. The propane conversion rates were calculated from those products containing 13C, which form only from the propane-2-13C in the feed. This propane/propene reaction mixture allows the measurements of true propane conversion rates during propene addition without contributions by the products of propene reactions. Bimolecular reaction pathways (Scheme 1) would lead to higher propane-2-13C activation turnover rates when propene is added to the propane-2-13C reactants; monomolecular propane activation pathways (Schemes 2 and 3) would be unaffected by the presence of propene.
Turnover rates for propane-2-13C conversion on HZSM5 did not increase when unlabeled propene was added (Figure 3), suggesting that, at propane partial pressures, propane forms reactive intermediates via monomolecular routes. The propane-2-13C turnover rate on HZSM5 is 6.1 × 10-4 s-1 with pure propane and only 5.8 × 10-4 s-1 when unlabeled propene is present. These data rule out the possibility that trace amounts of alkenes could significantly influence the rate of propane conversion by providing C3+ carbocations that activate propane in hydrogen-transfer bimolecular reactions.
Figure 3 Propane-2-13C turnovers versus contact time during propane conversion on HZSM5 with and without unlabeled propene (773 K, 6.67 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 01.07 kPa C3H6, balance He).
Scheme 3: Monomolecular Mechanism Involving Direct Protonation of the Reacting Alkane The remaining question is how monomolecular pathways occur: by direct protonation of a propane molecule to form carbonium ions (C3H9+), which then decompose to C3H7+ and H2 (or C2H5+ and CH4)26 or by independent dehydrogenation of alkanes on redox sites followed by gas-phase transfer of alkenes to protonic sites where they undergo conventional acid catalysis.27,28 Our studies support the suggestion of propane activation by a monomolecular route, but provide no direct evidence for distinguishing among these mechanisms on HZSM5.
3.3. Isotopic Tracer Studies of the Initial Formation of Propene Reactive Intermediates. The initial rate of propane dehydrogenation and the reactive nature of the propene formed were probed by measuring the chemical and isotopic composition of reaction products formed from reactions of unlabeled propene and propane-2-13C. The 13C content in reaction products (extrapolated to zero conversion or contact time) provides a direct measure of the fraction of the products that formed directly from propane without requiring propene intermediates. Isotopic contents in products below that in C3H8-2-13C (0.33) would require contributions from unlabeled propene.
The initial benzene, toluene, and xylene products on HZSM5 are predominantly unlabeled, consistent with their direct formation from the unlabeled propene in the feed (Figure 4). The isotopic content in these products increases in parallel with that in propene, because they are formed from increasingly 13C-enriched propene. The 13C content in toluene and benzene is slightly lower than in propene because of the fast initial formation of unlabeled larger alkenes, which are diluted slowly with time as the products of the enriched propane reactant begin to contribute to the observed products. The 13C fraction is similar in all aromatic products, suggesting that they all form from a common pool of reactive intermediates derived from similar precursors. Additionally, the fraction of 13C within each of these aromatic products (e.g. benzene) follows a binomial distribution as the reaction proceeds (Figure 5), which indicates that CC bonds are broken and re-formed many times in each precursor species in the time required for the formation of an aromatic molecule. The 13C distribution in the initial benzene product is shown in Table 2.

However, the initial 13C content in ethene is higher than in propene, suggesting that some of the ethene forms initially via direct cracking of labeled propane. The initial 13C fraction in ethene suggests that 38% of the ethene forms from the direct cracking of labeled propane (Table 3). The initial higher 13C content in butene than in propene shows that butene is formed from both ethene dimerization and from propene via chain growth and subsequent cracking, hence a 13C content between both 13C contents in ethene and propene.

These data give evidence for initial propane dehydrogenation and propane cracking but provide limited information about the chain growth of these alkene intermediates.
3.4. Formation and Scission of CarbonCarbon Bonds. Reactions of positionally labeled alkanes can be used to study the mechanism of cyclization reactions. 29-31 Specifically, the analysis of the content and location of 13C in the products of propane-2-13C reactions can establish the reaction pathways required for the conversion of propene intermediates to stable aromatic products. For example, a simple cyclization of two propene-2-13C molecules formed from propane-2-13C would lead to benzene-1,4-13C in the absence of intramolecular scrambling. In contrast, the formation and expected intramolecular isomerization of large chains as adsorbed alkoxide or cationic intermediates would lead to products with a random number and location of 13C-atoms.
Disappointingly, all information about the location and content of 13C-atoms in the propane-2-13C is lost during an aromatization turnover on HZSM5. Even at low conversion, all aromatic products of propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 show a binomial distribution of 13C-atoms, instead of the single isotopomer expected from propene dimerization and hexene cyclization (Figures 79). This binomial isotopomer distribution suggests that propane aromatization on HZSM5 involves rapid chain lengthening and shortening reactions and intramolecular methyl shifts, which break and re-form every CC bond many times in the time required for an aromatic turnover. Such a turnover requires the formation of C6 or larger molecules, a process that involves oligomerization reactions, but also a significant number of β-scission and methyl shift events. These oligomerization, β-scission and isomerization reactions quickly establish an alkene mixture that is independent of the size of the alkene reactants. 32,33 Both chain length and methyl group position appear to reach equilibrium values. The broad carbon number distribution within aromatic products of propane reactions on HZSM5 (Table 1) is also consistent with extensive CC bond formation and cleavage during aromatization reactions. These fast reactions lead to similar average 13C content and isotopomer distributions in all aromatic products, suggesting that these aromatic products form from a common pool of gas-phase and adsorbed alkenes.

Figure 9 13C distribution in xylenes formed from propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He).The 2-butene product shows a binomial distribution of 13C on HZSM5 (Figure 10). This distribution suggests that even at very low propane conversion (<6%) most of the carbons in 2-butene have undergone extensive CC bond breaking and making during oligomerization/cracking cycles, thusproducing a nearly binomial 2-butene 13C isotopomer distribution.Figure 10 13C distribution in 2-butene formed from propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He).At low conversions, ethene and ethane 13C distributions are not binomial and contain mostly one 13C (Figures 11 and 12). Initially, ethene is formed primarily from the direct cracking of propane-2-13C and not from oligomerization/cracking cycles, which would lead to a binomial 13C distribution in ethene. However, as conversion increases, ethene approaches a binomial 13C distribution, indicating that ethene is mostly formed from alkene cycles that break and re-form CC bonds. Reactions of propane-2-13C/propene mixtures, described in section 3.3, suggested that only a fraction of the initial ethene product came from direct cracking of propane-2-13C; this discrepancy arose because, with the addition of propene, a higher abundance of larger alkenes (from propene) are present at similar propane conversions. These large alkenes crack to dilute the 13C-ethene derived from propane-2-13C cracking, thus lowering the percentage of ethene formed from direct propane cracking at similar propane conversion. The ethene 13C enrichment from Figure 9, extrapolated to zero contact time, agrees with the fraction of 13C in ethene derived from pure propane-2-13C feeds.Figure 11 13C distribution in ethene formed from propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He, at 5.9, 11.7, and 35.7% propane conversion).Figure 12 13C distribution in ethane formed from propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He, at 5.9, 11.7, and 35.7% propane conversion).Similar to the ethene distribution, ethane initially contains mostly one 13C at low conversions (Figure 12). As conversion increases, the ethane isotopic distribution closely resembles that of ethene, suggesting that during propane conversion on HZSM5, ethane is formed by direct hydrogenation of ethene using H-atoms formed in CH bond activation steps.The initial propene 13C distribution formed on HZSM5 is also not binomially distributed and contains mostly one 13C from the direct dehydrogenation of propane-2-13C (Figure 13). As conversion increases, propene begins to acquire a binomial 13C distribution and forms increasingly in alkene cycles. The propane 13C distribution does not change much during reaction, up to about 35% conversion (Figure 14). It slowly begins to acquire multiple 13C atoms, primarily via hydrogenation of 13C scrambled propene, but, even at 35% propane conversion, the propane still contains >87% of the singly-labeled isotopomer suggesting that propane dehydrogenation/hydrogenation steps are not equilibrated.Figure 13 13C distribution in propene formed from propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He, at 5.9, 11.7, and 35.7% propane conversion).Figure 14 13C distribution in unreacted propane-2-13C on HZSM5 (773 K, 6.7 kPa C3H8-2-13C, 94.6 kPa He, at 5.9, 11.7, and 35.7% propane conversion).
3.5. Mechanism of Propane Aromatization on HZSM5 Zeolites. Propane reaction pathways have been extensively discussed in the literature primarily on the basis of observed effects of catalyst composition on reaction rate and selectivity.5-12 We have obtained more direct evidence for the sequence of steps using isotopic tracer and exchange methods. These methods have established the nature of individual reaction steps in this reaction sequence.
The reaction network shown in Scheme 4 is consistent with our results and with previous studies of acid-catalyzed reactions.5,6 Propene, initially formed via a dehydrogenation of propane, and ethene, initially formed from propane cracking, undergo rapid acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or by addition to C3+ carbocations formed directly from propane. These surface species undergo rapid methyl shift isomerization reactions; as the chain lengthens, β-scission reactions become faster and ultimately establish a pool of carbocation species and alkene intermediates with a broad size distribution. These alkene intermediates continue to undergo hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions, commonly described as hydrogen transfer, in which light alkenes accept hydrogen to form alkanes. C6+ alkenes tend to cyclize and further dehydrogenate to kinetically stable and thermodynamically favored aromatic products. Cracking of larger chains also occurs with the concomitant removal of hydrogen by its addition to light alkene products of cracking reactions. Propane aromatization on HZSM5 occurs via a complex sequence of dehydrogenation, oligomerization, β-scission, and cyclization steps (Scheme 4).

4. Conclusions
The results from the isotopic 13C labeling studies provide additional evidence for the propane reaction pathways suggested by previous researchers.5-7 These isotopic results suggest that propane aromatization occurs on HZSM5 by a complex reaction sequence, with a first step consisting of propane dehydrogenation to propene or propane cracking to ethene and methane (confirmed by reactions of propene/propane-2-13C mixtures). Reactions of propane-2-13C show that chain growth on HZSM5 involves rapid alkene oligomerization/cracking cycles. Stable products, such as aromatics, alkanes, and H2, exit this cycle via cyclization reactions and hydrogen transfer or desorption pathways (Scheme 4). These alkene reactions are necessary to explain the distribution of aromatic products. Products of propane-2-13C reactions on HZSM5 contain binomial distributions of 13C-atoms. Benzene products contain one to five 13C-atoms, instead of the two 13C-atoms expected from direct propene cyclodimerization. Reactions involve rapid oligomerization/cracking cycles of intermediate alkenes; such reactions break and re-form every CC bond many times during one aromatization turnover. Rapid oligomerization/cracking cycles and intervening methyl shifts lead to the same 13C content and to binomial 13C distributions in all aromatic products.
Along with aromatics, a small amount of hydrogen (H2) is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface. However, on HZSM5, the major hydrogen disposal pathway is by hydrogen-transfer reactions, which lead to the use of carbonaceous intermediates as stoichiometric sinks for the removal of the hydrogen species formed in sequential dehydrogenation steps.
