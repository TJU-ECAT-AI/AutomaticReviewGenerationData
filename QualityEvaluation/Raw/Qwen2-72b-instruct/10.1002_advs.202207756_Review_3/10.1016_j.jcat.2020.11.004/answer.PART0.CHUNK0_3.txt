[1] "Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 by in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy"
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as a promising catalyst for nonoxidative dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes."
[3] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."
[4] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."
[5] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."
[6] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[7] "Using water as a probe molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same conditions."
[8] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

1.The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.镓/铝比、硅/铝比和框架铝对的密度对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，有影响。较低的硅/铝比的催化剂更可能形成镓氢化物，而较高的硅/铝比的催化剂则不太可能。可以形成镓氢化物的镓物种是那些与配对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)交换形成Ga+H+对位点的物种，而那些与孤立BAS交换的形成孤立Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+物种在150 C下很容易被水氧化形成GaOOH物种，而Ga+H+对位点在相同的条件下是不活跃的。这些发现表明，这两种类型的镓物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。
