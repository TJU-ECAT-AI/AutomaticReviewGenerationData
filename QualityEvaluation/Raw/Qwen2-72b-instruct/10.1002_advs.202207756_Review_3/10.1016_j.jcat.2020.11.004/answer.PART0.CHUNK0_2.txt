[1] "Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 by in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy"
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as a promising catalyst for nonoxidative dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes."
[3] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."
[4] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."
[5] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."
[6] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[7] "Using water as a probe molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same conditions."
[8] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

1.The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to be Ga+H+ pair sites, while those on catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are more likely to be isolated Ga+ sites. The gallium hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. This reveals that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the density and distribution of framework aluminum pairs, plays a crucial role in determining the nature and activity of the gallium species in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

1.在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，包括镓氢化物在内的镓物种受Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在Si/Al比较低的催化剂上，更可能形成Ga+H+对位点，而在Si/Al比较高的催化剂上，更可能形成孤立的Ga+位点。镓氢化物只能在Ga+H+对位点上形成，而不能在孤立的Ga+位点上形成。这表明催化剂的结构，特别是框架铝对的密度和分布，在决定丙烷脱氢反应中镓物种的性质和活性方面起着关键作用。
