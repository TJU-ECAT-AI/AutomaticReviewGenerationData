[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[3] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1)."
[4] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."
[5] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
[6] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
[7] "Meanwhile, at lower Si/ Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites. We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."
[8] "This hypothesis agrees with the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation."
[9] "For samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites,as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low Ga loadings."

1.The gallium species formed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties.

1.镓改性沸石催化剂中形成的镓物种受到Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在较低的Si/Al比下，成对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)更为普遍，导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原过程中能够形成镓氢化物(GaHx)。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比下，BAS主要是孤立的，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与成对BAS的存在相关，成对BAS在较低的Si/Al比下更为丰富。这些关系揭示，催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在决定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用。Ga+H+对位点与孤立Ga+物种的存在可能对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响，因为它们可能表现出不同的催化性能。
