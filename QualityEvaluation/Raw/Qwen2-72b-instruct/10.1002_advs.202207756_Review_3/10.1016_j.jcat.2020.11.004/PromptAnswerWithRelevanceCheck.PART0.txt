[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[3] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1)."
[4] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."
[5] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
[6] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
[7] "Meanwhile, at lower Si/ Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites. We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."
[8] "This hypothesis agrees with the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation."
[9] "For samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites,as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low Ga loadings."

1.The gallium species formed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties.

1.镓改性沸石催化剂中形成的镓物种受到Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在较低的Si/Al比下，成对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)更为普遍，导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原过程中能够形成镓氢化物(GaHx)。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比下，BAS主要是孤立的，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与成对BAS的存在相关，成对BAS在较低的Si/Al比下更为丰富。这些关系揭示，催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在决定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用。Ga+H+对位点与孤立Ga+物种的存在可能对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响，因为它们可能表现出不同的催化性能。

[1] "Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 by in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy"
[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as a promising catalyst for nonoxidative dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes."
[3] "However, Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."
[4] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (0–1.7)."
[5] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."
[6] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[7] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[8] "The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized development of other PDH catalysts."
[9] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research."
[10] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques."
[11] "The BAS densities of the samples were 636, 460, 281 μmol/g for samples with Si/Al ratios of 15, 28 and 39, respectively."
[12] "Upon reduction with H2 (1 atm) at 550 °C, the BAS band (3591 cm−1) disappears (Fig. 1(ii)), indicating the replacement of BAS by Ga species."
[13] "Quantitative FTIR experiments with pyridine show that not all BAS can be exchanged by Ga species even at Ga/Al ratios up to 1.7 during the reduction treatment."
[14] "The integrated area of the pyridinium band decreases by 75% as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 0.7 (Fig. 3a(i-xii)), and then levels off at 80% at higher Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 3a(xiii-xv))."
[15] "The consumption of BAS increases with Ga/Al ratio and reached about 70% for samples with Ga/Al ratios near unity."
[16] "The highest percentage of BAS consumption in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios is similar (80%), suggesting a thermodynamic barrier rather than a purely diffusional one to achieve complete BAS replacement."
[17] "Ga speciation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is also found to depend on the Ga/Al ratio."
[18] "The dependence of the formation and relative abundance of the gallium hydride species formed upon reduction on the Ga/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios provides another dimension to differentiate different Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
[19] "The bands for these Ga-H stretching modes generally blueshift as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1) cools down under vacuum (Fig. S8), which explains the slight shifts of the hydride bands reported in this work compared to those by Hensen and coworkers."
[20] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56."
[21] "A discernable GaH band does not appear until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.08, and disappears at Ga/Al ratios above 0.7."
[22] "The combined peak area of Ga hydrides as a function of the Ga/Al ratio is plotted in Fig. 6; this combined area is dominated by the GaH2 band, due to its higher intensity."
[23] "The intensity of Ga hydride bands decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of H-ZSM-5 at the same Ga/Al ratio."
[24] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS."
[25] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."
[26] "The dependence of the GaHx formation on the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite (Fig. 5), i.e., the BAS density, suggests that the environment of BAS has an impact on the properties of the exchanged Ga species."
[27] "Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework."
[28] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated."
[29] "Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
[30] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 °C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
[31] "Meanwhile, at lower Si/Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites."
[32] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation."
[33] "This hypothesis agrees with the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation."
[34] "For samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites, as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low Ga loadings."
[35] "IR spectra collected after introducing water vapor to reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of exchanged Ga species."
[36] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 after H2 treatment at 550 °C is quickly cooled down to 150 °C under vacuum (within 30 min)."
[37] "Upon water introduction to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 °C, an intense band centered at 2052 cm−1 appears (red trace of Fig. 7a(ix)), completely masking the GaHx bands in the same spectral range."
[38] "Introduction of water to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 °C leads to the production of H2, in agreement with water acting as an oxidant."
[39] "Based on literature precedents and the water introduction reaction results, we assign the band at 2052 cm−1 to GaOOH."
[40] "Interestingly, introduction of water to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with lower Ga/Al ratios (0.13) has a much less pronounced impact than those observed on samples with higher Ga/Al ratios."
[41] "In particular, the GaH band on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042) barely changes after water introduction (black and red traces of Fig. 7a(i))."
[42] "These observations suggest that the Ga species is different at low Ga/Al ratios (0.13) and high Ga loadings, supporting our hypothesis of two distinct exchanged Ga species."
[43] "Importantly, the threshold Ga/Al ratio (0.13) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at which this transition occurs coincides with the point at which the combined GaHx band area levels off as Ga loading increases (Fig. 6), indicating that the same change in Ga speciation is likely responsible for changes in the trends of both GaHx and GaOOH bands."
[44] "It follows that GaHx species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 °C (Ga/Al ratio ≥ 0.13) do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 °C, and only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized."
[45] "Although no detectable GaHx band is observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) after reduction at 550 °C (Fig. 5c), GaHx bands appear after the sample is cooled to 150 °C under vacuum (black traces of Fig. 7b), which is similar to that on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), as shown in black traces of Fig. 7a."
[46] "In line with this observation, for the lowest Ga/Al ratio investigated (0.12) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39), water introduction hardly has an effect on the spectra (Fig. 7b(i))."
[47] "The GaOOH band after water introduction grows with the Ga/Al ratio on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39), which is consistent with results on samples with a lower Si/Al ratio of 15 (Fig. 7)."
[48] "Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 °C."
[49] "The hypothesis that the exchanged Ga species exist in two distinct environments (isolated and paired with a neighboring proton), together with the spectral features observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), lead to the prediction that water does not react with GaHx at 150 °C."
[50] "H-D exchange experiments were conducted to probe the reactivity of GaHx with water."
[51] "The FTIR spectra of the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39, Ga/Al = 1) at 150 °C shows a positive and a negative peaks at 3740 and 3605 cm−1 (Fig. 9a(i)), which can be attributed to the partial restoration of external silanol groups and consumed BAS upon reduction and Ga exchange with BAS, respectively, as discussed previously (Fig. 1)."
[52] "Weak but distinct GaH2 and GaH band centered at 2040 and 2060 cm−1, respectively, are also present (Fig. 9b(i))."
[53] "Upon introduction of H2O (1000 mTorr), a board band spanning 2040–2060 cm−1 appears, corresponding to the formation of GaOOH (Fig. 9b(ii))."
[54] "The broad width of this band makes it difficult to discern whether GaHx bands remain."
[55] "D2O is subsequently introduced (1000 mTorr), leading to the appearance of the SiO-D bands at 2600–2800 cm−1 via the H-D exchange."
[56] "The broad band at 2040–2060 cm−1 largely disappears (Fig. 9b(iii)) while a similarly broad band at 1476 cm−1 appears (Fig. 9c(iii)), attributable to GaOOD due to the H-D exchange."
[57] "Importantly, the band at 2060 cm−1 (and to a lesser degree the 2040 cm−1 band) remains after the introduction of excess of D2O (Fig. 9b(iii)), indicating the presence of GaHx."
[58] "This results confirms the prediction that GaHx does not react with water at 150 °C; proposed based on the lack of change of GaHx bands upon water introduction for samples with low Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 7a(i) and b(i))."
[59] "Reintroduction of H2O in excess is able to largely replace the SiOD and GaOOD bands with SiOH and GaOOH bands, respectively (Fig. 9(iv))."
[60] "Additional spectroscopic investigations confirm that Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 °C, further confirming that these two Ga species possess distinct properties."
[61] "To avoid the complication of having both Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042) is used to investigate the ability of Ga+H+ pair to react with water, as we have shown that this sample has a negligible concentration of isolated Ga+ sites (Fig. 7a(i))."
[62] "Two independent sets of experiments were conducted in which the Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042), after H2 treatment at 550 °C, was either directly cooled to 150 °C under vacuum or cooled to 150 °C after undergoing 30 min of annealing at 600 °C under vacuum."
[63] "Based on the observed slow decomposition of GaHx species at 550 °C in vacuum (Fig. S10), annealing at 600 °C is expected to more effectively convert GaHx species to Ga+H+ pair sites."
[64] "This is confirmed by the much weaker GaHx bands on the annealed sample than those of the sample without annealing (Fig. 10a(iii) and a(i), respectively), as shown in schematically in Fig. 10b."
[65] "Thus, a significant fraction of Ga+ species in the sample after annealing are present in the form of Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than GaHx."
[66] "No detectable change is observed upon water introduction to both samples at 150 °C, indicating that the Ga+H+ pair is unreactive with water under this condition (Fig. 10a(ii) and a(iv), and Fig. 10b)."
[67] "This is in stark contrast with the isolated Ga+ species, which readily form GaOOH when exposed to water at 150 °C."
[68] "This result then verifies that the reactivity of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are quite different."
[69] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon exposure to H2 at 550 °C and water at 150 °C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH, which will the subject of study in a future work."

1.The gallium/aluminum (Ga/Al) ratio, silicon/aluminum (Si/Al) ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. The gallium speciation varies with the basic acid site (BAS) density in the zeolite, which is dependent on the Si/Al ratio. At low Si/Al ratios, paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with gallium (Ga+), leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites. At high Si/Al ratios, isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The gallium hydride species (GaHx) formation is dependent on the Si/Al ratio, with higher densities of paired BAS at lower Si/Al ratios facilitating the formation of GaHx species. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium speciation, which is dependent on the BAS density and the Ga/Al ratio.

Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.

1.镓改性沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。GaHx带，代表镓氢化物，取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，表明镓物种的变化与沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度有关。成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下，孤立的Ga+位点不能形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种。在Si/Al比高的样品上，大多数BAS是孤立的，导致孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150°C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150°C下不能与水反应，进一步证实这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受镓物种形成的影响，而这些镓物种的形成依赖于Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度。
