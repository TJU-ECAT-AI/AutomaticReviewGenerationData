[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[3] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
[4] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
[5] "Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation."
[6] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 after H2 treatment at 550 C is quickly cooled down to 150 C under vacuum (within 30 min)."
[7] "Introduction of water to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C leads to the production of H2,in agreement with water acting as an oxidant."
[8] "GaHx species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C (Ga/Al ratio  0.13) do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, and only isolated Ga+ species are oxi- dized."
[9] "Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C."
[10] "Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two Ga species possess dis- tinct properties."

1.The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.

1.镓改性沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。GaHx带，代表镓氢化物，取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，表明镓物种的变化与沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度有关。成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下，孤立的Ga+位点不能形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种。在Si/Al比高的样品上，大多数BAS是孤立的，导致孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150°C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150°C下不能与水反应，进一步证实这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受镓物种形成的影响，而这些镓物种的形成依赖于Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度。
