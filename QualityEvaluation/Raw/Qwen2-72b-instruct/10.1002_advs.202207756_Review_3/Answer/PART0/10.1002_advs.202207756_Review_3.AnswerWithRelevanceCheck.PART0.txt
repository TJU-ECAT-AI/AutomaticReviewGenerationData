          [1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
          [2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."
          [3] "In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
          [4] "These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
          [5] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
          [6] "When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
          [7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
          [8] "Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110]"
          [9] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."
          [10] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."
          [11] "A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 9a)."
          [12] "TOFAl on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y) increased almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55, before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios (Figure 9a)."

          The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the formation of gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. The discrepancy between the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS indicates that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). The ratio of the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak to the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ is identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), showing a linear correlation between the density of framework Al pairs and the amount of GaHx. When Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite. Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between the densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species suggests that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species. Ga2O22+ is the most active propane dehydrogenation (PDH) species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Pulse titration results reveal three types of Ga species on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The turnover frequency normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) increases rapidly at low Ga loadings up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.05, then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, and declines as the Ga/Al ratio increases further. A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

          在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，代表镓氢化物形成的GaHx带的强度最初随Ga/Al比的增加而增加，在Ga/Al比为0.1时达到稳定，然后在Ga/Al比超过0.56时下降。这种趋势在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上是相似的，但最大强度较低。Ga交换消耗的Brønsted酸位点(BAS)在两种样品中Ga/Al比超过0.7时才停止。GaHx形成和BAS消耗之间的差异表明，并非所有Ga阳离子物种在还原时都能形成Ga氢化物。这与Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上缺乏GaHx一致。Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)和Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上GaHx峰的最大积分面积与Co2+对应的UVvis带的比率在实验误差范围内相同，显示了框架Al对的密度和GaHx量之间的线性相关性。当Ga被支撑在(部分)Co2+交换的H-ZSM-5 (15)上时，GaHx带的强度与沸石中交换的Co2+量成反比。由于只有框架Al对才能稳定二价阳离子物种，框架Al对密度和GaHx物种密度之间的相关性表明GaHx的前体可能是二价阳离子物种。Ga2O22+是Ga/H-ZSM-5上最活跃的丙烷脱氢(PDH)物种。脉冲滴定结果揭示了三种类型的Ga物种存在于还原催化剂上：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚物。在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，归一化到沸石中Al量的周转频率(TOFAl)在低Ga负载下迅速增加，直到Ga/Al比为0.05，然后随着Ga/Al比上升到0.3而缓慢增长，在Ga/Al比进一步增加时下降。在Si/Al比为28的样品上观察到PDH速率对Ga/Al比的依赖性具有类似的三段式。在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上，TOFAl几乎线性增加到Ga/Al比为0.55，然后在更高的Ga/Al比下下降。Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和Ga改性沸石催化剂中框架铝对密度之间的这些关系影响了活性镓物种，包括镓氢化物的形成和性质，并揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。
