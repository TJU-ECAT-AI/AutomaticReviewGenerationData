The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples.

The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.\n          The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties.

The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties.\n          The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.\n          The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.", "Chinese": "镓改性沸石催化剂中形成的镓物种受到Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在较低的Si/Al比下，成对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)更为普遍，导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原过程中能够形成镓氢化物(GaHx)。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比下，BAS主要是孤立的，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与成对BAS的存在相关，成对BAS在较低的Si/Al比下更为丰富。这些关系揭示，催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在决定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用。Ga+H+对位点与孤立Ga+物种的存在可能对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响，因为它们可能表现出不同的催化性能。\n          Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在Si/Al比较低的催化剂上，更可能形成镓氢化物，而Si/Al比较高的催化剂则不太可能。可以形成镓氢化物的镓物种是那些与配对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)交换形成Ga+H+对位点的物种，而那些与孤立BAS交换的形成孤立Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+物种在150 C下很容易被水氧化形成GaOOH物种，而Ga+H+对位点在相同的条件下是不活跃的。这些发现表明，这两种类型的镓物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。\n          镓改性沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。GaHx带，代表镓氢化物，取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，表明镓物种的变化与沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度有关。成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下，孤立的Ga+位点不能形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种。在Si/Al比高的样品上，大多数BAS是孤立的，导致孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150°C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150°C下不能与水反应，进一步证实这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受镓物种形成的影响，而这些镓物种的形成依赖于Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios.

The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties.\n          The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.\n          The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.", "Chinese": "镓改性沸石催化剂中形成的镓物种受到Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在较低的Si/Al比下，成对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)更为普遍，导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原过程中能够形成镓氢化物(GaHx)。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比下，BAS主要是孤立的，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与成对BAS的存在相关，成对BAS在较低的Si/Al比下更为丰富。这些关系揭示，催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在决定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用。Ga+H+对位点与孤立Ga+物种的存在可能对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响，因为它们可能表现出不同的催化性能。\n          Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在Si/Al比较低的催化剂上，更可能形成镓氢化物，而Si/Al比较高的催化剂则不太可能。可以形成镓氢化物的镓物种是那些与配对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)交换形成Ga+H+对位点的物种，而那些与孤立BAS交换的形成孤立Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+物种在150 C下很容易被水氧化形成GaOOH物种，而Ga+H+对位点在相同的条件下是不活跃的。这些发现表明，这两种类型的镓物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。\n          镓改性沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。GaHx带，代表镓氢化物，取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，表明镓物种的变化与沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度有关。成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下，孤立的Ga+位点不能形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种。在Si/Al比高的样品上，大多数BAS是孤立的，导致孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150°C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150°C下不能与水反应，进一步证实这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受镓物种形成的影响，而这些镓物种的形成依赖于Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.", "Chinese": "在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，代表镓氢化物形成的GaHx带的强度最初随Ga/Al比的增加而增加，在Ga/Al比为0.1时达到稳定，然后在Ga/Al比超过0.56时下降。这种趋势在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上是相似的，但最大强度较低。Ga交换消耗的Brønsted酸位点(BAS)在两种样品中Ga/Al比超过0.7时才停止。GaHx形成和BAS消耗之间的差异表明，并非所有Ga阳离子物种在还原时都能形成Ga氢化物。这与Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上缺乏GaHx一致。Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)和Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y)上GaHx峰的最大积分面积与Co2+对应的UVvis带的比率在实验误差范围内相同，显示了框架Al对的密度和GaHx量之间的线性相关性。当Ga被支撑在(部分)Co2+交换的H-ZSM-5 (15)上时，GaHx带的强度与沸石中交换的Co2+量成反比。由于只有框架Al对才能稳定二价阳离子物种，框架Al对密度和GaHx物种密度之间的相关性表明GaHx的前体可能是二价阳离子物种。Ga2O22+是Ga/H-ZSM-5上最活跃的丙烷脱氢(PDH)物种。脉冲滴定结果揭示了三种类型的Ga物种存在于还原催化剂上：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚物。在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)上，归一化到沸石中Al量的周转频率(TOFAl)在低Ga负载下迅速增加，直到Ga/Al比为0.05，然后随着Ga/Al比上升到0.3而缓慢增长，在Ga/Al比进一步增加时下降。在Si/Al比为28的样品上观察到PDH速率对Ga/Al比的依赖性具有类似的三段式。在Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)上，TOFAl几乎线性增加到Ga/Al比为0.55，然后在更高的Ga/Al比下下降。Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和Ga改性沸石催化剂中框架铝对密度之间的这些关系影响了活性镓物种，包括镓氢化物的形成和性质，并揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。", "Doi": "10.1002/advs.202207756_3"},
