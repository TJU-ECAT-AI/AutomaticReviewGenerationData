[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."
          [2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."
          [3] "In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
          [4] "These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."

          [5] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
          [6] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."

          [2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."
          [3] "In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a)."
          [4] "These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y)."
          [5] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."
          [6] "When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection."
          [7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."
          [8] "Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110]"
          [9] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."
          [10] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."
          [11] "A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 9a)."
          [12] "TOFAl on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y) increased almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55, before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios (Figure 9a)."

[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
          [2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
          [3] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1)."
          [4] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."
          [5] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
          [6] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
          [7] "Meanwhile, at lower Si/ Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites. We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."
          [8] "This hypothesis agrees with the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation."
          [9] "For samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites,as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low Ga loadings."

          [12] "Using water as a probe molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same conditions."
          [13] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
