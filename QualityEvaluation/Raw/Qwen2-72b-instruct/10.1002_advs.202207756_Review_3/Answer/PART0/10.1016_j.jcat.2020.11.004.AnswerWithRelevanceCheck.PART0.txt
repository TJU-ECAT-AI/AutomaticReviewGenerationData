          [1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
          [2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
          [3] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1)."
          [4] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."
          [5] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with neighboring BAS."
          [6] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM- 5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C (under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere)."
          [7] "Meanwhile, at lower Si/ Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites. We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec- troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."
          [8] "This hypothesis agrees with the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation."
          [9] "For samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites,as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low Ga loadings."
          [10] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
          [11] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
          [12] "Using water as a probe molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same conditions."
          [13] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
          [14] "The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs."
          [15] "The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so."
          [16] "The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
          [17] "The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions."

          [23] "The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite."

          [26] "On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species."
          [27] "The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized."
          [28] "Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C."
          [29] "Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties."

          The gallium species formed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties.
          The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
          The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized.

Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.

          镓改性沸石催化剂中形成的镓物种受到Ga/Al比、Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在较低的Si/Al比下，成对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)更为普遍，导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原过程中能够形成镓氢化物(GaHx)。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比下，BAS主要是孤立的，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与成对BAS的存在相关，成对BAS在较低的Si/Al比下更为丰富。这些关系揭示，催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在决定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用。Ga+H+对位点与孤立Ga+物种的存在可能对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响，因为它们可能表现出不同的催化性能。
          Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。在Si/Al比较低的催化剂上，更可能形成镓氢化物，而Si/Al比较高的催化剂则不太可能。可以形成镓氢化物的镓物种是那些与配对的布伦斯特酸位点(BAS)交换形成Ga+H+对位点的物种，而那些与孤立BAS交换的形成孤立Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+物种在150 C下很容易被水氧化形成GaOOH物种，而Ga+H+对位点在相同的条件下是不活跃的。这些发现表明，这两种类型的镓物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。
          镓改性沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度的影响。GaHx带，代表镓氢化物，取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，表明镓物种的变化与沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度有关。成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下，孤立的Ga+位点不能形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种。在Si/Al比高的样品上，大多数BAS是孤立的，导致孤立的Ga+物种。在550°C下处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150°C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150°C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150°C下不能与水反应，进一步证实这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受镓物种形成的影响，而这些镓物种的形成依赖于Ga/Al比，Si/Al比和框架铝对密度。
