{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites that can form stable gallium hydrides. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable gallium hydrides at high temperatures. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, with Ga+H+ pair sites being more active in propane dehydrogenation due to their ability to form gallium hydrides. The gallium species' formation and properties are directly related to the density and distribution of BAS in the zeolite, highlighting the critical role of zeolite composition in determining the nature and reactivity of active gallium species.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

The density of framework Al pairs linearly correlates with GaHx species, suggesting divalent cationic species as GaHx precursors. Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species. PDH rates show a three-segment dependence on Ga/Al ratio, with rapid increases at low ratios, slower growth, and decline at higher ratios, consistent across Si/Al ratios.
