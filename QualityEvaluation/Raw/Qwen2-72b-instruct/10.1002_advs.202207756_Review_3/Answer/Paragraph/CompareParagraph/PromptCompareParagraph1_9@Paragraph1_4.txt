The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation.[127, 128] As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit. On reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5(39, Y) at 550 °C, the GaHx band (2037 and 2053 cm−1) was absent regardless of the Ga/Al ratio, supporting the correlation between GaHx and framework Al pairs. The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c). A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y). In contrast, the consumption of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction did not stop until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples (Figure 7a). These diverging trends in the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS show that not all cationic Ga species are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction, which is also consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UV&ndash;vis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx. When Ga was supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band was inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite (Figure 7e,f), further supporting this connection. Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g).
The composition of the divalent cationic Ga species was deducted by the amount of oxygen needed to fully oxidize reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 via a quantitative pulse titration method.[54] In a typical experiment (Figure 8a), the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7) with 10 vol% H2/N2 at 550 °C led to significant H2O formation, evidencing the reduction of the supported Ga2O3, and the subsequent O2 pulses oxidizing reduced Ga species. Determination of the amounts of H2O formed during the reduction and O2 consumed in the subsequent oxidation provide direct evidence for the change in the oxidation state of Ga species in the reduced and oxidized sample. The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction, and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 0&ndash;1.7) was ≈1.5 (Figure 8b). This confirmed that Ga2O3 in as-synthesized samples was mostly reduced to Ga+ during the reduction process (Ga2O3 + 2 H+Z− + 2 H2 → 2 Ga+Z− + 3 H2O, H2O/Ga = 1.5).[77] Then Ga+ was oxidized to Ga3+ species by oxygen pulses (O/Ga = 1).
Three important features were observed in the pulse titration results (Figure 8c): i) On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), no appreciable amount of water or oxygen was formed or consumed, respectively, indicating that Ga species in this sample could not be reduced by H2. The oxidation of Ga in this sample remains +3 after the H2 treatment at 550 °C, as in the as-synthesized sample. ii) As the Ga/BAS ratio increased to 0.7, O consumption rose almost linearly with a Ga/O ratio of unity, that is, the majority of Ga3+ was reduced to Ga+ after H2 treatment within this Ga/BAS range. iii) Further increase in the Ga loading did not lead to an increase in the O2 consumption, suggesting the presence of a different, redox-inactive, GaOx species. This is consistent with the observation that no additional BAS was exchanged in this region, and with the high reduction temperature of Ga2O3.[116]
Pulse titration results on Ga supported on Co-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, Y)), in which all framework Al pairs were occupied by Co2+, were similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM (15, Y) except for a key feature (Figure 8d,e): there was no redox inactive Ga species at very low Ga loading in Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.05), in contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042). This indicates that the redox inactive Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) occupy framework Al pair sites, and is a divalent cation with Ga in the oxidation state of +3. Considering the 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the only possible composition of the redox-inactive Ga species is Ga2O22+.[54] Based on the titration results, ≈10% of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were exchanged with Ga2O22+ (Figure 8c), which was lower than the density of Al pairs determined by the Co2+ exchange method (≈35%). This discrepancy was rationalized by the fact that there is no clear-cut definition for framework Al pairs, that is, the cutoff distance between two framework Al atoms beyond which they were not considered “a pair.” This is similar to the NNN and NNNN sites proposed by Phadke et al.[100] It is likely that the cutoff distance is different for different divalent cations, leading to different exchange capacities of Co2+ and Ga2O22+.
Ga2O22+ as a catalytic PDH site in Ga/H-ZSM-5 was first proposed by Hensen and co-workers in a different context. Enhanced PDH activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 was observed when steam was co-fed with propane, and the Ga2O22+ moiety was proposed based on the fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra.[129] As discussed above, the validity of structures of Ga species based on XAS analysis was recently called into question.[119] DFT calculations indicated that the key difference between Ga+ and Ga2O22+ was the stability of their oxidized form, that is, [GaO]+ and Ga2O22+, in the reducing environment at high temperatures. The [GaO]+ sites can be easily reduced to [Ga]+ at high temperatures; while Ga2O22+ species could dissociate H2 to form two isolated [HGa3+OH]+ interacting via a hydrogen bond, which exhibited lower activation energy for H2 recombination compared to isolated [HGa3+OH]+ (147 vs 242 kJ mol−1).[130, 131] This is consistent with the pulse titration results (Figure 8) that Ga+ is redox-active while Ga2O22+ cannot be reduced by H2 at 550 °C.[54] Ga2O22+ was calculated to be the most stable Ga species around framework Al pairs in MOR zeolites;[130] a similar calculation in MFI has yet to be reported.
Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110] Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a). A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 9a). TOFAl on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y) increased almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55, before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios (Figure 9a). These trends are in general agreement with the results reported by Bell and co-workers (Figure 6h, Si/Al = 16.5)[76] and Lercher and co-workers (Figure 5a, Si/Al = 50).[77] It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios.
The intrinsic reaction rates of Ga sites were estimated by determining the slope between TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at different Ga/Al ratio ranges, which represented the TOF normalized per unit of added Ga (TOFGa). On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the slope of the TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at Ga/Al ratios below 0.042 was 0.60 ± 0.09 molC3H8 molGa−1 s−1 (Figure 9b). TOFGa decreased to 0.04 ± 0.01 in the Ga/Al ratio range of 0.042 to 0.21, smaller than that in the lower Ga/Al range by a factor of ≈15, confirming two Ga sites with distinct PDH activities. Similarly, for samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28, TOFGa was 0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.04 ± 0.02 molC3H8 molGa−1 s−1 in the Ga/Al ratio range of 0&ndash;0.15 and 0.15&ndash;0.46, respectively. On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 39, TOFGa was already low (0.05 ± 0.01 molC3H8 molGa−1 s−1) at the lowest Ga loading evaluated (Figure 9b). It is noteworthy that the TOFGa was similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.15-0.46), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0-0.55); this implies that the same type of Ga species was introduced in all three samples in their respective Ga/Al ratio ranges. Pulse titration results showed that Ga+ was introduced in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042-0.21), implying that Ga+ was responsible for the measured TOFGa of ≈0.04 molC3H8 molGa−1 s−1. In the low Ga loading range, the integrated area of the GaHx band grew with the PDH rate in both Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 9c). The ratio between the integrated area of the GaHx band and TOFGa in the low Ga loading range was identical within experimental errors in both samples (Figure 11c,d). Spectroscopic and titration results discussed above indicate that GaHx could only form on Ga2O22+ (Figures 8 and 9). The heterolytic activation of H2 on Ga2O22+ likely leads to [H-GaOGa(OH)]2+, which is consistent with the absence of [GaD2]+ species (Figure 4c,d).
In addition to Ga/H-ZSM-5, Ga exchanged on CHA[56] has also been studied. Lobo and co-workers[56] investigated the Ga speciation and PDH of Ga/H-CHA and found that only extra-framework Ga+ sites were formed upon reduction of Ga/H-CHA catalyst, independent of Si/Al ratios. Isolated Ga+ sites reacted reversibly with H2 to form GaHx (2034 cm−1) at 150 °C and decomposed at high temperatures (550 °C). Thus, it remained unclear whether the GaHx band on Ga/H-CHA corresponded to Ga2O22+ as in Ga/H-ZSM-5. The absence of Ga2O22+ in Ga/H-CHA at a high temperature suggested that the framework could not stabilize Ga2O22+ at reaction conditions, which agreed with the much lower TOFGa on Ga/H-CHA (Table 1).[56] Correlations between GaHx versus Ga/Al ratio, as well as PDH rate versus Ga/Al ratio, implied that extra-framework Ga+ was more likely the active center catalyzing PDH.
Lercher and co-workers[132] recently reported a highly selective Ga-modified BEA zeolite catalyst for PDH with 82% selectivity for propylene at 19% propane conversion. The active sites have been identified as dehydrated and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in the *BEA framework. Detailed kinetic analysis indicated the different RDS at different propane partial pressures: PDH rate was determined by the first CH bond cleavage at low propane partial pressures, while the rate was limited by the H2 desorption at high propane partial pressures.
2.2 Gallium's Role in PDH Mechanism
To date, proposed PDH mechanisms on Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be broadly categorized into carbenium and alkyl mechanisms.[76, 77, 133, 134] The carbenium mechanism claims that C3H8 is initially activated on the BAS to form a carbenium ion, and the role of Ga is to facilitate the recombination of the H atom on the catalyst surface to form H2, thereby increasing the reaction rate.[133, 134] Meanwhile, Ga species activate C3H8 directly with the formation of Ga-C3H7 as the intermediate in the alkyl mechanism, followed by the β-H elimination of Ga-C3H7 to form C3H6 and Ga-H species, and closed by the desorption of H2 via proton transfer.[76, 77] In this section, we discuss the experimental and computational evidence supporting the two mechanisms.
2.2.1 Carbenium Mechanism
Iglesia and co-workers reported that the presence of Ga led to the increase of the propane turnover rates and the decrease of the cracking selectivity compared to H-ZSM-5,[99, 133-136] and attributed this enhancement to Ga's role of re-combinative desorption of H atoms formed in the dehydrogenation steps. The dependence of cracking selectivity (or methane selectivity) on H2 partial pressure determined on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 showed contrasting trends (Figure 10a). H-ZSM-5 showed a high selectivity for cracking, attributed to the catalyst's limited capacity for removing hydrogen adatoms produced in the dehydrogenation to form gas phase H2. The accumulating hydrogen adatoms led to high surface hydrogen fugacity, and thus drove the formation of methane, the most H-rich hydrocarbon, via cracking.[133] Recombinative desorption of H adatoms and dissociative adsorption of H2 are the same reaction in opposite directions. The inability of H-ZSM-5 to facilitate this equilibrium decouples the surface reactions from the H2 partial pressure, leading to the lack of H2 partial pressure dependence of methane selectivity. In contrast, the cracking selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 increased along with the H2 partial pressure (Figure 10a). Ga species were proposed to function as a “porthole” between the adsorbed H adatoms and the gas phase H2, that is, establishing the equilibrium between adsorbed H and gas phase H2. Thus, higher H2 partial pressure led to higher surface H fugacity, which favors the cracking pathway.
H-D scrambling experiments provided additional insights into Ga's role in the PDH mechanism.[133, 135, 136] Mixtures of C3H8 and C3D8 were employed to measure the CH activation rate by determining the rate of H-D scrambling. Similar rates were determined on both H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 10b), suggesting a similar ability for CH activation on both catalysts. Importantly, measured rates for CH activation were significantly higher than PDH by a factor of ≈20 for H-ZSM-5 and of ≈10 for Ga/H-ZSM-5,[135] which were interpreted as evidence for the PDH mechanism involving a pseudo-equilibrated CH activation step followed by the rate-determining H2 desorption. Similar observations were reported on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Co/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, suggesting the generality of this mechanism on metal-exchanged catalysts.[95, 135-137] However, CH activation in H-D scrambling may not proceed via the same mechanism or involve the same reaction intermediates as in PDH, for example, the H-D exchange of methane was proposed to occur on acid sites in zeolites without the need for complete scission of the CH bond.[138, 139] Moreover, H-D scrambling occurred on a Pt-based single-atom catalyst below 200 °C, which was more than 300 °C lower than the PDH temperature.[42]
The central tenet of the carbenium mechanism involves the rapid formation of a [C3H7]+ intermediate and slow H2 desorption.[133, 140] For both H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5, propane is initially activated by H+ to form the carbenium ion, followed by β-H elimination to release propylene and hydrogen. The latter step is accelerated by the presence of Ga species. Although the active Ga species in the zeolite remains debated,[54, 55, 76, 102, 133] including isolated Ga+ and [GaH]2+ and [Ga2O2]2+, similar mechanisms to those proposed by Iglesia and co-workers could be envisioned on these proposed active structures, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

2.2.2 Alkyl Mechanism
Different from the carbocation intermediate and H2 desorption RDS in the carbenium mechanism, Bell and co-workers proposed that the activation of the CH bond in propane leading to the formation of [C3H7-GaH]+ was the RDS in PDH.[76] The ratio of dehydrogenation to cracking (D/C) was independent of C3H8 or H2 partial pressure (Figure 11a,b), which was interpreted as evidence for both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions occurring on the same active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and involving the same surface intermediate, that is, [C3H7-GaH]+. Negative reaction orders of H2 were determined resulting in both dehydrogenation and cracking reactions (Figure 11c,d), consistent with previous results,[133] with the inhibition more severe at lower propane partial pressures. It was proposed that H2 competed with C3H8 for adsorption on the active sites ([GaH]2+), and the inhibition became weaker at higher propane partial pressure due to the strong interaction between the alkyl and active Ga species. The mechanism proposed by Lercher and co-workers, based primarily on computational results, is consistent with key aspects of the alkyl mechanism, though the assumed structure of active sites is different.[77]
The competitive adsorption of C3H8 and H2 on active Ga species was supported by Xu and co-workers' investigations using in situ FTIR spectroscopy.[55] Upon hydrogen reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 550 °C, GaHx bands appeared at 2037 cm−1 with a shoulder at 2053 cm−1 (Figure 12aii). The intensity of GaHx bands decreased faster in the presence of propane than under evacuation (Figure 12a,b), indicating that propane accelerated the decomposition of GaHx. This implies that at least a fraction of hydrogen and propane competes to adsorb on the same sites. The apparent activation energy of GaHx decomposition in the presence of propylene is comparable to the minimal apparent activation of PDH, suggesting that the desorption of adsorbed H could also be a kinetically relevant step in PDH (in addition to the initial CH bond activation step).

The interplay between gallium species, zeolite composition, and framework aluminum pairs in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influences the propane dehydrogenation activity and overall performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction, which are crucial for the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The gallium species formed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the formation of gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. The discrepancy between the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS indicates that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). The ratio of the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak to the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ is identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), showing a linear correlation between the density of framework Al pairs and the amount of GaHx. When Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite. Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between the densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species suggests that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species. Ga2O22+ is the most active propane dehydrogenation (PDH) species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Pulse titration results reveal three types of Ga species on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The turnover frequency normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) increases rapidly at low Ga loadings up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.05, then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, and declines as the Ga/Al ratio increases further. A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1002/advs.202207756\_3\].
