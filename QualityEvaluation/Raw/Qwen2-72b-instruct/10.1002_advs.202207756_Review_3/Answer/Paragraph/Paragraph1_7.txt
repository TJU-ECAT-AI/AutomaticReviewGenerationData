                    The interplay between gallium species, zeolite composition, and framework aluminum pairs in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influences the propane dehydrogenation activity and overall performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction, which are crucial for the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species formed on catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired BAS to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the formation of gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. The discrepancy between the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS indicates that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). The ratio of the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak to the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ is identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), showing a linear correlation between the density of framework Al pairs and the amount of GaHx. When Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite. Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between the densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species suggests that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species. Ga2O22+ is the most active propane dehydrogenation (PDH) species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Pulse titration results reveal three types of Ga species on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The turnover frequency normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) increases rapidly at low Ga loadings up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.05, then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, and declines as the Ga/Al ratio increases further. A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\].

                    Ga-修改的沸石催化剂中镓物种、沸石组成和框架铝对之间的相互作用对丙烷脱氢活性和整体性能有显著影响\[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]。在较低的Si/Al比率下，配对的Brnsted酸位点（BAS）更为普遍，这导致通过离子交换优先形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点在还原后能够形成镓氢化物（GaHx），这对丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性至关重要。相比之下，在较高的Si/Al比率下，BAS大多被隔离，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不会形成稳定的GaHx物种。形成GaHx物种的能力直接与配对BAS的存在相关，而配对BAS在较低的Si/Al比率下更为丰富。这些关系揭示了催化剂的结构，特别是BAS的分布和密度，在确定活性镓物种的性质和反应性方面起着关键作用\[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]。在较低Si/Al比率的催化剂上形成的镓物种更可能形成镓氢化物，而在较高Si/Al比率的催化剂上形成的镓物种则不太可能这样做。能够形成镓氢化物的镓物种是那些与配对BAS交换形成Ga+H+对位点的物种，而与孤立BAS交换形成的则是孤立的Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+物种在150 C下容易被水氧化形成GaOOH物种，而Ga+H+对位点在相同条件下则不活跃。这些发现表明，这两种类型的镓物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]。Ga-修改的沸石催化剂中的镓物种，包括镓氢化物，受到Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度的影响。代表镓氢化物的GaHx带取决于Si/Al比率和Ga/Al比率，表明镓物种化随沸石中Brnsted酸位点（BAS）的密度而变化。配对BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，导致形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立BAS的交换则形成孤立的Ga+物种。孤立的Ga+位点在550 C下无法形成稳定的GaHx物种，而Ga+H+对位点则能够形成GaHx物种。在高Si/Al比率的样品上，大多数BAS被隔离，导致形成孤立的Ga+物种。在550 C下用H2处理Ga+H+对后形成的镓物种在150 C下不会与水反应形成GaOOH，而只有孤立的Ga+物种被氧化。同位素标记实验验证了GaHx物种在150 C下不会与水反应。与孤立的Ga+位点不同，Ga+H+对位点在150 C下不能与水反应，进一步证实了这两种镓物种具有不同的性质。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性受到形成的镓物种的影响，这些镓物种依赖于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度\[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]。代表镓氢化物形成的GaHx带的强度最初随着Ga/H-ZSM-5（15，Y）上还原的Ga/Al比率的增加而增加，然后在Ga/Al比率为0.1时趋于平稳，然后随着Ga/Al比率超过0.56而下降。这一趋势在Ga/H-ZSM-5（28，Y）上相似，但最大强度较低。Ga交换消耗Brønsted酸位点（BAS）在两个样品中持续到Ga/Al比率超过0.7。GaHx和BAS消耗之间的差异表明，并非所有阳离子Ga物种在还原后都能形成Ga氢化物。这与Ga/H-ZSM-5（39，Y）上缺乏GaHx一致。Ga/H-ZSM-5（15，Y）和Ga/H-ZSM-5（28，Y）上GaHx峰的最大积分面积与对应于Co2+的UVvis带的比率在实验误差范围内相同，显示出框架Al对密度与GaHx量之间的线性相关性。当Ga被支持在（部分）Co2+交换的H-ZSM-5（15）上时，GaHx带的强度与沸石中交换的Co2+量成反比。由于只有框架Al对能够稳定二价阳离子物种，框架Al对密度与GaHx物种之间的相关性表明GaHx的前体可能是二价阳离子物种。Ga2O22+是Ga/H-ZSM-5上最活跃的丙烷脱氢（PDH）物种。脉冲滴定结果揭示了还原催化剂上的三种Ga物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚物。Ga/H-ZSM-5（15，Y）上归一化到沸石中Al量的周转频率（TOFAl）在低Ga负载下迅速增加，直到Ga/Al比率为0.05，然后随着Ga/Al比率上升到0.3而更缓慢地增长，然后随着Ga/Al比率的进一步增加而下降。在Si/Al比率为28的样品上观察到PDH速率对Ga/Al比率的类似三段依赖性。在Ga/H-ZSM-5（39，Y）上，TOFAl几乎线性增加到Ga/Al比率为0.55，然后在更高的Ga/Al比率下下降。Ga-修改的沸石催化剂中Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度之间的这些关系影响了活性镓物种，包括镓氢化物的形成和性质，并揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性\[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\]。
