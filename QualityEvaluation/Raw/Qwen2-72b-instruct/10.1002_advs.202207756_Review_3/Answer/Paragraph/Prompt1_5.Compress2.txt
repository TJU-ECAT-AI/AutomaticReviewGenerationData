{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation of gallium species, including gallium hydrides. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form stable gallium hydrides. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that cannot form stable gallium hydrides at high temperatures. These findings suggest that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, forming Ga+H+ pair sites, while isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, whereas Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions, indicating distinct catalytic properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are consumed by Ga exchange until the Ga/Al ratio surpasses 0.7. Not all cationic Ga species form Ga hydrides upon reduction, as evidenced by the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). The density of framework Al pairs correlates linearly with the amount of GaHx, suggesting a divalent cationic precursor. Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species. The PDH rate shows a three-segment dependence on the Ga/Al ratio, with a rapid increase up to 0.05, a slower rise to 0.3, and a decline thereafter.
