{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation of gallium species, including gallium hydrides. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more common, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites that can form stable gallium hydrides. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that are less stable and cannot form gallium hydrides at high temperatures. The Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under conditions that easily oxidize isolated Ga+ species to GaOOH. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may exhibit different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, with the Ga+H+ pair sites being more stable and potentially more active in propane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},

Brønsted acid site (BAS) consumption by Ga exchange persists until Ga/Al ratios exceed 0.7. Not all cationic Ga species form Ga hydrides upon reduction, as evidenced by the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y). The GaHx peak's integrated area correlates linearly with framework Al pair density, and the GaHx band intensity inversely correlates with Co2+ exchange. This suggests GaHx precursors are divalent cationic species. Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species. Three Ga species are present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers.
