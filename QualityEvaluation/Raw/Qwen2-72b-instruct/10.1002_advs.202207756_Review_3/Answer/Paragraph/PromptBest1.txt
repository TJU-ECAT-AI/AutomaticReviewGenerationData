The interplay between gallium species, zeolite composition, and framework aluminum pairs in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influences the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveals structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

The gallium species formed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are significantly influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

                    The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the formation of gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56 \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\]. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. The discrepancy between the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS indicates that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y) \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\]. The ratio of the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak to the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ is identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), showing a linear correlation between the density of framework Al pairs and the amount of GaHx. When Ga is supported on (partially) Co2+ exchanged H-ZSM-5 (15), the intensity of the GaHx band is inversely correlated with the amount of Co2+ exchanged in the zeolite. Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between the densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species suggests that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\]. Ga2O22+ is the most active propane dehydrogenation (PDH) species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Pulse titration results reveal three types of Ga species on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The turnover frequency normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) increases rapidly at low Ga loadings up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.05, then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, and declines as the Ga/Al ratio increases further. A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\]. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\].

The study of the three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio could also shed light on the optimal Ga loading for maximum catalytic activity. These directions could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and selective propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between the densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species suggests that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species. Ga2O22+ is the most active propane dehydrogenation (PDH) species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Pulse titration results reveal three types of Ga species on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The turnover frequency normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) increases rapidly at low Ga loadings up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.05, then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, and declines as the Ga/Al ratio increases further. A similar three-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio is observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), TOFAl increases almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55 before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios. These relationships between the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and reveal structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1002/advs.202207756_3\].

The gallium species formed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are significantly influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites through ion-exchange. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming gallium hydrides (GaHx) upon reduction. In contrast, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The ability to form GaHx species is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and the density of framework aluminum pairs. The gallium species formed on the catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those on the catalysts with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species that can form gallium hydrides are those that exchange with paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while those that exchange with isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. The isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. The gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. The GaHx bands, which represent gallium hydrides, depend on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the gallium speciation varies with the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS forms isolated Ga+ species. Isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C, while Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\]. On a sample with a high Si/Al ratio, the majority of the BAS are isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species. The gallium species formed after treating Ga+H+ pair with H2 at 550 C do not react with water to form GaOOH at 150 C, while only isolated Ga+ species are oxidized. Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not react with water at 150 C. Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two gallium species possess distinct properties. These relationships reveal that the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are influenced by the gallium species formed, which are dependent on the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density \[10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004\].

The intensity of the GaHx band, which represents the formation of gallium hydrides, initially increases with the Ga/Al ratio on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) before leveling off at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 and then declines as the Ga/Al ratio rises above 0.56. This trend is similar on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum intensity. The consumption of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) by Ga exchange continues until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 in both samples. The discrepancy between the formation of GaHx and the consumption of BAS indicates that not all cationic Ga species can form Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is consistent with the lack of GaHx on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y).
