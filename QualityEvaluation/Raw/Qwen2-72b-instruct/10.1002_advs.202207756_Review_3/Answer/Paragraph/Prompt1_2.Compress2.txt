{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites that can form stable gallium hydrides. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable gallium hydrides at high temperatures. The ability to form gallium hydrides is directly related to the presence of paired BAS, which are more abundant at lower Si/Al ratios. These relationships reveal that the structure of the catalyst, particularly the distribution and density of BAS, plays a critical role in determining the nature and reactivity of the active gallium species. The presence of Ga+H+ pair sites versus isolated Ga+ species could have significant implications for the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as they may exhibit different catalytic properties. Isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions, indicating distinct properties that could affect catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
