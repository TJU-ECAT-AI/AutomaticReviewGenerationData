The activity and performance of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation are intricately influenced by the interplay between gallium species, zeolite composition, and framework aluminum pairs. Gallium, when incorporated into the zeolite framework, can exist in various oxidation states and coordination environments, which significantly affect the catalytic properties. The zeolite composition, particularly the Si/Al ratio, plays a crucial role in determining the acidity and stability of the catalyst. Moreover, the proximity and arrangement of framework aluminum pairs can alter the electronic environment around the gallium centers, impacting their reactivity towards propane. This complex interplay between the gallium species, zeolite framework, and aluminum pairs is critical in tuning the selectivity and activity of the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, making it a key area of research for enhancing catalytic performance in the petrochemical industry.
