{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation of gallium species, including gallium hydrides. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites that can form stable GaHx species. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable GaHx species at high temperatures. The Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under conditions that easily oxidize isolated Ga+ species to GaOOH at 150 C. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, with the Ga+H+ pair sites being more conducive to forming gallium hydrides and potentially more active in propane dehydrogenation.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
