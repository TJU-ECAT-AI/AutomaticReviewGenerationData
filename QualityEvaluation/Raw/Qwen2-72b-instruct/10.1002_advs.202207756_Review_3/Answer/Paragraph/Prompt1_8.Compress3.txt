{"DOC": "In Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, gallium species, including gallium hydrides, are influenced by the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density. At lower Si/Al ratios, paired Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are more prevalent, leading to the preferential formation of Ga+H+ pair sites that can form gallium hydrides upon reduction. Conversely, at higher Si/Al ratios, BAS are mostly isolated, resulting in isolated Ga+ species that do not form stable gallium hydrides at high temperatures. The gallium species formed on catalysts with lower Si/Al ratios are more likely to form gallium hydrides, while those with higher Si/Al ratios are less likely to do so. Isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH, whereas Ga+H+ pair sites are inactive under the same conditions. These findings suggest that the two types of gallium species may have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, with the Ga+H+ pair sites being more stable and less reactive with water. The gallium species' formation and properties are directly related to the density and distribution of BAS, highlighting the critical role of zeolite composition in determining the nature and reactivity of active gallium species.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2020.11.004"},
