A &
M University, College Station, TX77843, USA Dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene occurs over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 cat- alyst at 700 under non-oxidizing conditions. Following an initial induction period,during which CH4 reactant reduces the original Mo 6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C and deposition of coke occurs, a benzene selectivity of,,, 70% at a CH4 conversion of 8-10% could be sustained for more than 16 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray pow- der diffraction measurements indicate that the reduced Mo is highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. Initial activation of CH4 reactant occurs on M02C sites, leading to the formation of C2H4 as the primary product. The latter then undergoes subsequent oligomerization reactions on acidic sites of the zeolite to form aromatic products.

1. Introduction
Several recent studies have demonstrated that methane can be selectively con- verted into benzene and other aromatic products over various metal oxides and metal-containing zeolite catalysts [ 1-6]. Considerable economic incentives exist for further developing such improved methane utilization processes. The present inves- tigation was performed to obtain additional information about the dehydroaroma- tization of methane over a Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst. Particular emphasis was placed on determining the nature of the catalytic sites responsible for initial CH4 activation and on indentifying the reaction intermediate(s).

The material was subsequently dried for 4 h at 120 and then calcined in air for 4 h at 500 Both catalysts were used in the form of 20--45 mesh granules.
2.2. REACTION SYSTEM
All reactions were carried out in a flow reactor system consisting of a 6.4 mm i.d. alumina tube (Coors AD-998, 99.8% A1203) containing 1.0 g of catalyst. In order to minimize contributions from homogeneous gas-phase reactions, the void spaces above and below the catalyst bed were filled with quartz chips. Reaction temperature was measured and controlled using a thermocouple in an alumina thermowell attached to the outside of the reactor at the midpoint of the catalyst bed.
Reactant, diluent, and pretreatment gases, viz., 1% N2/CH4, O2, He, and H2,all of ultra-high purity, and CO2 (99.5%), were obtained from Matheson and were used without further purification. Gas flows were regulated by mass flow control- lers. Prior to beginning a reaction, the reactor temperature was increased to 700 under a flow of He; the catalyst was then treated at the latter temperature under a flow of 02 for 30 min, and finally flushed with He at the same temperature for 1 h.
The reactant gas, consisting of CH4 containing 1 vol% N2 as an internal standard to allow correction for coke formation, was then introduced. Reaction mixtures were analyzed periodically by gas chromatography, using a HayeSep D column. All reactions were performed at 700 and at a total pressure of 1 atm.
2.3. CATALYST CHARACTERIZATION
XPS and ISS spectra, which were used to determine the abundance and chemical states of surface components in the catalysts, were acquired using a PHI model 5500 spectrometer. All spectra were obtained using catalyst samples in the form of pressed wafers that had been pretreated in either of two ways: (i) "fresh" samples were prepared by treating the previously calcined samples in a separate external quartz reactor in a stream of 02 at 700 for 30 min, and (ii) "used" samples were prepared by treating the fresh catalysts in CH4, CO, CO2, or H2 at 700 in order to duplicate the conditions employed in the catalytic reaction experiments. The external quartz reactor system used for these XPS/ISS pretreatments allowed in situ transfer of the ceramic holder containing the treated sample into an O-ring- sealed stainless steel transport vessel. The removable vessel was then transferred to the inlet system of the spectrometer, where it was evacuated and the sample subse- quently introduced into the UHV analysis chamber of the instrument without exposure to the atmosphere. Typical XPS data acquisitions utilized a pass energy of

29.35 eV, a step increment of0.125 eV, and a Mg anode power of
400 W. All binding energies were referenced to the Al 2p line of the ZSM-5 zeolite at 74.5 eV.

REACTION RESULTS
Although the formation of aromatic products from CH4 in the absence of 02 is not thermodynamically favorable at low temperatures (< 500 the equilibrium CH4 conversion at 700 is -. 12%, with approximately equimolar amounts of ben- zene and naphthalene being the thermodynamically preferred products. The solid data points in fig. 1 show typical results obtained for the reaction of CH4 over the 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 and a space velocity of 800 h -1. Following an initial activation period during the first 1 to 2 h of reaction, a C6H6 selectivity of ,, 70% could be sustained at a CH4 conversion that began at the thermodynamic equilibrium value of ,- 12% and only slowly declined with increasing time on stream. After 16 h of operation, the CH4 conversion was still N 8%. An identically pretreated sample of pure ZSM-5, containing no Mo, exhibited no detectable activ- ity for CH4 conversion under these conditions. The original catalytic behavior of

D. Wang et al. / Catalytic conversion of

The selectivity to naphthalene attained a value of ,- 20% immediately fol- lowing the initial activation period, but then declined rapidly with increasing time on stream. Presumably, the gradual accumulation of coke in the zeolite channels decreased their effective diameter, thus increasingly inhibiting the formation (or escape) of the thermodynamically favored, but too large, naphthalene molecules.Thus, after a sufficiently long reaction time, benzene and a small amount of toluene were selectively produced as the kinetically favored aromatic products. The selec- tivity to C2-C3 hydrocarbons, although always small compared to that of benzene,increased continuously with increasing reaction time, as coke deposition gradually deactivated the acidic sites in the zeolite where the ethylene primary product (vide infra) undergoes secondary reactions.It is significant that during the first 20 min of the initial 1-2 h activation period,virtually no hydrocarbons were formed, and the principal products observed were 25 20 15 >

Thus, the high (> 20%) methane conversion observed during the first few minutes of reaction (fig. 1) is due to reduction of the original MoO3 in the zeolite channels by the CH4 reactant, sug- gesting that the catalytic sites leading to hydrocarbon product formation require a reduced form of molybdenum. As shown by the open data points in fig. 1, however,pre-reduction of the catalyst in CO at 700 resulted in virtually identical catalytic behavior, including the occurrence of the initial activation period, to that observed without CO pretreatment. Reduction of Mo following the CO treatment was con- firmed by XPS measurements and was consistent with the fact that in this case sig- nificant amounts of CO and H20 products were not observed during the early stages of reaction. Pre-reduction of the calcined catalyst in H2 at 700 resulted in a similar, although slightly inferior, catalytic performance to that observed follow- ing CO pretreatment. It may be concluded, therefore, that reduction of Mo,although necessary, is not solely responsible for the observed induction period.
Additional modification of the Mo-containing sites, perhaps involving partial deactivation by coke deposition, is evidently required to selectively activate CH4 and leads to hydrocarbon product formation.
3.2. CHARACTERIZATION
OF ACTIVE SITES
The chemical state of Mo in the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS spectra obtained in the Mo 3d region following various treatments designed to simulate those in the catalytic reaction experiments are presented in fig. 3. Spectrum a indicates that, following 02 treatment at 700 molybdenum within the zeolite exists principally in the form of Mo 6+, presumably as MoO3 [7]. A small amount of Mo 5+, which can be formed via photoreduction by the X-ray source, may also exist within the Mo 3d envelope. Exposure of the cat- alyst to CH4 for increasing lengths of time at 700 caused gradual reduction of the Mo 6+, through various unresolved intermediate oxidation states, eventually lead- ing to complete transformation into the carbide Mo2C [8,9]. (Metallic Mo o and Mo2C cannot be readily distinguished in XPS spectra because of the similarity in Mo 3d binding energies of these two species and because of the close resemblance of the C 1 s binding energy in Mo2C to that ofgraphitic surface carbon. In the presence of a carbon source, such as CH4, however, it is the carbide, not metallic Mo that is the thermodynamically stable form of Mo at 700 [10,11]). Disappearance of the original Mo 6+ was virtually complete after exposure of the calcined catalyst to CH4 for 2 h, which corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period that is observed during the catalytic reaction (fig. 1). The decrease in overall Mo 3d signal intensity during CH4 exposure may be ascribed to deposition of carbonaceous sur- face material. XRD patterns of the catalyst contained no peaks due to the thermo- dynamically stable Mo2C, indicating that the carbide is highly dispersed within the zeolite channels.

(a) After calcination in 02 at 700*; (b, c, d, e) after exposure to CH4 at 700"C for 10 rain, 30 rain, 2 h, and 10 h, respectively; (f) after subsequent exposure of(e) to CO2 at 700 Xu and co-workers [2,3] proposed that MoO3 is involved in the active sites, causing dimerization of a CH2=MoO3 intermediate species to produce ethylene. Solymosi et al. [5], based on kinetic and XPS measurements of a Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, sug- gested that a partially reduced molybdenum species, probably Mo 4+, was responsi- ble for methane activation and for formation of benzene product. Because of this uncertainty about the active form of Mo, we performed additional spectroscopic and kinetic experiments to further elucidate the chemical nature of the Mo species involved in CH4 activation. After treatment ofa Mo/ZSM-5 sample in CH4 for 2 h at 700 it was exposed to 80 Torr of CO2 for 30 rain at the same temperature. It is evident from the resulting XPS spectrum (fig. 3t") that exposure to CO2 caused extensive re-oxidation of Mo, resulting in complete removal of the Mo2C species and formation of at least two higher oxidation states, having Mo 3d5/2 binding energies at 229.5 and 233 eV, the latter corresponding to M o 6+.
In an accompanying catalytic experiment, when a partial pressure of 80 Torr of CO2 was temporarily added to the CH4 feed over the 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700 after having attained steady-state conditions, an immediate cessation of benzene production (and of all CH4 conversion) occurred, as shown in fig. 4.

Removal of CO2 from the feed caused a re-occurrence of the initial activation per- iod and almost complete re-establishment of the catalytic behavior prior to CO2 introduction. Addition of
2.5 Torr of
H20 vapor to the CH4 feed had a qualitatively similar effect to that of CO2. These results indicate that the sites responsible for CH4 activation over Mo/ZSM-5 do not contain oxidized forms of molybdenum,such as Mo 4+ or Mo 6+, and require the presence of the Mo2C species.
In order to investigate the catalytic behavior of unsupported molybdenum car- bide for methane conversion, bulk Mo2C was prepared by treatment of MoO3 in a flowing 4 : 1 mixture of H2/CH4 at 700 [10]. (The presence of pure Mo2C follow- ing this procedure was confirmed by XRD measurements.) The synthesized bulk carbide exhibited a low, but measurable, activity for CH4 conversion at 700- 800 as shown in table 1. However, only C2 products, principally ethylene, were produced over this material; no detectable aromatic products were observed. When the carbide was dispersed in a high surface area (,, 250 m2/g) non-acidic SiO2 gel,by impregnating the support with ammonium paramolybdate and again treating with H2/CH4 at 700 substantially higher CH4 conversions could be attained than those observed for bulk Mo2C. However, large amounts of coke were formed,and the selectivity to benzene was still markedly inferior to that obtained with the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, indicating that both Mo2C and acidic sites in the zeolite are required to produce aromatic products. Moreover, the carbidic and acidic sites 296

Thus, it appears that CH4 is initially activated on sites involving Mo2C within the zeolite channels to produce an intermediate that reacts further on acidic sites to form the final aromatic products.
3.3. NATURE OF THE REACTION INTERMEDIATE
Ethylene appears to be the most likely initial product of CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, since its selectivity increases continuously with increasing reaction space velocity, while those of all other products simultaneously decrease.
Furthermore, conversion of C2H4 reactant over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 results in a hydrocarbon product distribution (excluding the CH4 that is formed) and overall catalytic behavior that is very similar to that observed with cn 4 reactant, including the occurrence of the initial activation period, during which Mo 6+ becomes reduced to Mo2C and the latter is partially deactivated by coke deposition. Similarly, when 25 Torr of C2H4 were introduced to the CH4 feed over Mo/ZSM-5 at 700 after the catalyst had attained a steady-state condition, the amount of benzene product abruptly increased. Just as significantly,however, conversion of C2H4 as a reactant at 700 over pure H-ZSM-5, containing no Mo, gives a hydrocarbon product dis- tribution that closely resembles those obtained with either CH4 or C2H4 reactant over Mo/ZSM-5 and, moreover, involves no initial activation period. (It should be noted that, despite similarities in product distributions, initial conversions of C2H4 reactant are larger than with CH4 reactant, but deactivation occurs much more

methane to benzene over Mo/ ZSM-5 297 rapidly due to increased coke deposition with the olefin reactant.) These results demonstrate that not only is ethylene the primary product from CH4 conversion over Mo/ZSM-5, but that its secondary reactions leading to aromatic and other higher hydrocarbon products occur entirely on acidic sites that do not require the presence of molybdenum.
Thus, the overall reaction sequence occurring during dehydroaromatization of methane over Mo/ZSM-5 involves initial reduction by CH4 of Mo 6+ (presumably as MOO3) in the calcined catalyst to Mo2C. Activation of CH4 reactant then occurs on these Mo-contaiuing, probably carbidic, sites within the zeolite channels to pro- duce ethylene (and H2) as the sole primary product. Ethylene then undergoes subse- quent oligomerization reactions on neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite,eventually forming the observed aromatic products. Although naphthalene is observed in the early stages of reaction, the accumulation of coke causes gradual restriction of the zeolite channels with increasing time on stream and eventual dis- appearance of higher aromatic products.
