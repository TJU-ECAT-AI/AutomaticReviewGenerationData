A new tantalumhydride supported on zirconium hydroxide [(SiO)2Zr(H)OTa(H)x(OSi)] (x = 1 or 3) was prepared using surface organometallic chemistry and its catalytic properties in the propane metathesis reaction were assessed showing improved activity and selectivities in comparison to the tantalum-hydride supported on silica.
Introduction The need for a more efficient use of raw materials, such as petroleum, has lead to an increase in research effort in the petrochemical industry, but to date the transformation of alkanes at low temperatures is still a challenge.1 One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis.
This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. While discovered in the seventies,2 it has been shown only recently that efficient catalysts could carry out this reaction at relatively low temperatures, e.g. 150 C,3 and even catalyse the cross-metathesis of methane and aromatics with linear alkanes.4,5 The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1),6 and more recently it was shown that alumina supported tungsten hydrides are in fact more efficient and more selective.7 Now there are even systems which use a mixture of homogeneous catalysts able to perform dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin followed by olefin metathesis.8 In the case of single component well-defined systems such as 1,structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordina- tion electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances.9 In view of optimising the catalytic performances,one possible approach is to change the coordination sphere of tantalum by grafting the tantalum on a metal hydroxide obtained through epitaxy with the hope that similar low coordination would occur. We have previously shown that it was possible to generate high surface area material (190 m2 g1) having a high concentration of surface zirconium hydroxides by reacting the silica-supported zirconium hydride [ZrH] with N2O (Scheme 1).10 Starting from a mixture of a mono-hydride [(SiO)3Zr(H)] (2a,70%) and di-hydride surface species [(SiO)2Zr(H)2] (2b, 30%),the corresponding silica-supported zirconium mono- and di- hydroxide surface species were obtained: [(SiO)3Zr(OH)] (3a,70%) and [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b, 30%); this mixture is referred to as Laboratoire de Chimie Organom etallique de Surface, CPE Lyon 43 Bd du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69616, Villeurbanne Cedex, France.

Experimental General All experiments were carried out under a controlled atmosphere,using Schlenk and glove-box techniques. For the synthesis and treatments of the surface species, reactions were carried out using high-vacuum lines (1.34 × 103 kPa) and glove-box techniques. [ZrOH]10 and [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4)11 were prepared following literature procedures. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 550 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a cell designed for in situ reactions under a controlled atmosphere. Elemental analyses were performed at the Service Central dAnalyses du CNRS in Solaize.
Solid state NMR data acquisition and analysis 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Bruker spectrometer (4 mm CP-MAS). Chemical shifts (d) are given in ppm with respect to Me4Si.

Samples were placed in an air-protected cell equipped with Kapton windows. A double crystal Si(111) monochromator was used, and the flux before and after entering the cell was measured by ionization chambers. The final adsorption spectra were obtained by averaging three successive acquisitions recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode at the tantalum LIII edge, from 9700 to 11 000 eV with a 2 eV step. EXAFS analysis was performed using software written by Michalowicz.12 The background absorption was calculated by using a theoretical expression developed by Lengler and Eisenberger, and the single atomic absorption of the absorber was interpolated by a fifth or sixth-degree polynomial between ca. 11 600 and 12 400 eV . To remove low frequency contributions from the spectrum, each spectrum was carefully extracted by varying both the degree and first point of the polynomial. The program FEFF-813 was used to calculate theoretical values of amplitudes and phases. Fits were optimized by considering both k1 and k3 weightings of the EXAFS, since the latter emphasizes the higher shells, whereas the former favours near shells of light scatterers. No significant differences were observed for refinements carried out using the two weightings. Selective Fourier filtering of the EXAFS was used to aid in the identification of the backscatterers, giving rise to the peaks occurring between 2.5 and 4 A .
Grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) on [ZrOH] (3) by sublimation monitored by IR spectroscopy. Synthesis of {4/[ZrOH]} (5) This material was prepared by the sublimation (80 C, 1.3 × 103 Pa) of an excess of 4 on a self-supporting disk of 3 followed by a reverse sublimation to remove the excess of 4. During this process, the pellet turned from white to orange. An IR spectrum was recorded at each step. Infrared (mmax/cm1): 30002800 (CH,vs), 2260 and 2200 (SiH, m), 1500 and 1300 (CH, s).
Grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) on [ZrOH] (3) by impregnation. Synthesis of {4/[ZrOH]} (5) In a Schlenk tube, [ZrOH] (3) (480 mg) was contacted with a solution of 4 (90 mg, 0.2 mmol) in pentane at 25 C. After 2 h, the supernatant was filtered and the solid washed twice with pentane and then dried under high vacuum (1.3 × 103 Pa). The gas phase analysis after impregnation showed that 1.1 equiv. of CH3-tBu per Ta evolved. Elemental analysis (%wt): Zr, 2.8; Ta, 3.7; C, 3.25. 1H MAS solid state NMR: d 4.4 (s, SiH, =CH), 0.8 (s, CH2, CH3). 13C CP-MAS solid state NMR: d 243 (=CH), 95 (CH2), 30 (CH3).
Synthesis of the tantalum hydride supported on [ZrOH]:[TaH/ZrOH] (6) Whether prepared by sublimation or impregnation, 30 mg of 5 was treated with a large excess of H2 in a 350 mL glass reactor (73 kPa), and the reaction mixture heated at 150 C for 12 h.
The material turned brown. The gas phase analysis showed the presence of methane (65%) and ethane (35%). Elemental analysis (%wt): Zr, 2.8; Ta, 3.7. 1H solid-state MAS NMR: d 10.1 (ZrH), 4.4 (s, SiH, =CH), 0.8 (s, SiR). Infrared (mmax/cm1): 22602200 m (SiH), 1800 (TaH, w), 1630 (ZrH, w).
Synthesis of the tantalum hydride supported on mixed oxide support nSiO2ZrO2 4SiO2ZrO2 was prepared from the thermal decomposition of [Zr(OSi(OtBu)3)4],14 while 2SiO2ZrO2 and 10SiO2ZrO2 were prepared by a non-hydrolytic solgel process.15 Before use, these materials were calcinated at 500 C and subsequently treated at 500 C under high vacuum for 12 h. The corresponding hydrides were then prepared in 2 steps: grafting of 4 followed by treatment under H2 using the same procedures as described above for the synthesis of 5 and 6.
Metathesis of propane. Representative procedure Propane (970 equiv. per Ta) was introduced in an infrared cell containing a pellet of the supported tantalum hydride. Then the cell was introduced in a furnace preheated at 150 C. Small amounts of the gas phase were collected during the reaction (without cooling the reaction mixture) over 5 d and analyzed by
GC. TON is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of propane
having reacted by the number of moles of tantalum. The selectivity of a product (i) is defined as the mol amount of this product (i) divided by the mol amount of all products.
Results and discussions Reaction of [ZrOH] with 4 When [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) was sublimed onto a self- supporting disk of [ZrOH] (3), the solid turned from white to orange. Monitoring the reaction by infrared spectroscopy shows that most of the m(ZrOH) bands have disappeared with the concomitant appearance of intense m(CH) and d(CH2) bands,indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups have reacted with 4 to form (ZrOTa) bonds. Note that the (SiH) groups coming from the synthesis of 2a and 2b, do not react during the grafting process (Fig. 1, spectra a and b). Elemental analysis on the resulting solid {4/[ZrOH]} (5) shows a 3.25%wt, 3.70%wt and
2.80%wt of C, Ta and Zr, respectively, and analysis of the gas
phase during grafting indicates the formation of 1.1 equiv. of 2,2- dimethylpropane (CH3tBu). First, the Ta/Zr molar ratio is 0.7,confirming that most zirconium hydroxide groups have reacted with Ta. Second, the formation of a surface complex containing 15C/Ta and the release of 1.1 CH3tBu/Ta (5.5 C) upon grafting are in agreement with the presence of three neopentyl-like ligands attached to the supported tantalum.
Furthermore, the 1H solid-state NMR spectrum shows the presence of a peak at 0.8 ppm, attributed to CH2 of the neopentyl and the CH3 protons of both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands, along with a peak at 4.4 ppm, which can be attributed to both a carbenic proton (=CH) and silane (SiH) groups10 still present at the surface (Fig. 2a). The 13C solid-state CP/MAS NMR spectrum of the corresponding 13C labeled compound a to the metal center presents three peaks at 30, 80 (shoulder), 95 924  Dalton Trans., 2007, 923927 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007 Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM on 26 December 2012 Published on 18 January 2007 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B616921J View Article Online Fig. 1 Infrared spectra of: (a) [ZrOH], (b) {4/[ZrOH]}, (c) {TaH/[Zr OH]} (6), (d) Subtraction of (a) to (c). and 243 ppm (Fig. 2b). The signals at 30, 95 and 243 ppm, are very similar to those observed for [(SiO)Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] supported on SiO2-(700),9,16 showing that the major species of {4/[ZrOH]} (is probably [(ZrO)Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (5a) and results from the grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] on [(SiO)3ZrOH] (3a) (Scheme 2). Moreover, the minor species (ca. 5%), observed at 80 ppm slightly up-field to 5a,17 can probably arise from [(SiO)2Zr(OH){OTa(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2}] (5b), as a result from the reaction of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] with [(SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b), the corresponding bis(zirconoxy) species 5c being very unlikely because of the strain involved in its formation.Fig. 2 Solid-state NMR spectra of {4/[ZrOH]}: (a) 1H MAS, NS = 32, LB = 0.00 Hz, D1 = 1 s; (b) 13C CP-MAS, NS = 3789, LB = 80.0 Hz, D1 = 2 s.Supported tantalumhydride species When 5 is heated at 150 C under H2, the infrared spectrum shows a strong diminution of the m(CH) and d(CH2) bands of the perhydrocarbyl ligands previously bound to tantalum. We note the appearance of two bands of weak intensity at 1630 and 1800 cm1 attributed to m(ZrH)10,18 and m(TaH),6 respectively (Fig. 1, spectra b, c and d). Note that the m(SiH) bands have not been significantly modified in frequency and intensity indicating that no siloxane bridge (SiOSi) has reacted during the formation of the new species, in contrast to what is observed Scheme 2 Reaction of 4 on [ZrOH], {4/[ZrOH]}.This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007 Dalton Trans., 2007, 923927  925 Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM on 26 December 2012 Published on 18 January 2007 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B616921J View Article Online during the preparation of the tantalum or the zirconium hydrides supported on silica. During this process, methane (65%mol) and ethane (35%mol) are formed (14.5 C/Ta), and this comes from the hydrogenolysis of the neopentyl-like ligands and the cor- responding 2,2-dimethylpropane (2.9 equiv/Ta, expected 3 for structure 5a). The 1H solid-state NMR spectrum of the resulting solid, [TaH/ZrOH] (6), displays three peaks at 10.1, 4.4 and
0.8 ppm (Fig. S1), which can be readily attributed to (ZrH),
(SiH) and (SiR) species, respectively, by comparison with the silica supported zirconium hydride.10 Note that the hydride bound to Ta is not observed, as in the case of the silica supported tantalum hydride; this resonance has only been observed as a weak signal when tantalum hydride is prepared on MCM-41 material.19 While the formation of a tantalum hydride (TaH) was expected (hydrogenolysis of the perhydrocarbyl ligands bound to tantalum as already observed for 1), the formation of zirconium hydride (Zr H) indicates that ZrO bonds were cleaved during the treatment under H2. Note that treatment of well-defined silica supported perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2 gives hydrides along with (SiH), which has been explained by the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent siloxane bridges.6,2022 Similarly, one can propose that the putative tantalum tetrahydride intermediate can react with adjacent (Zr OSi) to form (TaOSi) and (ZrH) bonds (Scheme 3).

Further understanding of the coordination sphere of this sur- face species was investigated through extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) at the Ta LIII edge. The data are in agreement with a first shell containing 2 oxygen atoms at
1.88 A
, i.e. 2 O covalently bonded to Ta, along with a third oxygen atom at 2.97 A , suggesting a weak interaction between tantalum and a siloxane-like bridge of the surface. Concerning the second coordination shell, the correlation between the experimental and simulated spectra is clearly improved (see R axes between 3 A and
4 A
in Fig. 3), when a zirconium and a silicon atom are in the second coordination sphere of tantalum (Fig. 3a and Table 1),giving a ZrOTaOSi model (6a), instead of two silicon atoms (Fig. 3b and Table 1), having a (SiO)2Ta model. The fit considering the model 6a, with four shells around the central Ta atom, is also Table 1 EXAFS structural parameters derived from the model 6a or (ZrO)Ta(OSi), the errors generated in RoundMidnight are indicated in parenthesesa TaX Coord.

Fig. 3 Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectrum obtained for [TaH/ZrOH] with two different simulations: (a) ZrOTaOSi 6a, (b) SiOTaOSi (for the k3v(k) spectra, see Fig. S2). more satisfactory than other fits considering only three shells since it presents a lower quality factor.
In conclusion, both IR and EXAFS data are consistent with the formation of 6a [(SiO)2Zr(H)OTa(H)x(OSi)] (x = 1 or 3) as the major species after treatment of {4/[ZrOH]} with H2.
Propane metathesis The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of [(SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane. Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 926  Dalton Trans., 2007, 923927 This journal is  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2007 Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM on 26 December 2012 Published on 18 January 2007 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B616921J View Article Online 8 h for 1. Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while ZrH itself is inactive in alkane metathesis. Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively. The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1:23,24 in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively). The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hy- drides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides:slower deactivation, higher TON, lower methane selectivity and higher Cn+1/Cn1 homologue selectivity.7 Fig. 4 Comparison of [(SiO)2TaH] and [TaH/ZrOH] in the metathesis of propane: (a) activity, (b) selectivity.
In order to understand the role of zirconium, we have also investigated the preparation of tantalum hydrides on mixed oxide supports SiO2ZrO2 with various SiO2ZrO2 ratios: 2SiO2 ZrO2, 4SiO2ZrO2 and 10SiO2ZrO2. Note that these mixed oxide systems do not contain ZrOH surface species, but only silanols. Therefore, the grafting of 4 onto these materials occured via the reaction of the silanols, and after treatment under H2,the corresponding tantalum hydride complexes were prepared:[TaH/{2SiO2ZrO2}] (7), [TaH/{4SiO2ZrO2}] (8) and [Ta H/{10SiO2ZrO2}] (9) (%wt Ta: 10, 9 and 14.7 respectively). In the case of 8, this reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy (see Fig. S3), and only TaH and SiH bands were observed in contrast to 6 (where ZrH bonds were formed) which is consistent with the formation of a [(SiO2)TaH] species.
In fact, in all cases (79), the TON obtained after 120 h in the metathesis of propane are close to that obtained for 1 (60): 56, 64 and 63 for 7, 8 and 9, respectively (see Fig. S4). Therefore, the presence of zirconium in the support is not the sole cause for higher activity. The requirement of a tetrahedral Zr imposed by the silica support is likely to be a very important parameter. The support [ZrOH] may favor a low coordination for tantalum hydride, not possible on other supports such as the mixed oxides.
