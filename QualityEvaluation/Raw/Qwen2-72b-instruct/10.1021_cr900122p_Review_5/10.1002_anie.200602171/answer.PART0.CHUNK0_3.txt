[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride3 prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."
[4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
[5] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
[6] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
[7] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
[8] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."
[9] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

1.The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This process is based on π-bond metathesis, which is the key step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation, with alkylidene hydrides playing a critical role as intermediates. The selectivity of the products is determined by the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, with substituents in the [1,3]-positions generating less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction. The mechanism can be based on a single-site mechanism, where one site generates the olefin and another carries out the metathesis, or it can involve two sites for the generation of the olefin and the metathesis step. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been detrimental to catalyst performance in the past, but the current study shows that an imido ligand can be used successfully.

1.由硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化下的烷基化反应机制涉及将特定的烷基转化为其较低和较高的同系物。此过程基于π-键化反应，这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤，其中烷基化氢化物作为关键中间体发挥着重要作用。产物的选择性是基于在金属环丁烷中间体中最小化立体相互作用的模型确定的，其中取代基在[1,3]-位置产生的立体障碍小于在[1,2]-位置。较低的烷基同系物是通过在碳烯中间体上通过CH活化进行配体交换和α-H抽提过程形成的。该机制可以基于单点机制，其中一个点生成烯烃，另一个点进行化反应，或者可以涉及两个点用于生成烯烃和化反应步骤。引入辅助配体，可以控制催化剂的反应性和选择性，过去对催化剂性能有害，但目前的研究表明，可以成功使用亚氨基配体。
