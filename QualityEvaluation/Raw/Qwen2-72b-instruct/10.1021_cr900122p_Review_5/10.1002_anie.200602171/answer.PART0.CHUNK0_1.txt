[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
[4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
[5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
[6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

1.The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This process is based on π-bond metathesis, which is the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, acting as the key carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this reaction. The selectivity of initiation products can be understood based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site mechanism, where one site generates the olefin and another carries out the metathesis, or it can involve two sites. However, the introduction of ancillary ligands that could control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts has been detrimental to catalyst performances in the past.

1.由硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃互换反应机制涉及将特定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。此过程基于π-键互换，即烯烃和卡宾的相互作用，作为关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成过程。烷基亚甲基氢化物是此反应中的关键中间体。根据为烯烃互换开发的模型，可以理解引发产物的选择性，该模型基于在金属环丁烷中间体中最小化立体相互作用。该机制可以基于单站点机制，其中一个站点生成烯烃，另一个站点执行互换，或者它可以涉及两个站点。然而，过去引入的辅助配体（可以控制催化剂的反应性和选择性）对催化剂性能有害。
