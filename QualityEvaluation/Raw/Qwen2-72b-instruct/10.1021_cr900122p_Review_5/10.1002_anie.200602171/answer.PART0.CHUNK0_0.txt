[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
[2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
[4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
[5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
[6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

1.The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This process is facilitated by the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, known as π-bond metathesis, which is the key step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. Alkylidene hydrides play a critical role as intermediates in this reaction. The introduction of ancillary ligands to control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts has been a goal, but so far, such ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The selectivity of initiation products can be understood based on a model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can involve a single site or two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis.

1.由硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的机制涉及将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。这一过程通过烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用，即π-键化，这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。烷基化氢化物作为这一反应中的关键中间体。引入辅助配体以控制催化剂的反应性和选择性一直是目标，但到目前为止，这些配体对催化剂性能有害。根据为烯烃化反应开发的模型，可以理解起始产物的选择性，该模型通过最小化金属环丁烷中间体中的立体相互作用来工作。该机制可能涉及一个单一的位点，也可能涉及两个位点，一个用于生成烯烃，另一个用于化反应。
