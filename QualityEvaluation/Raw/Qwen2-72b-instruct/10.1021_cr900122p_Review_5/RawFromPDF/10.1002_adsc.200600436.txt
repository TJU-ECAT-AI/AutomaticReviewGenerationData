Abstract: Grafting of [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3] (1)
on silica-alumina partially dehydroxylated at 5008C
generates a surface complex [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)-
ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3] (2) as evidenced by mass balance analy-
sis, IR, and NMR spectroscopy. Upon treatment of
this species under H2, a tungsten hydride derivative,
[(SiO)(EO)W(H)x] (3), (E=Si or Al), is formed.
Both of these complexes are active as alkane meta-
thesis catalysts. The activity of this hydride is similar
to that observed for the tungsten hydride-supported
on alumina and much greater than that obtained on
silica. Noteworthy are the selectivities in higher
alkane homologues, that is Cn+1>Cn+2, which are
fully consistent with olefin metathesis being the key
homologation process.

mina; tungsten
Introduction
Conversion of alkanes is still of major interest in the
petrochemical industry, and the current oil prices and
the expected future situation in terms of supply and
demand make the efficient use and transformation of
this natural resource of major importance.[1,2] Since
the early 1990s, we have developed a series of oxide-
supported metal hydrides[3–6] for the low temperature
alkane transformation.[7–9] In contrast to hydrogenoly-
sis, alkane metathesis allows both lower and higher
homologues to be obtained, and we have shown re-
cently through a combination of structure-reactivity[10]
and kinetic[11] studies that the key carbon-carbon
cleavage and formation process involves olefin meta-
thesis. Other approaches have been investigated to
carry out alkane metathesis. For instance, Chevron
has been using a combination of processes in a single
reactor based on dehydrogenation-hydrogenation cat-
alysts in the presence of olefin metathesis catalysts,[12]
and recently a homogeneous catalytic system based
on the same principle has been reported.[13] In all
cases reported so far, activity and stability of the sys-
tems are still a challenge.
We
have
recently
developed
W-based
systems,
giving higher turnover numbers and having a greater
stability than the corresponding Ta-based systems.
Nonetheless, in the case of W, it is necessary to use an
alumina support because the silica-supported systems
are either inactive or less active. In fact, it has not
been possible to prepare a silica-supported W hydride
so far; one reason being the sintering during the treat-
ment under hydrogen of W-supported species. We
report below the grafting and the characterization of
[WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3], 1, on silica-alumina, the
preparation of the corresponding hydride without sin-
tering, and the activity of these silica-alumina-sup-
ported species in alkane metathesis compared to the
corresponding silica- and alumina-supported systems.

Results and Discussion
Monitoring the reaction of [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3]
(1) with SiO2-Al2O3(500) by IR spectroscopy shows
the following features: a pale yellow colouring of the
disk, a disappearance of the band associated with the
isolated silanol [n(SiOH)=3747 cm1, Figure 1 a and b),
the appearance of (i) a broad band at 3700 cm1 con-
sistent with the presence of remaining silanols in in-
teractions with the grafted organometallic moiet-
ies[14–16] and (ii) two groups of bands in the 3000–
2700 cm1 and 1470–1330 cm1 regions assigned to
n(CH) and d(CH) vibrations of perhydrocarbyl ligands.
When grafting of 1, [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3], was
performed on larger quantities of SiO2-Al2O3–(500) in
the absence of solvent at 668C, a pale yellow solid
was obtained after washing the excess of 1 with anhy-
drous pentane and drying under vacuum. The per-
centage of grafted W typically ranges between 7.5 and
8.3%, that is 0.40–0.45 mmolg1of solid, which shows
that
50%
of
the
initial
OH
of
silica-alumina
(0.88 mmol OH/g) have been consumed in agreement
with what has been observed by IR spectroscopy.
During this process, an average of 0.9 equivs. of 2,2-
dimethylpropane (t-BuCH3) evolved per grafted W, in
agreement with the loss of one neopentyl ligand,
which would have been replaced by a siloxy ligand of
the surface. Moreover, treatment under H2 of this
solid leads to the formation of methane and ethane
through hydrogenolysis of the perhydrocarbyl ligands,
and their amount shows that the solid contained an
average of 14–15 carbons per grafted W. Overall, the
data are consistent with the loss of approximately one
equivalent of 2,2-dimethylpropane during the grafting
process, leaving on average 3 “neopentyl-like” ligands
around the metal centre as expected for the formation
of 2, [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SA (Scheme 1).
Moreover, the 1H and 13C solid state NMR spectra
of this solid (Figure 2 a) display the same signals as
those
observed
for
[(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-
Bu)2]SiO2, prepared by grafting of 1 on SiO2–(700).[17] In
the 1H NMR, the broad signal centred at 1.1 ppm is
assigned to the methyl protons of t-Bu fragments, and
one shoulder is also observed at 2.0 ppm, which can
be attributed to the methylene protons of the neopen-
tyl ligand according to 2D HETCOR solid state
NMR spectroscopy (see Supporting Information, Fig-
ure S1)[18,19] and by analogy with the corresponding
silica-supported complex (Figure 2 a).[17] Similarly, the
13C NMR spectrum of 10%
13C enriched [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C*-t-
Bu)(C*H2-t-Bu)3] grafted on SiO2-Al2O3–(500) (Figure 2
b) displays four signals at 318, 95, 52 and 32 ppm, as-

signed respectively to the carbynic (WC), the meth-
ylene (WCH2-t-Bu), the quaternary carbon of the
neopentylidyne ligand (WCCMe3) and the methyl
groups of the t-Bu [CACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)3], respectively.[17]
In summary, the reaction of [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-
Bu)3] (1) with SiO2-Al2O3–(500) leads to the formation
of a supported organotungsten species whose general
structure can be formulated as [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)-
ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SA (2) in which the tungsten atom is graft-
ed to the surface via one covalent bond (SiOW) as
evidenced by mass balance analysis, IR and NMR
spectroscopy. Moreover, the structure of [1/SiO2-
Al2O3–(500)] was reported earlier to be an alkylidene W
complex because of its high performances in olefin
metathesis.[20] Here, we show that it is in fact a well-
defined alkylidyne complex, and the necessary propa-
gating alkylidene ligand[21] is probably generated in
the presence of olefins as already proposed for other
oxide
supported
group
6
alkylidyne
com-
plexes.[17,18,22,23]
The preparation of the corresponding hydride was
then investigated. When [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-
Bu)2]SA is heated under H2 for 15 h at 1508C, the pale
yellow solid darkens to brown, and the IR spectrum
shows the following (Figure 1 c and d) : i) the disap-
pearance of 95% of the n(CH) and d(CH) bands, ii) the
re-appearance of a band at 3747 cm1 associated with
isolated silanols (20%), iii) the appearance of bands
at 2270 cm1 and in the 1980–1800 cm1 region.
Treatment of this solid with D2 at 808C for 15 min
leads to the disappearance of most of the bands in the
1980–1800 cm1 region (90%) (Supporting Informa-
tion, Figure S2), which are regenerated (95%) upon
treatment with H2 at 808C. Therefore, these bands
can be assigned to n(WH) vibrations. Moreover, one
broad signal of weak intensity at 1910 cm1 remains
unchanged upon treatment under D2: it is assigned to
a n(AlH) vibration by comparison with what is ob-
served for the W hydride supported on alumina.[6]
Similarly, the band at 2270 cm1 is not affected by this
treatment, and can be assigned to a n(SiH).[3–5] Addi-
tionally, the band at 2961 cm1 associated with the re-
sidual alkyl ligands (5%, Figure 1 c) are modified,
while a weak band at 2214 cm1, consistent with n(CD)
vibrations, appears: these CH bonds are associated
to remaining alkyl fragment probably bonded to W.
These observations are already in sharp contrast to
what
has
been
observed
upon
treatment
of
[(SiO)W(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SiO2, for which silanols
are regenerated and no or only weak bands around
1900 cm1 , assigned to WH, appear. Moreover, in
contrast to the tungsten hydride supported on alumi-
na,[6] the IR spectrum of this supported tungsten hy-
dride on silica-alumina, [WH/SiO2-Al2O3]SA (3) show
several tungsten hydride bands, residual surface alkyl
species as well as both SiH and AlH species. These
latter hydride species are probably formed by the re-
action of tungsten hydride intermediates with adja-
cent (SiOSi
) and (SiOAls) bridges,[3–5] thus
providing
bisgrafted
species,
[(SiO)2WHn]
and
[(SiO)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(AlsO)WHn] along with (SiH) and (AlsH).
The absence of SiH2 species (not observed in the IR
spectrum)[4] suggests the absence of formation of tris-
grafted species.
Hydrolysis of these hydrides by reaction with H2O
vapour (30 Torr, 60 equivs.) at room temperature
gives 1.90.2 equivs. of H2/W and 0.30.1 equivs. of
t-BuCH3/W. Moreover, the reaction with 50 equivs. of
CH3I at room temperature gives 0.90.1 equivs. of
CH4 and 0.90.2 equivs. and H2 per W. Hydrolysis of
the resulting powder gives 0.01 H2/W, 0.03 CH4/W and
0.02 t-BuCH3/W, which shows that the reaction of the
metal hydrides with CH3I is complete, and that CH3I
does not react to give a (hydrolysable) WACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH3)I frag-
ment. Overall, the reaction of CH3I shows that the
number of H atoms/W is about 2.7 (0.9 CH4/W+1.8
H/W), some of which can be readily released as H2
and could be associated to WACHTUNGTRENUNG(h2-H2) species. More-
over, the presence of remaining alkyl ligands, ca. 0.3

CH3-t-Bu/W, point out that there are on average 3.0
(H/R) ligands/W. Hydrolysis data (1.9 equivs. of H2/
W) are also consistent with this hypothesis if one con-
siders that half of the measured H2 (0.95 H2) has been
released by de-coordination of H2 from WACHTUNGTRENUNG(h2-H2) spe-
cies and the other half from hydrolysis of WH spe-
cies (0.95 H2). Note that a small amount of H2 proba-
bly comes from the hydrolysis of AlH species (small
amount according to IR spectroscopy, see Supporting
Information Figure S2). Since bisgrafted surface com-
plexes are probably the major species (absence of
SiH2 species), it is therefore possible to propose an
idealized view of surface species as a 1:1 mixture of a
dihydrido and a tetrahydrido species, some of which
(ca. 30%) having an alkyl ligand in place of a hydride
with some W atoms attached to a bissiloxy system
and
others
to
one
siloxy
and
one
aluminoxy
(Scheme 2).
The reactivity of these species is also noteworthy.
Firstly, [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SA (2) is an
active catalyst precursor for the metathesis of pro-
pane under standard reaction conditions (Table 1, see
Supporting Information Table S1 for experimental de-
tails). The initial rate is 0.7 mol propane (P)/mol W/h,
and 30 TON have been reached after 120 h. These
catalytic performances (activity/selectivity) are similar
to those of the corresponding alumina-supported
complex [(AlsO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]Al2O3,[6] while
the corresponding silica-supported system is inactive
even if the spectroscopic features of 2, [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-
t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SA, are identical to these of [(
SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SiO2 and somewhat differ-
ent from these of [(AlsO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]Al2O3.
Secondly, for [W-H/SiO2-Al2O3]SA (3) the initial rate
after 1 h and the number of turnovers after 120 h are
8.5 mol P/mol W/h and 123, respectively. Again, the
silica-alumina-supported tungsten hydride (3) displays
catalytic performances (activity/selectivity) similar to
those of the alumina supported W hydrides (Support-
ing Information, Figure S3).[6] In contrast, the corre-
sponding silica-supported tungsten hydride system is
not very active (10 TON/Wtotal), but in this case, the
presence of only a low amount of active sites, due to
sintering during the preparation, might be the main
origin of this difference. In addition, as observed pre-
viously, linear alkanes are favoured over branched
ones independently of the catalysts used (2 or 3), and
the selectivities of higher homologues are as follows:
Cn+1>Cn+2@Cn+3. The observed selectivities are very
close to those observed for alumina supported W-
based systems and are fully consistent with the model
proposed earlier (Scheme 3),[10,11] which is based on
olefin metathesis intermediates and which predicts
that the favoured pathway for the formation of higher
homologues involves a [1,3]-disubstituted metallacy-
clobutane
rather
than
a
[1,2]-disubstituted
one
(Scheme 3).[24] The higher selectivity of linear versus
branched compounds is also consistent with this

model since the latter would involve the less reactive
disubstituted carbenes. Note also the low amount of
methane, which shows that W-based catalysts are
more selective than the corresponding Ta ones, proba-
bly because they do not catalyse the competitive reac-
tion of alkane hydrogenolysis.[9]
These results show that attaching W to a siloxy
group does not prevent to obtain highly active cata-
lysts, but that alumina, whether as a bulk or in a
silica-alumina, plays a crucial role. One possibility is
that alumina prevents the mobility of surface species
(sintering), and could stabilize surface intermediates
in alkane metathesis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that 1 reacts selectively
on the silanol of a silica alumina partially dehydroxy-
lated at 5008C to provide a well-defined surface spe-
cies 2 [(SiO)WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)2]SA as evidenced
by IR and NMR spectroscopies. Upon treatment with
H2, this surface species further reacts with the oxide
surface to generate probably bisgrafted species ac-
cording to reactivity studies with H2O and CH3I. The
major surface species are best described as a 1:1 mix-
ture of a bis- and a tetrahydride W surface species.
Both species are alkane metathesis catalyst precur-
sors, with activities and selectivities similar to those
observed for the corresponding alumina supported
species, which shows that alumina has a critical role
in the W based systems and could possibly prevent
the mobility of reactive surface species. Further stud-
ies along this line are currently under investigation.
Experimental Section
General Procedures
All experiments were carried out under controlled atmos-
phere, using Schlenk and glove-box techniques for the or-
ganometallic synthesis. For the synthesis and treatments of
the surface species, reactions were carried out using high-
vacuum lines (1.34 Pa) and glove-box techniques. Argon, hy-
drogen and propane were purified over molecular sieve and
deoxo catalysts. Pentane was distilled over Na/K amalgam.
Before use, silica-alumina (HA-S-HPV from Akzo-Nobel:
Si/Al=3 and 390 m2g)1 was calcined under N2/O2 and parti-
ally
dehydroxylated
under
vacuum
at
5008C
(SiO2-
Al2O3–(500)). [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3] (1) was synthesised as
described in the literature.[25]
The preparation of 1* was performed according to the
same procedure as that used for 1, but starting with a 90:10
mixture of non-labeled t-BuCH2Cl and (99% atom
13C)
monolabeled t-BuC*H2Cl to form t-BuCH2MgCl (10% 13C
labelled) as alkylating agents (yield 80–85%); the 99% 13C
monolabeled t-BuC*H2Cl was prepared as previously de-
scribed.[19]

Silica-Alumina-Supported, Tungsten-Based Alkane Metathesis Catalyst
Analyses by gas chromatography were performed using a
KCl/Al2O3 column (50 m, 0.32 mm) equiped with an FID
detector.
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 550
FT spectrometer equipped with a cell designed for in situ re-
actions under controlled atmosphere. Elemental analyses
were performed at the Service Central d’Analyses of CNRS
in Solaize.
1H MAS and 13C CP-MAS solid state NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Avance-500 spectrometer with a con-
ventional double resonance 4 mm CP-MAS probe. The sam-
ples were introduced under Ar in a zirconia rotor, which
was then tightly closed. In all experiments, the rotation fre-
quency was set to 10 kHz. Chemical shifts were given with
respect to TMS as external references for 1H and 13C nuclei.
Monitoring the Grafting of [WACHTUNGTRENUNG(C-t-Bu)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(CH2-t-Bu)3]
on Silica-Alumina and the Formation of the Hydride
by IR Spectroscopy
Silica-alumina (20–50 mg) was pressed into an 17 mm self-
supporting disk, adjusted in the sample holder, and put into
a glass reactor (300 mL) equipped with CaF2 windows. The
support was calcined under N2/O2 and partially dehydroxy-
lated under vacuum at 5008C, SiO2-Al2O3–(500). The com-
pound 1 was then sublimed under dynamic vacuum at 70–
808C onto the oxide disk, which typically turned orange-
yellow. The solid was then heated at 808C for 2 h, and the
excess of 1 was removed by reverse sublimation at 70–808C
and condensed into a lateral tube cooled in liquid N2, which
was then sealed off using a torch. After evacuation under
vacuum
for
30 min,
a
large
excess
of
anhydrous
H2
(77,330 Pa) was introduced, and the solid was heated at
1508C for 15 h. The gaseous products were analysed by GC,
and evacuated. An IR spectrum was recorded after each
step.
Representative Procedure for Grafting of 1 on SiO2-
Al2O3(500) on a Larger Scale [1/SiO2-Al2O3–(500)] (2)
A mixture of 1 (815 mg, 1.75 mmol, 1.2 equivs.) and SiO2-
Al2O3–(500) (3.0 g) was stirred at 668C for 4 h. All volatile
compounds were condensed into another reactor (of known
volume around 5 L) in order to quantify 2,2-dimethylpro-
pane evolved during grafting. Analysis by gas chromatogra-
phy indicated the formation of 1.450.05 mmol of 2,2-dime-
thylpropane (0.90.1 CH3-t-Bu/W). Pentane (10 mL) was
introduced into the reactor by distillation, and the solid was
washed three times. After evaporation of the solvent, the re-
sulting brown powder was dried under vacuum to yield 3.6 g
of [1/SiO2-Al2O3–(500)] (2). Elemental analysis: W 8.3%wt.
Preparation of the W-H/SiO2-Al2O3 (3)
The solid 2 [1/SiO2-Al2O3–(500)] (0.50 g) was heated at 1508C
in the presence of a large excess of anhydrous H2 (77
330 Pa) in a glass reactor of 500 mL. After 15 h, the gaseous
product was quantified by GC. After evacuation of the gas
phase, a second treatment under H2 is performed under the
same experimental conditions.
Representative Procedure for Propane Metathesis
In a glove-box, the solid 2 (45 mg, 20.1 mmole) was intro-
duced in a batch reactor of 500 mL. After evacuation of Ar,
dry propane was added (600 Torr; sub/cat=876), and the re-
action mixture was heated at 1508C. To monitor the reac-
tion, aliquots were expanded in a small volume, brought to
atmospheric pressure with air and analysed by GC. Similar
procedures were used with solid 3 and other catalysts men-
tioned in Table 1 (see Supporting Information Table S1 for
experimental details).
