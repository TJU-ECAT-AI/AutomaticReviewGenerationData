From Olefin to Alkane Metathesis: A Historical Point of View†
Graphical Abstract
Is two better than one? The recent discovery of a homogeneous catalytic system for alkane metathesis is analyzed and compared to other existing systems. The new catalytic system is a combination of two catalysts that carry out dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis (see scheme).
Alkane conversion has been a major focus of petrochemical research for the past century,1–3 and in fact the discovery of olefin metathesis on supported MoO3 or WO3 systems by Banks and Bailey was the result of the investigation of the reactivity of alkane and olefin mixtures on such types of catalysts.4, 5 Under these conditions, only olefins were transformed, which led to the development of very important industrial processes such as the Lummus ABB process, which converts ethylene into propylene through cross-metathesis with 2-butenes on W-based catalysts.6 This discovery was rapidly turned into an alkane conversion process first by Banks (Philipps) and then by Hughes (Chevron)7, 8 by combining heterogeneous dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and olefin metathesis catalysts, which allows a given alkane to be converted into its lower and higher homologues. This reaction [Eq. (2)], like olefin metathesis [Eq. (1)], is thermoneutral (Figure 1), but requires the intermediate formation of olefins from alkanes [Eq. (3)], which is highly disfavored. Therefore, high temperatures are required for high concentration of olefins (Figure 1). For example, in the Chevron process, which relies on a mixture of Pt/Al2O3 (dehydrogenation/hydrogenation) and WO3/SiO2 (metathesis), high temperatures and high pressures are necessary, typically 400 °C and 60 bar (Figure 2).9

In 1997, within a research program targeted at the activation of CH bonds by supported transition-metal catalysts, J.-M. Basset et al. reported the conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and pressures, typically 150 °C and 1 bar, into their lower and higher homologues. The catalyst was a silica-supported tantalum hydride,10 and the reaction was named alkane metathesis by analogy with olefin metathesis (Scheme 1 a). An important research effort in collaboration with BP Chemicals and BP has yielded numerous catalytic systems based on Group 5 and Group 6 hydride and alkyl systems,11–13 and currently the best system is a W hydride supported on alumina (turnover number (TON)=120 after 120 h under ca. 0.8 bar of propane; Scheme 1 b).13 Notably, the catalytic systems based on hydrides give better results under pressure and can be regenerated by treatment under H2.

The subscripts x and y symbolize the number of O and H atoms (x=1 for E=Si, 1<x<3 for E=Al; 1<y<3). c) Proposed reaction pathway with supported hydride catalysts.
Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12, 14 have shown that the key carbon–carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step.15, 16 The transformation of the alkane into an olefin and carbenic propagating species involves additional key elementary steps. It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1 c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product. Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues.17 Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn−1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R′=Cn−2, Scheme 1 c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn−1, Scheme 1 c)
After nearly 30 years without external reports, Chevron has published new patents on their system,18, 19 and just recently a collaborative effort of the groups of Brookhart, Goldman, and Chevron has provided a homogeneous catalytic system related to the original Chevron process,20 but based on a combination of homogeneous catalysts, the Kaska Ir complexes 121–23 as dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, and the Mo imido olefin metathesis catalyst 2 of Schrock24, 25 (Figure 3 a). In the presence of 1 a (L=C2H4) and 2, hexane is converted into a mixture of C2–C14 alkane products (0.75–2.05 M, Figure 3 b), which corresponds to a TON of about 49–128 based on 2.

a) Homogeneous catalytic precursors; in 2: Ar=2,6-iPr2C6H3, R=CMe2Ph, R′= C(CH3)(CF3)2. b) Product distribution y (expressed in mmol L−1) for hexane metathesis (7.6 M) with 1 a (L=C2H4; 10 mM) and 2 (16 mM) after 4 days of reaction at 125 °C (data extracted from reference 20).
It is noteworthy that the reaction takes place at such a low temperature because the amount of olefin must be very low, which shows that both catalysts must be quite efficient. The Ir catalyst precursors can be 1 a, 1 b, or 1 c, but in each case, it is necessary to add an activator, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (2 equiv), a well-known H2 scavenger,26, 27 to the dihydrogen derivative. The catalytic system slowly deactivates with time, and this is mainly a result of the slow decomposition of 2. In fact, adding an extra amount of 2 allows the alkane mixture to be further converted. Notably, the Grubbs-type Ru catalysts28 are not efficient for this system because they are not compatible with complexes 1 (decomposition).
The product distribution (all linear alkanes from C2–C14) clearly indicates that the reaction corresponds to successive steps of dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation. Notably, the products do not arise from the selective metathesis of 1-hexene, the kinetic product of the Ir-based system,29 which would give only the C2 and C10 homologues, but from the cross-metathesis of all hexene isomers. Moreover, the formation of alkanes of carbon number greater than 10 in small amounts is evidence for successive reactions such as the cross-metathesis of hexane (as hexenes) with higher homologues. It is also noteworthy that the distribution of the products is consistent with their formation through nearly a statistical metathesis of an equilibrated mixture of hexene isomers (internal olefins in greater amount than terminal ones leading to homologues of shorter chain lengths compared to those derived from the metathesis of terminal olefins). This is a major difference compared with the systems based on catalysts prepared through surface organometallic chemistry which give mainly the Cn−1 and Cn+1 homologues (see above). Finally, the absence of formation of methane with the homogenous catalytic system shows that the methylidene propagating species (and probably other alkylidene species) does not react with H2 through hydrogenolysis, and that alkanes are solely formed by hydrogenation of olefins at the Ir center.
Moreover, one initiation product, 2-methyl-2-phenylbutane, which probably results from the cross-metathesis of the neophylidene Mo complex 2 and 1-hexene and subsequent hydrogenation, has been detected. More information on 2 through spectroscopy studies have so far been hindered by the presence of many propagating species and deactivation. On the other hand, it was possible to observe the resting states of the Ir systems by monitoring the reaction mixture by NMR: depending on whether 1 a or 1 b is used, it is either the olefin or the dihydrogen complex, respectively. This type of study will probably allow further improvement of the catalytic system based on a structure–reactivity relationship.
Finally, owing to the instability of 2, the combination of the Ir homogeneous catalyst with a heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst, Re2O7 on alumina, has also been investigated. Starting from decane, a distribution of alkane products is also obtained: a TON of 180/Ir has been achieved after three hours, after nine days of reaction this value increases to about 400/Ir. It is noteworthy that the authors have chosen Re-based catalysts because they are usually more susceptible to deactivation at higher temperatures than the analogous Mo- or W-based systems. The latter systems, however, require higher temperatures, which could be detrimental to the Ir catalysts.
The groups of Brookhart and Goldman have reported the first approach to a homogeneous alkane metathesis catalytic system based on the Chevron technology that is the combination of two catalysts: a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalyst and an olefin metathesis catalyst. A first attempt to combine the Ir dehydrogenation catalyst with a more robust heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst, Re2O7/Al2O3, has yielded promising results, and the use of spectroscopic studies has already given some insight about the fate of the homogeneous catalysts, which should lead to the development of better catalytic systems. Thus, new rapid advances in the field of alkane conversions are expected, and significant developments can be anticipated.30 There are still several challenges ahead such as finding stable—easily regenerated—catalysts and achieving a selective transformation of alkanes into a minimum number of homologues.
