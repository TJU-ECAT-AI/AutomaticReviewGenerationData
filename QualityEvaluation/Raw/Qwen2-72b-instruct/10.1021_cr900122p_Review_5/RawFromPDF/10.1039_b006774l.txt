Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set
show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated
aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by
aluminium insertion into a C–H bond, followed by hydrogen
migration to an oxygen atom and predict correctly experi-
mental observations; the alternative pathway involving
alkyl–oxygen interaction has a much higher energy barrier
and does not predict correctly the experimental results.
Following the progress of superacid chemistry, the reactions of
hydrocarbons on aluminosilicates, including zeolites, have been
interpreted as involving the activation by hydron transfer to
form carbocations as intermediates or transition structures.1
This type of activation, characteristic of superacids in solutions,
e.g. HF–SbF5,2 HF–TaF5,3 or H2O–AlX3,4 is not found for
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA), which activates al-
kanes by an oxidative mechanism.5 Yet, TFMSA is a much
stronger acid than the zeolite catalysts.6 This paradox, observ-
able to an outsider, has been lost to the researchers in the
field.
The computations on the activation of alkane C–H bonds
have attempted to describe the accepted mechanism and sought
mostly pathways based on hydron transfer.7 The same held for
the hydrogen chemisorption on alumina, responsible for the
high-temperature H2/D2 exchange,8 which was thought to
involve heterolysis of the H–H bond, with the hydron going to
the oxygen (base) and the hydride to aluminium (acid).9
Standard ab initio (MP2) and DFT (B3LYP) geometry
optimizations with large basis sets and search of the reaction
coordinate without the imposition of a pathway have shown,
however, that hydrogen chemisorption occurs through the
interaction of H2 with the aluminium (metal ion catalysis) until
both hydrogen atoms are bonded to Al, after which one
hydrogen migrates to oxygen.10 The reactivity of aluminium
centers varied in the order: tri- > tetra- > penta-coordinated
and the tetracoordinated aluminium in a silica-alumina cluster
chemisorbed hydrogen by the same mechanism.10b
Alumina catalyzes the H–D exchange of saturated hydro-
carbons as well,11 a reaction also classified as acid–base
catalysis.11 Like the hydrogen chemisorption, the reaction of
methane with Al(OH)3 was described as a heterolytic reaction
with an acid–base pair on the surface, with a hydron going to the
negative oxygen and a methyl anion to the metal.12 A
computational search in which the reaction pathway was not
presupposed was, therefore, in order. We studied the reaction of
propane with aluminium hydroxide clusters, (HO)3Al(OH2)x (1,
x = 0; 2, x = 1).
B3LYP/6-31G** geometry optimizations and frequency
analyses (giving also the zero point energy corrections, ZPE),13
transition structure searching by the STQN (Synchronous
Transit-Guided Quasi Newton) method,14 and reaction pathway
identification by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)15 tracking
were conducted with the Gaussian 98 program,16 as described
before.10 Pathway b (defined below) for chemisorption on 1
was also examined by MP2/6-31G**, to check the agreement
between the two methods (as done in previous work).10a To
model the alumina surface, the geometry of the tricoordinated
aluminium reactant 1 was the optimized geometry of 2, with the
water ligand removed.10 In the reaction of 1 with propane, the
O1–O2–Al–O3 dihedral angle was kept constant. The alter-
native of freezing the outer atoms of the cluster and allowing the
aluminium atom a breathing movement gave a similar potential
energy barrier (PEB) for H2 chemisorption.10a Our goal was to
explore the existence of a reaction pathway, rather than to
determine accurately the relative energies of reactants, inter-
mediates, and transition structures.
Weak complexes of propane with 1 (3) and 2 (4) were located
and two types of chemisorption products were identified, with
C–Al bond (5 and 6, respectively) and with C–O bond (7 and 8,
respectively), shown in eqns. (1) and (2). The relative
reactivities of primary and secondary C–H bonds were also
tested [series a and b in eqns. (1) and (2)]. The O–alkyl
complexes were less stable than the Al–alkyl complexes by 5–7
kcal mol21.

All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen
and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster. The
energies of intermediates and products, relative to the starting
materials, are shown in Table 1.
It is seen that chemisorption and dehydrogenation are
catalyzed by both tricoordinated and tetracoordinated alumin-
ium centers. The former are more reactive, just as for the
hydrogen chemisorption.10 For the aluminium–alkyl pathway,
eqn. (1), a primary C–H bond (a) is more reactive than a
secondary C–H bond (b). Only option b was studied for the O–
alkyl pathway [eqn. (2)], because the alkyl group acquired a
positive charge. On the aluminium–alkyl pathway, the barrier
for alkane chemisorption (TS1) is much smaller than the barrier
(TS2) for the dehydrogenation step, whereas in the oxygen–
alkyl pathway, TS1 is higher in energy than TS2. The O–alkyl
pathway is higher in energy than the aluminium–alkyl pathway.
In the second step of the reaction on 2, the cleavage of an Al–O
bond is easier than the elimination of propene. If the cluster was
part of a solid, the lattice rigidity would determine the degree of
Al–O bond separation. Therefore, the elimination step was
followed at two lengths of the labile Al–O bond: the same as in
the intermediate (6 or 8) and extended by 0.2 Å. Both values are
given in Table 1, for each reaction pathway; the latter are
smaller.
The transition structure for the chemisorption step on the
aluminum–alkyl pathway,14 shown in Fig. 1 (left)17 for the
reaction 1 ? 5a, was similar to that for hydrogen chemisorp-
tion. The imaginary frequency was the bending of the Al–H

bond toward O (migration of hydrogen from Al to O).18 Thus,
the reaction mechanism consists of the insertion of aluminium
into the C–H bond, followed by hydrogen migration from Al to
O, just as for hydrogen chemisorption.10 In the elimination step,
there is less cleavage of the Al–C bond than of the C–H bond at
the transition state (Fig. 1, right).19 For the elimination step of
the O–alkyl pathway, the hydrogen is transferred to another
oxygen atom.
The reactivity order prim > sec and the prediction that
hydrogen exchange [reverse of eqn. (1)] is faster than further
reaction of the olefin (e.g. on acid sites) agrees with the
experiment. (The exchange of H2 with the clusters has lower
barriers than the exchange of the C–H bonds.10) The described
mechanism is relevant for the hydrogen exchange11,19 and
alkene hydrogenation/alkane dehydrogenation.20 These reac-
tions have been described as catalyzed by Brønsted acid centers,
with carbocations as intermediates or transition struc-
tures.7,9,12,21 The cleavage of H–H and C–H bonds by insertion
of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known
for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered
for aluminium. We show now that Al(O–)n sites with n = 3 and
4, are active in metal ion catalysis. An increase in reactivity for
‘broken lattices’ of zeolites or for extraframework aluminium
species in steamed zeolites is predicted.
