Abstract: This overview describes the reaction of organometallics with oxide surfaces and the
formation of highly reactive species. In the case of silica, the surface can be seen as a large
siloxy ligand, which helps to stabilize reactive intermediates through site isolations. This is
translated into very highly reactive and stable well-defined alkene metathesis catalysts as
well as the formation of hydrides species, which display unusual reactivities toward alkanes
(e.g., low-temperature hydrogenolysis and metathesis of alkanes). In the case of alumina, it
allows the formation of highly reactive, but stable cationic species or masked carbenic
species whose structures are unusual by comparison with molecular chemistry.
Keywords: surface; catalysis; organometallic; reactive species; heterogeneous.
INTRODUCTION
Looking for reactivity and stability at the same time seems to be a conundrum, but in fact Nature relies
on this concept. For instance, chemical transformation can be performed with unusual high activity and
selectivity with enzymes. These systems rely on perfectly designed reaction pockets, which combine
molecular recognition properties and site isolation. Thus, for instance, methane is selectively oxidized
by molecular oxygen at room temperature into methanol by methane mono-oxygenase (MMO) [1,2].
Similarly, it is possible to make use of metal oxide surfaces to isolate and stabilize reactive sites, and
thus in turn generate highly active heterogeneous catalyst. This requires a molecular understanding of
surface species via a combined use of advanced spectroscopic and computational studies. Here, we will
illustrate this concept with several examples and show that it is possible to understand and tune the sur-
face of oxide materials, silica and alumina, in order to form well-defined systems, to generate highly
reactive species and to discover unusual reactivity.

On silica
Generalities
Silica surfaces are mainly composed of silanols and siloxane bridges of various types: silanols can be
either isolated, vicinal, or geminal, and siloxane bridges are connected to each other to form cyclic
structures of different sizes, typically 8- to 12-membered rings [3–5]. A thermal treatment at elevated

temperatures leads to the condensation of adjacent silanols yielding water and a siloxane bridge. This
process can be used to control the surface OH density, and at 700 °C the silica surface is mainly com-
posed of isolated silanols, which are statistically distributed at an average distance of ca. 1.3 nm.
Treatment at higher temperatures further decreases the OH density and leads to the formation of reac-
tive siloxane bridges, and this process is further accompanied by a loss of specific surface area. Using
this property, it has been possible to generate well-defined silica-supported systems on silica partially
dehydroxylated at 700 °C, SiO2–(700) by grafting organometallic complexes containing at least one la-
bile ligand [LnM(X)], thus yielding the corresponding monosiloxy complex [(≡SiO)MLn] along with
XH [6]. Overall, this support can be viewed as a large monodentate siloxy ligand (Scheme 1).
Silica-supported metallocarbene
Alkene metathesis is associated with metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane reaction intermediates for
both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems [7–9]. These species have been clearly identified in mo-
lecular organometallic chemistry, and the development of better homogeneous catalysts has relied on
the preparation of well-defined metallocarbenes as catalyst precursors [10]. In contrast, in the case of
classical heterogeneous alkene metathesis catalysts, the catalytic systems are based on group 6 or 7
transition-metal oxide dispersed on oxide supports, and the metallacarbene species have never been di-
rectly observed and are probably formed in situ in the presence of the alkene reagent. Additionally,
these systems typically have a low number of active sites, which has prevented to obtain a direct evi-
dence for the formation of these intermediates despite extensive studies [11,12]. For instance, for
Re2O7/Al2O3, a highly active system working at room temperature, the number of active sites has been
estimated to ca. 2 mol %, the Lewis acidity has been identified to be critical, but the formation of the
carbene intermediate is still a matter of debate [13–15]. Thus, one question arises: is it possible to gen-
erate a well-defined Re carbene on a surface, active in alkene metathesis? 
With this in mind and the accumulated knowledge in the molecular organometallic chemistry of
Re [16], the controlled reaction of a Re molecular complex, [Re(≡CtBu)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] and
SiO2–(700) was attempted, and yielded a well-defined silica-supported Re carbene complex,
[(≡SiO)Re(≡CtBu)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], (Scheme 2a) as evidenced by mass balance analysis and the
use of multiple complementary spectroscopic techniques (IR, solid-state NMR, and extended X-ray ab-
sorption fine structure, EXAFS) [17,18]. It is noteworthy that this system turned out to be a highly re-
active alkene metathesis heterogeneous catalyst with the following specific properties [17,19,20]: 
•
well-defined active sites (fast initiation, observation of the stoichiometric amount of cross-
metathesis products), 
•
activities greater than these of Re2O7/Al2O3 and comparable to the best homogeneous d0 catalysts,

•
compatibility with functional groups without the need of a co-catalyst in contrast to
Re2O7/Al2O3, and
•
unexpected formation of 1-butene as a primary product during the metathesis of propene (98 %
selectivity in 2-butenes).
The combined use of experimental and computational studies have shown that the high reactivity
of this system was due to the asymmetry at the metal center, that is the presence of both a strong and a
weaker σ-donor ligands, the neopentyl and the siloxy groups, respectively (Scheme 2b) [21,22]. Alkene
metathesis is best described as a four-step process: coordination, [2+2]-cycloaddition and the corre-
sponding reverse step, cycloreversion, and de-coordination. The asymmetry at the metal center is thus
optimal because (1) in the first step (coordination), the activation energy associated to the distortion of
the metal fragment from a tetrahedron into a trigonal prism is lowered when the incoming alkene coor-
dinates trans to the strong σ-donor ligand while the less σ-donor ligand enters the basal plane contain-
ing the alkylidene and the alkylidyne ligands and (2) it forms a less stable metallacyclobutane at the
second step ([2+2]-cycloaddition) because the strong σ-donor ligand has to share the basal planes with
the two metal-alkyl bonds of the metallacyclobutane. 
With the notion that Mo alkylidene complexes are usually more efficient catalysts [9], the de-
velopment of isoelectronic Mo molecular complex [Mo(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]2 [23] has led to
the preparation of corresponding silica-supported system [(≡SiO)Mo(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)],
which have been characterized at a molecular level (Scheme 3) [24,25]. It is noteworthy that this sys-

[(R3SiO)Mo(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], which clearly shows that they are very similar in nature. In
fact, they also display similar reactivities as evidenced by similar initial rates in the metathesis of
1-octene. However, the difficulty of achieving full conversion for the molecular complex (longer re-
action time) clearly shows that it is not as stable as the silica-supported system, and this shows the sta-
bilization of reactive intermediates on silica surfaces and the advantage of site isolation. 
Additionally, it is noteworthy that, on going from Re to Mo, the initial activity is not improved,
but that the better selectivity (99.4 %) and stability of the Mo system make it an overall better catalyst
(Table 1). In contrast, on going from Mo to W, the selectivity is the same, the stability is greater, but the
low rates make the W system not as efficient in terms of overall turnover number (TON) [26]. Further
improvement of the catalyst was obtained by replacing the pending neopentyl by amido ligands
[(≡SiO)M(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(NR2)], for which initial activities (ca. × 3; with >300 mol/mol/min for Mo),
selectivities (>99.9 %), and stabilities are greatly improved so that much higher TON can be achieved
(138000) [27,28]. Finally, modifying the imido ligand was also successful in improving the overall per-
formances of the catalytic system, yielding up to 275 000 using a combination of 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl
and adamantylimido ligands.

A similar beneficial effect is found upon changing the neopentyl by a 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl lig-
and in the case of the isoelectronic W complexes [(≡SiO)W(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(X)] (X = CH2tBu vs.
NR2) [26,29] improved initial rate, selectivity, and stability, clearly showing the problem associated
with the neopentyl ligand. However, despite a much greater stability than this observed for Mo and Re
systems, the rate of metathesis is still slow and the overall performances are lower than those of Mo.
This can be associated with the greater stability of the metallacyclobutanes, which can be observed in
some cases [30]. In fact, the reaction of [(≡SiO)W(≡NAr)(=CHtBu)(NR2)] with 13C di-labelled ethene
gives a mixture of methylidene and metallacyclobutane species (Scheme 4), the latter being present as
square-based pyramid and trigonal bipyramid isomers in a roughly one-to-one ratio [29]. It is notewor-
thy that the catalyst precursor and these intermediates have roughly the same reactivity (rates and sta-
bility), which clearly shows, for the first time in heterogeneous catalysis, that the methylidene and the
metallacyclobutane species are indeed reaction intermediates of alkene metathesis.
Silica-supported metal hydrides
Upon treatment of supported perhydrocarbyl complexes under H2 at high temperatures (ca. 150 °C),
these systems evolve into mononuclear metal hydride surface complexes, through successive steps in-
volving (1) the formation of putative hydride siloxy intermediates, [(≡SiO)MHx], and (2) the reaction
of these species with adjacent siloxane bridges leading to the formation of new M–O bonds with the
concomitant formation of Si–H surface species (Scheme 5) [31–33]. Because of the heterogeneity of
the local environment (silica is amorphous), it typically leads to a mixture of surface species. For in-
stance, [(≡SiO)Zr(CH2tBu)3] is transformed into a mixture of [(≡SiO)3Zr–H] and [(≡SiO)2Zr(–H)2],
[Zr–H] [34], while [(≡SiO)Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] gives [(≡SiO)2Ta–Hx], [Ta–H] (x = 1 and 3)
[35,36].

Scheme 4
Not surprisingly, the relative unsaturated coordination sphere of these species—formally 8 and 10
electron species—make them highly reactive. In fact, silica-supported Zr and Ta hydrides react catalyt-
ically with alkanes at low temperatures as follows (Scheme 6):
•
Low-temperature H/D exchange reactions of D2/CH4 mixtures [37,38]: this probably takes place
for both systems, [Zr–H] and [Ta–H], via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism [39]. 
•
Hydrogenolysis of alkanes [40,41]: while [Ta–H] eventually transforms any acyclic alkanes into
methane, [Zr–H] does not hydrogenolyze the C–C bond of ethane, which leads to mixtures of
ethane and methane. This is due to the different nature of the surface species and the associated
reaction mechanisms of C–C cleavage: α- vs. β-alkyl transfer for [Ta–H] and [Zr–H], respec-
tively. 
•
Alkane metathesis: at 150 °C, [Ta–H] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,
and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re-
action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key C–C bond formation/cleav-
age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [43–46]. More recently, it has been shown that [Zr–H] can
also catalyze this reaction, but it leads to different products [47]. For instance, propane is con-
verted into mainly methane, ethane, and 2-methylpropane. It has been proposed that this reaction
involves a bis-hydride species and a different mechanism (β-alkyl transfer/insertion processes).
•
Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using
[Ta–H] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis. 
•
Non-oxidative coupling of methane [49]: this reaction is highly endothermic, leading to low con-
versions, and involves the C–H activation of methane on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates.

Scheme 5
The formation of these surface hydrides has been limited to early transition metals, and, in fact, tung-
sten hydrides cannot be generated quantitatively on pure silica and requires alumina-containing sup-
ports [50,51]. Additionally, Mo and Re hydrides have not been obtained on either silica or alumina.
Attempts to generate late transition-metal hydrides (group VIII) on oxide supports have always lead to
sintering and formation of metal particles [52]. However, it has recently been shown that tuning the sur-
face of silica with surface hydrides allows the formation of stable mononuclear Ru hydride surface
species (Scheme 7) [53]. Note that in contrast, a similar approach on silica leads to the formation of reg-
ularly distributed Ru particles. It is noteworthy that the mononuclear system is able to hydrogenate se-
lectively the double bond of styrene without touching the aromatic ring even at very high conversion in
contrast to the corresponding silica-supported nanoparticles [53b].

On alumina
Generalities
The surface of alumina is more complex than this of silica. Indeed, in contrast to silica, in which Si is
always tetracoordinated and mainly tetrahedral, the Al atoms of the bulk of transition aluminas (γ or δ)
are found in two geometries, tetrahedral (AlTd) or octahedral (AlOh) geometries, whose ratio
(AlTd/AlOh) is ca. 1:3 for γ-Al2O3. Considering the surface Al atoms, they will therefore have different
natures (tri-, tetra-, penta-, or hexacoordinated) depending on the origin of the Al atom (AlTd/AlOh) and
the level of hydration of the surface. This will in turn induce a variety of Lewis acid (AlV, AlIV, and
AlIII) and hydroxyl sites (AlIV–OH, AlV–OH, AlVI–OH as well as µ2- and µ3-OH; Scheme 8a). The
combination of spectroscopic data and computational studies clearly shows that the (1,1,0) surface is
the most abundant (ca. 70 %) and contains the OH groups [54,55]. Moreover, while the nature of the
OH species is best described by a trihydrated alumina per unit cell, other studies clearly show that there

must be some more dehydrated unit cell as evidenced by the presence of very reactive Lewis acid sites
(Scheme 8b), which react with H2 and CH4 via heterolytic splitting, yielding the corresponding AlS–H
and AlS–CH3 surface species (Scheme 8c) [56]. In fact, CH4 reacts only with AlIII, while H2 reacts with
both AlIII and AlIV.
Surface complexes: From cationic species to masked carbenes
The reaction of [Zr(CH2tBu)4] with Al2O3–(500) yields 2 equiv of tBuCH3 per grafted Zr, and the com-
bined used of spectroscopic (IR and solid-state NMR) and computational studies are in agreement with
the formation of cationic surface species, which result from, first, a protonolysis of two Zr–C bonds
by surface OH groups followed by a transfer of one of the remaining neopentyl ligand onto an adja-
cent AlS site (Scheme 9) [57]. This is in contrast to what is observed on SiO2–(700), which yields a neu-
tral species, [(≡SiO)Zr(CH2tBu)3]. These results fully explain the difference of reactivities of alumina
vs. silica-supported systems: the former is a highly active polymerization catalyst, while the latter is
totally inactive [58–61]. Note, however, that the formation of cationic species on alumina is not gen-
eral, and, for instance, grafting of [W(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] on Al2O3–(500) generates the corresponding
monoaluminoxy surface species [(AlSO)W(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], which interacts with surrounding OH
groups.
In some cases, grafting does not occur on OH groups, but on the Lewis acid sites. For instance,
the reaction of MeReO3 with Al2O3–(500) yields both coordination complexes [AlS(O3ReMe)] and
[AlS(CH2ReO3)] species in a 85:15 ratio (Scheme 10a); the latter resulting from the C–H activation of
the methyl ligand of MeReO3 onto reactive AlS–O sites (as already discussed for H2 and CH4) [62].
While this system is a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst, no carbenic species have been detected.
Additionally, while [AlS(O3ReMe)] is not reactive, [AlS(CH2ReO3)] can exchange its methylene lig-
ands, and in fact both [AlS(CH2ReO3)] and [AlS(CH(CH3)ReO3)] have been observed in the metathesis
of propene. They probably correspond to the resting states of the catalyst, and the actual propagating
carbene species is formed in situ in the presence of alkenes (Scheme 10b) [62,63].

CONCLUSION
Oxide surfaces can be indeed exploited to generate highly reactive species. In the case of silica, it is
possible to control the OH density through a thermal pretreatment and therefore to guarantee the site
isolation of well-defined surface organometallic complexes, which can be used as reactive and stable
single-site catalyst precursors. Furthermore, under H2, it is also possible to generate mononuclear hy-
dride species, with unusual structure, stability, and reactivity, which allows the catalytically transfor-
mation of unactivated alkanes at low temperatures. While the formation of these hydride species on
oxide surfaces is limited to early transition metals, which have strong M–O bond, it is possible to ex-
tend this approach to late transition metals by tuning the surface of silica with silanes and the forma-
tion of strong Si–Ru bonds, which are stable at relative high temperatures. Finally, in the case of alu-
mina, the thermal treatment does not only allow the control of the OH density, but also generates the
formation of Lewis acid sites and defect sites. These sites are very reactive: (1) they can abstract the ad-
jacent alkyl group of a supported species to form cationic species and (2) they can even react with H–H
or C–H bonds, and in the specific case of MeReO3 generates at room temperature AlSCH2ReO3 species,
which is the active site of a highly active alkene metathesis catalyst. It is therefore clear through these
examples that surfaces can stabilize reactive species, and we are currently further investigating this con-
cept to discover unusual systems and new reactivities.
