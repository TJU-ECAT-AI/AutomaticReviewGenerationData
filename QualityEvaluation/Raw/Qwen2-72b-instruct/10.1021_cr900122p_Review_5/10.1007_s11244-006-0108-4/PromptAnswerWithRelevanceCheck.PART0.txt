Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it does mention that the reaction begins with the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes. The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones, suggesting that the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane is less favored with tungsten than tantalum.

1.文献没有提供硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的全面机制。但是，它确实提到反应开始于钽氢化物对烷基的CH键的活化，形成表面钽烷基复合物。从这个复合物中，可以通过α-H和β-H的抽象得到羰基氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。羰基和烯烃的相互作用可以导致钽环丁烷的形成，该环丁烷分解产生新的羰基和新的烯烃。这些物种的氢化产生新的烷基。在烷基化反应中，产物的选择性由金属环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用控制。与钽相比，基于钨的催化剂产生更窄的产物分布，表明1,2-二取代的金属环丁烷在钨中不如在钽中受青睐。
