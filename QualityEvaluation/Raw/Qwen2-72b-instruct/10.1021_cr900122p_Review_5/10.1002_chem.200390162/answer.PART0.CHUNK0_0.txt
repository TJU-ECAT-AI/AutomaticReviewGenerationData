[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
[2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
[3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
[4] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction,12 while the formation of acyclic alkanes probably arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane (vide infra for mechanistic discussion) followed by the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the open alkane chains."
[5] "In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."
[6] "Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3."
[7] "The activation of CH bonds is often faster than that of CC bonds, despite the lower bond energies of the latter.17"
[8] "The CH bond activation of cycloheptane on the surface complex 1 would give 4."
[9] "This surface complex can itself participate in various intramolecular CC and CH bond activations."
[10] "While the first two processes can be involved in H-scrambling reactions, they do not contribute to carboncarbon activation."
[11] "On the other hand, the latter generates a metallacyclobutane 5, which is a key intermediate for carboncarbon cleavage, for example, in olefin metathesis (Scheme 4, Pathway 3)."
[12] "The intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
[13] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
[14] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
[15] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
[16] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
[17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

1.The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that includes both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site scheme, the initial step is the activation of the alkane by the hydride complex, forming an alkyl intermediate. This intermediate can then undergo various reactions, including hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and metathesis, leading to the formation of different products. In the one-site scheme, the alkane is activated by a single metal center, leading to the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can then undergo ring opening, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic or acyclic alkanes. The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the stability of the intermediates and the energy barriers of the different reaction pathways. The formation of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The alkenes can undergo further reactions, such as hydrogenation or metathesis, leading to the formation of different products. The metallacyclobutanes can undergo ring opening, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic or acyclic alkanes. The catalyst performance is influenced by the stability of the intermediates and the energy barriers of the different reaction pathways. The selectivity of the reaction can be improved by optimizing the reaction conditions and the catalyst structure.
