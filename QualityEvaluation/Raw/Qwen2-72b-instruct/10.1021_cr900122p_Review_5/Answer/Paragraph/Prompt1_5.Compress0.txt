From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes.

Ethane is transformed into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane at room temperature. Higher and lower homologs are obtained from propane, butane, and pentane, as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. The mechanism likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. Cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic reactions, while acyclic alkanes do, leading to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and does not present any problem of selectivity. When higher linear alkanes are used, several higher and lower homologs are produced because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved. Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also undergo the metathesis reaction, but neopentane only leads to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and does not react further, probably for steric reasons. During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand. The mechanism of the reaction involves the cleavage of a C-H bond of acyclic alkane, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. This mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane. The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution. The C-H bond activation step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored for steric reasons, but the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.", "Doi": "10.1126/science.276.5309.99"},

The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).

During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand.

For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.

The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.", "Doi": "10.1002/chem.200390162"}
