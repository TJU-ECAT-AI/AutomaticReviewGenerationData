The comprehensive mechanistic investigation of alkane metathesis processes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, as detailed in reference \[10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4\], elucidates the pivotal role of CH bond activation in initiating the transformation, leading to the formation of a surface tantalum alkyl complex. This complex further evolves into carbene hydride and olefin hydride species through alpha-H and beta-H abstractions, which interact to create a tantalum cyclobutane intermediate. Decomposition of this intermediate yields new carbene and olefin species, which are hydrogenated to produce new alkanes. The selectivity of the products is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions in metallacyclobutane intermediates, with tantalum catalysts offering a broader product distribution than tungsten-based ones, indicating a preference for 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediates \[10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4\].

                    At 150 degrees Celsius, silica-supported tantalum hydrides catalyze alkane metathesis, exemplified by the conversion of propane to ethane and butane \[10.1351/pac-con-08-07-18\]. This process involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with pi-bond metathesis playing a key role in carbon-carbon bond formation and cleavage, crucial for reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

                    The two-site mechanism, as described in reference \[10.1021/cr900122\], involves tantalum hydrides as intermediates, generating alkenes via β-H transfer and evolving toward Ta-alkylidene hydrides via α-H transfer. Alkenes undergo homologation, leading to different alkenes and alkylidene species, with subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis liberating lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism forms tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates in situ, with alkene intermediates converting within the metal center's coordination sphere. Selectivity favors n + 1 linear homologues due to alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, yield lower cyclic homologues through hydrogenolysis. Metallacyclobutane intermediates, formed after γ-H activation, undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to produce cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues \[10.1021/cr900122\].
