          [1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
          [9] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

          The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The key process in this mechanism is π-bond metathesis, which involves the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, leading to the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this process. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been a long-term goal, but so far, all introduced ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The metathesis of propane, for example, results in the formation of ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of initiation products is based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site or involve two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

          由硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的机制涉及在低温下将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物，这对于优化石油资源至关重要。该机制的关键过程是π-键化，涉及烯烃和卡宾的相互作用，导致碳-碳键的断裂和形成。烷基化氢化物是这一过程中的关键中间体。引入辅助配体，可以控制催化剂的反应性和选择性，一直是长期目标，但到目前为止，所有引入的配体都对催化剂性能有害。例如，丙烷的化反应导致乙烷、丁烷、甲烷、异丁烷和戊烷的形成。起始产物的选择性基于为烯烃化开发的模型，该模型最小化了金属环丁烷中间体中的立体相互作用。该机制可以基于单个位点，也可以涉及两个位点，一个用于生成烯烃，另一个用于化反应。较低的烷基同系物是通过在碳烯中间体上通过CH活化进行配体交换和α-H抽提过程形成的。
