The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, it does mention that the reaction begins with the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes. The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones, suggesting that the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane is less favored with tungsten than tantalum.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After the initial CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The selectivity in higher homologues, mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. Various cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. Several catalysts have been developed based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes, including tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports, which display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it discusses the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The literature also reports the unexpected transformation of 2-methylpropane to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutene catalyzed by an alumina-supported tungsten hydride, which involves the selective transfer of two carbons, a process not previously observed in alkane metathesis.

The silica-supported transition metal hydrides catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperatures. Ethane is transformed into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane at room temperature. Higher and lower homologs are obtained from propane, butane, and pentane, as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. The mechanism likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. Cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic reactions, while acyclic alkanes do, leading to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and does not present any problem of selectivity. When higher linear alkanes are used, several higher and lower homologs are produced because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved. Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also undergo the metathesis reaction, but neopentane only leads to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and does not react further, probably for steric reasons. During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand. The mechanism of the reaction involves the cleavage of a C-H bond of acyclic alkane, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. This mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane. The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution. The C-H bond activation step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored for steric reasons, but the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The key process in this mechanism is π-bond metathesis, which involves the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, leading to the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this process. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been a long-term goal, but so far, all introduced ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The metathesis of propane, for example, results in the formation of ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of initiation products is based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site or involve two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. After initial CH bond activation, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkenes and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. Catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes have been developed, with tungsten hydrides supported on oxide supports showing higher stability and selectivity than tantalum hydrides. The selectivity in higher homologues is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes mainly participating in the homologation process. Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after CH bond activation, forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane. The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. After initial CH bond activation, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkenes and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. Catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes have been developed, with tungsten hydrides supported on oxide supports showing higher stability and selectivity than tantalum hydrides. The selectivity in higher homologues is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes mainly participating in the homologation process. Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after CH bond activation, forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane. The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, it does mention that the reaction begins with the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes. The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones, suggesting that the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane is less favored with tungsten than tantalum.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After the initial CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The selectivity in higher homologues, mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. Various cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. Several catalysts have been developed based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes, including tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports, which display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it discusses the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The literature also reports the unexpected transformation of 2-methylpropane to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutene catalyzed by an alumina-supported tungsten hydride, which involves the selective transfer of two carbons, a process not previously observed in alkane metathesis.

The silica-supported transition metal hydrides catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperatures. Ethane is transformed into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane at room temperature. Higher and lower homologs are obtained from propane, butane, and pentane, as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. The mechanism likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. Cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic reactions, while acyclic alkanes do, leading to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and does not present any problem of selectivity. When higher linear alkanes are used, several higher and lower homologs are produced because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved. Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also undergo the metathesis reaction, but neopentane only leads to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and does not react further, probably for steric reasons. During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand. The mechanism of the reaction involves the cleavage of a C-H bond of acyclic alkane, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. This mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane. The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution. The C-H bond activation step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored for steric reasons, but the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The key process in this mechanism is π-bond metathesis, which involves the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, leading to the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this process. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been a long-term goal, but so far, all introduced ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The metathesis of propane, for example, results in the formation of ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of initiation products is based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site or involve two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The literature also reports the unexpected transformation of 2-methylpropane to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutene catalyzed by an alumina-supported tungsten hydride, which involves the selective transfer of two carbons, a process not previously observed in alkane metathesis.

The silica-supported transition metal hydrides catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperatures. Ethane is transformed into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane at room temperature. Higher and lower homologs are obtained from propane, butane, and pentane, as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. The mechanism likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. Cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic reactions, while acyclic alkanes do, leading to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and does not present any problem of selectivity. When higher linear alkanes are used, several higher and lower homologs are produced because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved. Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also undergo the metathesis reaction, but neopentane only leads to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and does not react further, probably for steric reasons. During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand. The mechanism of the reaction involves the cleavage of a C-H bond of acyclic alkane, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. This mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane. The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution. The C-H bond activation step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored for steric reasons, but the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The key process in this mechanism is π-bond metathesis, which involves the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, leading to the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this process. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been a long-term goal, but so far, all introduced ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The metathesis of propane, for example, results in the formation of ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of initiation products is based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site or involve two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. After initial CH bond activation, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkenes and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. Catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes have been developed, with tungsten hydrides supported on oxide supports showing higher stability and selectivity than tantalum hydrides. The selectivity in higher homologues is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes mainly participating in the homologation process. Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after CH bond activation, forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane. The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, it does mention that the reaction begins with the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes. The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones, suggesting that the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane is less favored with tungsten than tantalum.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After the initial CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The selectivity in higher homologues, mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. Various cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. Several catalysts have been developed based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes, including tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports, which display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it discusses the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, including two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. However, it does mention that the reaction begins with the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex. From this complex, a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can result from alpha-H and beta-H abstractions. The interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantalum cyclobutane, which decomposes to afford a new carbene and a new olefin. The hydrogenation of these species produces the new alkanes. The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. Tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones, suggesting that the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane is less favored with tungsten than tantalum.

Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The two-site mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After the initial CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. The selectivity in higher homologues, mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process. Various cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. Several catalysts have been developed based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes, including tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports, which display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it discusses the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The literature also reports the unexpected transformation of 2-methylpropane to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutene catalyzed by an alumina-supported tungsten hydride, which involves the selective transfer of two carbons, a process not previously observed in alkane metathesis.

The silica-supported transition metal hydrides catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperatures. Ethane is transformed into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane at room temperature. Higher and lower homologs are obtained from propane, butane, and pentane, as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane. The mechanism likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane. Cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic reactions, while acyclic alkanes do, leading to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane, which has only one C-C bond and does not present any problem of selectivity. When higher linear alkanes are used, several higher and lower homologs are produced because various C-H and C-C bonds can be involved. Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also undergo the metathesis reaction, but neopentane only leads to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tantalum-neopentyl species and does not react further, probably for steric reasons. During the metathesis reaction, the tantalum hydride disappears and is transformed into a tantalum-alkyl intermediate. In the case of ethane, the C-C bond formation and cleavage enable the liberation of propane and the formation of a tantalum-methyl surface complex. The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tantalum-ethyl surface complex. A new four-centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand. The mechanism of the reaction involves the cleavage of a C-H bond of acyclic alkane, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl species. The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. This mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes. The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n-butane and isobutane as well as the formation of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane. The metathesis of isobutane is particularly interesting with respect to the product distribution. The C-H bond activation step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The formation of the tantalum-tert-butyl species can be disfavored for steric reasons, but the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum-tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the transformation of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues at low temperatures, which is crucial for optimizing oil resources. The key process in this mechanism is π-bond metathesis, which involves the interaction of an olefin and a carbene, leading to the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in this process. The introduction of ancillary ligands, which can control the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts, has been a long-term goal, but so far, all introduced ligands have been detrimental to catalyst performance. The metathesis of propane, for example, results in the formation of ethane, butane, methane, isobutane, and pentanes. The selectivity of initiation products is based on the model developed for olefin metathesis, which minimizes steric interactions in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates. The mechanism can be based on a single-site or involve two sites, one for olefin generation and the other for metathesis. Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via CH activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. After initial CH bond activation, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to different alkenes and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate lower and higher alkane homologues. In the one-site mechanism, tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates are formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center. Both mechanisms involve alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. Catalysts based on well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes have been developed, with tungsten hydrides supported on oxide supports showing higher stability and selectivity than tantalum hydrides. The selectivity in higher homologues is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes mainly participating in the homologation process. Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves γ-H activation after CH bond activation, forming a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane. The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carbon-carbon bond-cleavage step. The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis is due to its reaction with the catalyst to form a cyclopentyl derivative, which evolves into a cyclopentadienyl derivative, an inactive complex in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes. This deactivation pathway is responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. The hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on silica-supported tantalum hydrides shows a trend in ring size dependence, yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides. Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings. The formation of smaller cyclic products can be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. The intermediate 4 can undergo intramolecular activation of a carbon-carbon bond in the α or β position, leading to different intermediates. Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer, which gives an intermediate 11 that can transform into intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps. The former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer, but it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products. On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained. Carbon-carbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer, depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex). This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane). Most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carbon-carbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals. In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanism, which is very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)). This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and silica-supported tantalum hydrides.
