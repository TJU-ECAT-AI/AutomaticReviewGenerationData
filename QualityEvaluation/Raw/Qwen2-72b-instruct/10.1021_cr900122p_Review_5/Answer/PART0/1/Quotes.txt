• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346].

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). (251, 252) In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
          [3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones. (298, 305-309)"
          [4] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."
          [5] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."



[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Higher and lower homologs were obtained from propane,butane, and pentane as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane."
          [4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
          [5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13),no catalytic reaction occurred."
          [6] "When pa],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."
          [7] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. which has onlv one C 4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
          [8] "When higher linear alkanes were used,several higher and lower homologs were pro- duced, because various G H and C-C bonds can be involved."
          [9] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reac- tion; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- ther, probably for steric reasons."
          [10] "During the metathesis reaction, infrared spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- dride disappeared and was transformed into a tantalum-alkvl intermediate."
          [11] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- pane and the formation of a tantalum- methyl surface complex."
          [12] "The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tan- talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [13] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- & , example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- mentary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."
          [14] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- mation of C-C bonds."
          [15] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [17] "The metathesis of isobutane is particu- larly interesting with respect to the product distribution. In agreement with the pro- posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates (Scheme 4)."
          [18] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert- butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
          [9] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

          [8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
          [9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."
          [10] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
          [2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
          [3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
          [4] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
          [5] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
          [6] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
          [7] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."
          [8] "Secondly, the intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
          [9] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
          [10] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
          [11] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
          [12] "Carboncarbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer,23 depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex)."
          [13] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
          [14] "Note that most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carboncarbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.19"
          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

          [5] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
          [6] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
          [7] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."
          [8] "Secondly, the intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
          [9] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
          [10] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
          [11] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
          [12] "Carboncarbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer,23 depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex)."
          [13] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
          [14] "Note that most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carboncarbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.19"
          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."



• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346].

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). (251, 252) In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
          [3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones. (298, 305-309)"
          [4] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."
          [5] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."



[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Higher and lower homologs were obtained from propane,butane, and pentane as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane."
          [4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
          [5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13),no catalytic reaction occurred."
          [6] "When pa],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."
          [7] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. which has onlv one C 4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
          [8] "When higher linear alkanes were used,several higher and lower homologs were pro- duced, because various G H and C-C bonds can be involved."
          [9] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reac- tion; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- ther, probably for steric reasons."
          [10] "During the metathesis reaction, infrared spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- dride disappeared and was transformed into a tantalum-alkvl intermediate."
          [11] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- pane and the formation of a tantalum- methyl surface complex."
          [12] "The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tan- talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [13] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- & , example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- mentary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."
          [14] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- mation of C-C bonds."
          [15] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [17] "The metathesis of isobutane is particu- larly interesting with respect to the product distribution. In agreement with the pro- posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates (Scheme 4)."
          [18] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert- butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."

          [8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
          [9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."

          [2] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
          [3] "The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [4] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
          [5] "In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
          [6] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."
          [7] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones."
          [8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
          [9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."
          [10] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
          [2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
          [3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
          [4] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
          [5] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
          [6] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
          [7] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."
          [8] "Secondly, the intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
          [9] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
          [10] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
          [11] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
          [12] "Carboncarbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer,23 depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex)."
          [13] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
          [14] "Note that most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carboncarbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.19"
          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."



• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346].

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). (251, 252) In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."

(298, 305-309)"
          [4] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."
          [5] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."



[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Higher and lower homologs were obtained from propane,butane, and pentane as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane."
          [4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
          [5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13),no catalytic reaction occurred."
          [6] "When pa],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."
          [7] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. which has onlv one C 4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
          [8] "When higher linear alkanes were used,several higher and lower homologs were pro- duced, because various G H and C-C bonds can be involved."
          [9] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reac- tion; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- ther, probably for steric reasons."
          [10] "During the metathesis reaction, infrared spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- dride disappeared and was transformed into a tantalum-alkvl intermediate."
          [11] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- pane and the formation of a tantalum- methyl surface complex."
          [12] "The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tan- talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [13] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- & , example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- mentary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."
          [14] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- mation of C-C bonds."
          [15] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [17] "The metathesis of isobutane is particu- larly interesting with respect to the product distribution. In agreement with the pro- posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates (Scheme 4)."
          [18] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert- butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
          [9] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [17] "The metathesis of isobutane is particu- larly interesting with respect to the product distribution. In agreement with the pro- posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates (Scheme 4)."
          [18] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert- butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
          [9] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

          [2] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
          [3] "The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [4] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
          [5] "In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
          [6] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."
          [7] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones."
          [8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
          [9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."
          [10] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
          [2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
          [3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
          [4] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
          [5] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
          [6] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
          [7] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."
          [8] "Secondly, the intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
          [9] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
          [10] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
          [11] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
          [12] "Carboncarbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer,23 depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex)."
          [13] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
          [14] "Note that most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carboncarbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.19"
          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."



• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42].

          [5] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."



[1] "The silica-supported transition metal hydrides (23-0-Siz)(=Si-0-),Ta-H and (Si-0-),M-H (M, chromium or tungsten) catalyze the metathesis reaction of linear or branched alkanes into the next higher and lower alkanes at moderate temperature (25" to 200C)."
          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Higher and lower homologs were obtained from propane,butane, and pentane as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane."
          [4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
          [5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13),no catalytic reaction occurred."
          [6] "When pa],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."
          [7] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. which has onlv one C 4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
          [8] "When higher linear alkanes were used,several higher and lower homologs were pro- duced, because various G H and C-C bonds can be involved."
          [9] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reac- tion; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- ther, probably for steric reasons."
          [10] "During the metathesis reaction, infrared spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- dride disappeared and was transformed into a tantalum-alkvl intermediate."
          [11] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- pane and the formation of a tantalum- methyl surface complex."
          [12] "The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tan- talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [13] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- & , example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- mentary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."
          [14] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- mation of C-C bonds."
          [15] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."

          [2] "With (Si-0-Si=)(=Si-0-),Ta-H, ethane was transformed at room temperature into an equimolar mixture of propane and methane."
          [3] "Higher and lower homologs were obtained from propane,butane, and pentane as well as from branched alkanes such as isobutane and isopentane."
          [4] "The mechanism of the step leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation likely involves a four-centered transition state between a tantalum-alkyl intermediate and a carbon-carbon a-bond of a second molecule of alkane."
          [5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13),no catalytic reaction occurred."
          [6] "When pa],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."
          [7] "The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. which has onlv one C 4 bond and consequently does not present any problem of selectivity."
          [8] "When higher linear alkanes were used,several higher and lower homologs were pro- duced, because various G H and C-C bonds can be involved."
          [9] "Branched alkanes such as isobutane or methyl butane also underwent the metathesis reac- tion; however, neopentane only led to the stoichiometric formation of a surface tanta- lum-neopentyl species and did not react fur- ther, probably for steric reasons."
          [10] "During the metathesis reaction, infrared spectroscopy showed that the tantalum hy- dride disappeared and was transformed into a tantalum-alkvl intermediate."
          [11] "In the case of ethane, this step of C-C bond formation and cleavage enables the liberation of pro- pane and the formation of a tantalum- methyl surface complex."
          [12] "The last step in the catalytic cycle must liberate methane and regenerate the active species, the tan- talum-ethyl surface complex; a new four- centered transition state is assumed in which a hydrogen is transferred from an ethane molecule to the methyl ligand (Scheme 1)."
          [13] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first steo. a C-H bond of acvclic alkane (for ex- & , example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond met- athesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum- alkyl (for example, ethyl) species; this ele- mentary step is indeed observed during the C-H bond activation of cycloalkanes on the [Ta],-H species, yielding the corresponding tantalum-cycloalkyl surface complexes (Eq. I), and occurs without modification of the oxidation state of the metal (4)."
          [14] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the for- mation of C-C bonds."
          [15] "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two spe- cies, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-iso- propyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."
          [16] "The subsequent transfer of a methyl group from a second propane molecule to these propyl intermediates enables the evolution of n- butane and isobutane as well as the forma- tion of a tantalum-ethyl complex, which in turn will yield ethane."
          [17] "The metathesis of isobutane is particu- larly interesting with respect to the product distribution. In agreement with the pro- posed mechanism, the C-H bond activa- tion step can produce two tantalum-alkyl intermediates (Scheme 4)."
          [18] "We can expect that the formation of the tantalum-tert- butyl species can be disfavored (relative to that of the other possible tantalum-isobutyl complex) for steric reasons; despite this, the production of neopentane resulting from the methyl transfer step on the tantalum- tert-butyl occurs in substantial amounts."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes at low temperatures has gained interest over the past few years because more efficient routes to chemicals are necessary to optimize oil resources."
          [2] "Within this context, we reported in 1997, the reaction of alkane metathesis, which catalytically transforms a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues using a silica-supported tantalum hydride prepared by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
          [3] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates."
          [4] "Although introducing ligands that play a key role in controlling the reactivity and the selectivity of catalysts has been a long-term goal, all ancillary ligands introduced so far (alkylidyne, pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*), Cl) have been detrimental to catalyst performances."
          [5] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation); that is, by the relative position of the substituents: typically substituents in the [1,3]-positions of the metalla-cyclobutane intermediate generate less steric hindrance than in the [1,2]-positions."
          [6] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."
          [7] "When propane (540 equiv) is brought into contact with 1a at 150C in a batch reactor, it is converted into mainly ethane (56.1%), butane (35.3%), and small quantities of methane (0.1%), isobutane (2.7%), and pentanes (5.9%)."
          [8] "The turnover frequency is constant for 40 h (ca. 1 TONh1; TON=turnover number), and then there is a reproducible decrease of conversion."
          [9] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

          [2] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
          [3] "The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
          [4] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
          [5] "In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
          [6] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."
          [7] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones."
          [8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
          [9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."
          [10] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

[1] "Hydrogenolysis of cyclic alkanes is catalysed by [(SiO)2TaH] (1) at 160C and leads to lower alkanes and cyclic alkanes including cyclopentane."
          [2] "The mechanism of ring contraction probably involves carbene de-insertion as a key carboncarbon bond-cleavage step."
          [3] "The reluctance of cyclopentane to undergo hydrogenolysis was further studied: under the reaction conditions cyclopentane reacts with 1 to give the corresponding cyclopentyl derivative [(SiO)2TaC5H9] (13), which evolves towards cyclopentadienyl derivative [(SiO)2Ta(C5H5)] (14) according to both solid-state NMR and EXAFS spectroscopies."
          [4] "This latter complex is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, and therefore the formation of cyclopentane in the hydrogenolysis of various cyclic alkanes is probably responsible for the de-activation of the catalyst by formation of cyclopentadienyl complexes."
          [5] "In the case of 1, a similar trend in ring size dependence was also observed (vide supra), yet cyclohexane undergoes hydrogenolysis, which is not observed with Group 4 metal hydrides."
          [6] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
          [7] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."
          [8] "Secondly, the intermediate 4 could also directly undergo intramolecular activation of a carboncarbon bond in the α or in the β position (Scheme 4, Pathways 4 and 5)."
          [9] "Pathway 5 corresponds to an α-alkyl transfer,14, 15 which gives an intermediate 11 that can readily transform into either intermediate 3 upon hydrogen addition or 12 via successive β-H and α-H transfer steps."
          [10] "While the former pathway (via 3) could potentially account for the two-carbon ring-contraction product (cyclopentane) or smaller linear products (pentane) via a β-alkyl transfer (Scheme 4: 313),22 it cannot readily explain the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products."
          [11] "On the other hand, the conversion of 11 to 6 and/or 12 by simple hydrogen-transfer processes does allow the formation of all the products to be explained."
          [12] "Carboncarbon activation in the β position in intermediate 4 (Pathway 4) can be regarded as a β-alkyl transfer,23 depending on whether one considers that the oxidation state of the metal centre has changed or not (metallacyclopropane versus π-olefin complex)."
          [13] "This pathway gives ω-alkenyl complexes like 12, which can readily undergo insertion to give 9, either directly or via 6, and hence leads to the formation of smaller ring systems (cyclohexane or methylcyclopentane)."
          [14] "Note that most intermediates (5, 11 and 12) can readily fall into one or another carboncarbon activation manifold, since α- and β-H transfer processes are very common for Group 5 transition metals.19"
          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."



• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346].

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."

          [15] "In the case of the hydrogenolysis of Group 4 metal hydrides, the ring contraction was best explained by a β-alkyl transfer mechanismlike for acyclic alkanesand was very dependent on the alkane ring size (cycloheptane>cyclohexane (no reaction)).9b"
          [16] "This, along with the formation of one-carbon ring-contraction products, speaks for a mechanistic difference between Group 4 metal hydrides and 1."
          [17] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."
