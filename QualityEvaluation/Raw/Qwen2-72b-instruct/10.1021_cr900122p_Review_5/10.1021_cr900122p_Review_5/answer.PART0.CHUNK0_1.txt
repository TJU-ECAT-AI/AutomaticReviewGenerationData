[1] "Scheme 27c. Proposed Two-Site Mechanism for the Catalytic Metathesis of Alkanes (Only One of the Two Possible Metallacyclobutanes Is Represented);"
[2] "After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[3] "The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species."
[4] "Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
[5] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process,"
[6] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."
[7] "In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center,"
[8] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."
[9] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
[10] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."
[11] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26)."
[12] "This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

1.The two-site mechanism for the catalytic metathesis of alkanes involves the formation of H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species after the initial CH bond activation. One site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps then liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues. The selectivity in higher homologues is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process.
2.The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, formed in situ from silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center.
3.Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate.
4.Cyclic alkanes, except cyclopentane, undergo hydrogenolysis with the catalyst, yielding lower cyclic homologues. The key step involves the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, followed by a γ-H activation, leading to a metallacyclobutane intermediate. This intermediate can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

1.烷烃催化裂合的双位点机制涉及在初始CH键活化后形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物，而另一个位点通过α-H转移向Ta-烷基亚甲基发展。烯烃在第二位点进行同系化过程，导致不同的烯烃和烷基亚甲基物种。随后的氢化和氢解步骤释放较低和较高的烷烃同系物。较高的同系物的选择性与烯烃裂合是关键的同系化过程一致。
2.单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基亚甲基中间体，这些中间体原位从硅胶支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基亚甲基钽表面复合物形成。烯烃中间体的形成和转化在金属中心的配位范围内进行。
3.两种机制都基于烯烃裂合和烷基亚甲基氢化物作为关键中间体。
4.除了环戊烷外，各种环烷烃在催化剂的作用下发生氢解，产生较低的环同系物。关键步骤涉及通过CH键活化形成环烷基衍生物，随后是γ-H活化，产生金属环丁烷中间体。该中间体可以经历环逆转和后续步骤，产生较低的环和非环烷烃同系物。
