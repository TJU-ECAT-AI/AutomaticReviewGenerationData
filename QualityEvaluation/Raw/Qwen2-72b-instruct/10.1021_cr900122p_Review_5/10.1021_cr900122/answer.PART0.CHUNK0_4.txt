[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. (304) The alkene, generated by the first site, then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, which leads to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps provide a way to liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues."
[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). (251, 252) In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center, as shown previously for the formation of cross-metathesis products, resulting from the reaction of an alkane and a neopentyl neopentylidene surface complex (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = CH2R)."
[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process, (252, 298, 299) in contrast to the catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, where a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues are generated, as a result of the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates and, in particular, internal ones. (298, 305-309)"
[4] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."
[5] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."

1.The two-site mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After the initial CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes a homologation process on the second site, leading to a different alkene and alkylidene species. Subsequent hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps liberate the lower and higher alkane homologues.
2.The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. The formation and conversion of alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center.
3.The selectivity in higher homologues, mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process and 1-alkenes participating in the homologation process. This contrasts with catalytic alkane metathesis processes based on mixtures of alkene metathesis and dehydrogenation/hydrogenation catalysts, which generate a broad distribution of lower and higher homologues due to the cross-metathesis of a broad range of alkene intermediates, particularly internal ones.
4.In the case of cyclic alkanes, the key step involves γ-H activation after the formation of cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation. This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, such as hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.
5.Catalysts developed for alkane metathesis include tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports, such as silica-alumina, alumina, and tailored-made supports. These catalysts display similar activities and selectivities to the original silica-supported tantalum hydrides.

1.由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的双位点机制涉及钽氢化物作为关键中间体。在最初的CH键活化形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，从而再生钽氢化物；另一个位点通过α-H转移向Ta-烷基亚甲基发展。然后，由第一个位点生成的烯烃在第二个位点上进行同系化过程，导致不同的烯烃和烷基亚甲基物种。随后的氢化和氢解步骤释放较低和较高的烷烃同系物。
2.单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基亚甲基中间体，它们原位形成于二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基亚甲基钽表面复合物。烯烃中间体的形成和转化在金属中心的配位球内进行。
3.较高同系物的选择性，即主要为n  1和n + 1的线性同系物，与烯烃同系化是关键同系化过程的事实完全一致，1-烯烃主要参与同系化过程。这与基于烯烃同系化和脱氢/氢化催化剂混合物的催化烷基化过程形成鲜明对比，后者由于广泛的烯烃中间体的交叉同系化，特别是内部烯烃，产生较宽分布的较低和较高同系物。
4.在环烷的情况下，关键步骤可能涉及在通过CH键活化形成环烷基衍生物后，γ-H活化。这产生一个金属环丁烷中间体，可以经历环反转和后续步骤，例如氢解、氢化和重排，以产生较低的环状和非环状烷烃同系物。
5.为烷基化开发的催化剂包括在各种氧化物支撑上制备的钽氢化物，例如硅铝酸盐、氧化铝和定制支撑。这些催化剂显示出与原始二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物相似的活性和选择性。
