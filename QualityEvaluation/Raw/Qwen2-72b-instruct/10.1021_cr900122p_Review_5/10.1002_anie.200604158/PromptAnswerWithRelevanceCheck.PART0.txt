Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. It does mention that silica-supported tantalum hydrides catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues through a reaction named alkane metathesis. This process involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes.

1.文献没有提供硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的全面机制。它确实提到硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基转化为其直接较低和较高的同系物，通过一个名为烷基化反应的过程。这个过程涉及碳烯和金属环丁烷中间体，这解释了从起始烷基通过一次转移一个碳原子，选择性地形成直接较低和较高的线性同系物，从而防止长链烷基的形成。
