1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it discusses the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps proposed for this reaction include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The mechanism is based on the formation and role of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1.文献没有提供关于硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的全面机制。但是，它讨论了使用单点方法和在硅胶上支持的高亲电性钽氢化物将低级烷烃转化为更高级的同系物。反应主要涉及从一个链向另一个链转移一个碳，通过CH和CC键的断裂和形成。对于这个反应，提出的几个关键步骤包括通过CH键活化进行的石蜡脱氢，形成金属-烷基，随后形成烯烃和金属-氢化物；在金属-烷基上通过α-H消除形成的金属-卡宾上进行烯烃化；以及在金属-氢化物上对新形成的烯烃进行氢化。形成Cn+1产物的选择性高于Cn+2产物。对丙烷化反应的动能研究揭示了反应的主要产物，即烯烃和H2。机制基于关键中间体的形成和作用，如烯烃和金属环丁烷，这些中间体对各种烷烃转化的反应选择性和催化剂性能有贡献。
