2-Methylpropane and 2-methylpropene, in the presence of the W(H)3/Al2O3 catalyst, are unexpectedly transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutenes, respectively, with high selectivity; in case of 2-methylpropane, this reaction represents the first example of the transfer of two carbons in alkane metathesis.
The transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues remains a great challenge in chemistry, in particular for branched alkanes in view of fuel needs.13 Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a,could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues.2 This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds (Scheme 1).
Typically propane gives mainly ethane (4550%) and butanes (3035%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes. Ethylbenzene and methane can also be obtained by cross-metathesis between toluene and ethane.4 In all experiments carried out so far, the selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product proved to be higher than that of the Cn+2 one, in agreement with the previously proposed mechanism.5 In fact, kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor,revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride.5 Recently, we have developed a W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst,1b, giving higher turnover numbers (TON) and having a much greater stability than Ta hydrides.69 The peculiarity of both systems lies in the fact that Ta or W hydrides are multifunctionalsingle site catalysts (alkane dehydrogenation,olefin metathesis and olefin hydrogenation). Herein, we report that 2-methylpropane, in the presence of the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, is unexpectedly transformed to 2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) with a high selectivity.10 This metathesis reaction of an iso-Cn paraffin leading to an iso-Cn+2 product instead of an iso-Cn+1, involves formally the selective transfer of two carbons, which is unexpected in view of the classical mechanism previously proposed for this reaction (see ESI Scheme S1w).5 Interestingly, 2,3-DMB exhibits the highest octane number (RON = 104) among the hexane isomers.11 Similarly, the W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, also unexpectedly transforms 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutenes (2,3-DMB=) with a good selectivity which is the first case of productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene12,13 and again fits with the role of 2-methylpropene as a primary product for the metathesis of 2-methylpropane.
Typically, when 2-methylpropane was passed over the alumina-supported tungsten hydride, W(H)3/Al2O3500, 1b,(Pi-C4H10 = 1 bar, T = 150 1C, flow rate 4 mL min1 or volume hourly space velocity (VHSV) 260 h1) its conversion reached a maximum at 8% and approximately 37 TON were achieved over 43 h (Fig. 1(a)). At the pseudo-steady state, the observed selectivities in 2-methylpropane metathesis are 2,3-DMB (41.7%), ethane (41.3%), 2-methylbutane (5.3%),propane (5.2%), methane (1.5%), heptanes (1.0%) and 2-methylpropene (3.1%) (Fig. 1(b)). The higher homo- logues can be ordered as follows: Cn+2 c Cn+1 4 Cn+3.
These results are quite different from those obtained with W(H)3/Al2O3500 in metathesis of linear alkanes, where the selectivities always follow the order: Cn+1 4 Cn+2 c Cn+3.68 Interestingly the ratio of selectivities of 2,3-DMB/ethane and 2-methylbutane/propane are close to unity. 2-Methylpropene was observed (up to 3.1%) among the products of 2-methylpropane metathesis and therefore, its metathesis was also checked over 1b in a continuous flow reactor (Pi-C4H8 = 1 bar, T = 150 1C, flow rate 4 mL min1 or volume hourly space velocity (VHSV) 260 h1) (Fig. 2).

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue of 0.22 moli-C4H8 molW 1 min1, with an overall turnover number (TON) of 235 after 16 h (Fig. 2(a)). At the pseudo- steady state, the product selectivities were 2,3-dimethylbutenes 50%, ethylene 30%; 2,4,4-trimethylpentenes 12%, neohexene 9%, isopentene 3% and propene 1% (Fig. 2(b)). 2,4,4-Trimethyl-1-pentene and 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene are likely formed by dimerisation of 2-methylpropene on the acidic sites of alumina dehydroxylated at 500 1C13,14 while the presence of neohexene can be explained by a cross-metathesis between 2,4,4-trimethylpentenes and ethylene.
In summary, whereas the metathesis of 2-methylpropene is usually known as a degenerate process with the classical olefin metathesis catalysts,12,13 W(H)3/Al2O3500 also proves to be the first compound capable of catalyzing the productive self-metathesis of 2-methylpropene into 2,3-dimethylbutene.
Interestingly,2,3-dimethylbutene has the same carbon skeleton as the major product formed during the metathesis of 2-methylpropane i.e. 2,3-DMB. These observations confirm that 2-methylpropene is a primary product which leads to a specific mechanistic pathway for 2-methylpropane metathesis as explicated hereafter.

double bond insertion in 1b are expected to lead to the same tris(isobutyl)tungsten intermediate 2 (Scheme 2); in the first case hydrogen is also evolved which is likely consumed via hydrogenolysis of 2-methylpropane leading to the sharp initial peaks of methane and propane (Fig. 1(b)), as 1b is known to catalyze such a reaction.68 The trisisobutyl tungsten complex 2, [W(CH2CH(CH3)2)3]/ Al2O3500, resulting from the initiation steps, can undergo an a-H transfer to form 3,

Depending on the two coordinative approaches of 2-methylpropene, two possible tungstacyclobutanes 5a and 5b,are obtained, which have gem-methyl and -isopropyl substituents in either the [1,2] or [1,3]-positions (Scheme 4a and c). These two tungstacycles will further undergo metathetical cleavages:(i) 5a giving 3-methyl-1-butene and the new hydrido- tungsta-carbene 6a, [W(H)(=C(CH3)2)]/Al2O3500, (ii) 5b giving 2,4-dimethyl-2-pentene and the hydrido-tungsta-carbene 6b,

The hydrido-tungsta-carbenes 6a and 6b can also react further with 2-methylpropene giving the corresponding tungstacyclobutanes intermediates 7a and 7b (Scheme 4b).
Again, these two tungstacycles can undergo metathetical cleavage,7a giving 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene and the hydrido-tungsta-carbene 6b, 7b giving ethylene and the hydrido- tungsta-carbene 6a (Scheme 4b).
Paradoxically, 7a is a priori the less thermodynamically favored intermediate, compared to 5b and particularly 5a, since it has gem-methyl substituents in the [1,2]-positions generating a sterically encumbered tungstacyclobutane intermediate.5,16 Two other intermediates 7a0 and 7b0 could be formed from the reverse favored approach of 2-methylpropene on 6a and 6b but they lead to degenerate metathesis (Scheme S2w).
Productive metathesis of 2-methylpropene involving 7a is thus disfavored for steric reasons which accounts for the fact that it was not reported previously12,13 and a moderate activity is observed with W(H)3/Al2O3500 by comparison with metathesis of linear alkenes, such as propylene.17 From the various catalytic cycles (a), (b), (c), the 2-methylpropane metathesis process proceeds with the insertion of all the released olefins into tungsten-hydride species such as 4, 6a or 6b. The resulting tungsten alkyl groups can be further cleaved by

(Scheme S1w), affording the liberation of ethane, 2-methylbutane,2,3-DMB and 2,4-dimethylpentane.5 The alkyl groups could Fig. 2 Metathesis of 2-methylpropene catalyzed by (W(H)3/Al2O3, 1b (3.86 wt% W): (a) conversion of 2-methylpropene ( E) and TON (m);(b) selectivities: (J) ethylene, () propene; (m) 2-methylbutene; (&) neohexene, (K) 2,3-dimethylbutene (2,3-DMB=); ( E) 2,4,4-trimethyl- 1-pentene and 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene.Scheme 3 Scheme 2 Fig. 1 Metathesis of 2-methylpropane catalyzed by (W(H)3/Al2O3,1b (3.86 wt% W): (a) conversion of 2-methylpropane (K) and TON (m); (b) selectivities: ( E) methane, (J) ethane, () propane; (*) 2-methylpropene;(&) 2-methylbutane;

The excess of 2-methylbutane (5%) over 2,4-dimethylpentane (0.5%) can be understood on the basis of the stability of the key metallacyclobutanes or of the facility of their formation (5a 4 5b), which both depends on the interaction between the substituents in the [1,2] or [1,3]-positions as proposed for olefin metathesis.16 Alternatively, although unfavorably, the hydrido-tungsta- carbenes 6a and 6b could undergo the migration of the hydride onto the carbene ligands involving the formation of WIV(CH(CH3)2) 8a and WIV(CH3) 8b but also a concomitant disfavored reduction of WVI to WIV.18 The resulting alkyl groups could again be displaced by H2 or the incoming alkane reactant via s-bond metathesis giving propane and methane in minor amounts (Scheme 4a and 1c). Finally, it should be mentioned here that 2,3-DMB, which is of interest for its high octane number (RON = 104),11 is currently obtained by paraffin isomerisation with the use of two major commercial bifunctional catalysts: Pt on highly chlorinated alumina, and Pt on mordenite; however, the selectivity remains low around 8% and both catalysts are deactivated by coke formation.19 In conclusion, tungsten hydride supported on alumina W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyzes both 2-methylpropene and 2-methylpropane metathesis with a common core mechanistic scheme affording the main formation of 2,3-DMB= and 2,3-DMB. A new mechanistic pathway is proposed based on two key hydrido-tungsta-carbenes 4 and 6a which accounts for the formation and the selectivities of all the products observed.
