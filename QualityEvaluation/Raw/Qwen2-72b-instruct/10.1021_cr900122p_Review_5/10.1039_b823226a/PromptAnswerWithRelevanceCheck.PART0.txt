Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. However, it does discuss the transformation of lower alkanes into higher homologues using a single site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. The reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds. The key steps proposed include paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride, olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl, and hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride. The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. The role of 2-methylpropene as a primary product for the metathesis of 2-methylpropane is also discussed. The mechanism proposed for the metathesis of 2-methylpropane and 2-methylpropene involves the formation of key intermediates such as tris(isobutyl)tungsten, carbene-hydride, tungstacyclobutanes, and hydrido-tungsta-carbenes, which contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1.文献没有提供关于硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的全面机制。但是，它确实讨论了使用单点方法和高电荷性的硅胶支持的钽氢化物将低级烷烃转化为更高级的同系物。反应主要涉及从一个链向另一个链转移一个碳，通过CH和CC键的断裂和形成。提出的反应关键步骤包括通过CH键活化进行的石蜡脱氢，形成金属烷基，随后形成烯烃和金属氢化物；在通过a-H消除从金属烷基形成的金属卡宾上进行的烯烃环化；以及在金属氢化物上对新烯烃进行氢化。形成Cn+1产物的选择性高于Cn+2产物。对丙烷环化反应的动能研究揭示了反应的主要产物，即烯烃和H2。2-甲基丙烯作为2-甲基丙烷环化反应的初级产物的作用也被讨论。对于2-甲基丙烷和2-甲基丙烯的环化反应提出的机制涉及形成关键中间体，如三异丁基钨、卡宾氢化物、钨环丁烷和氢化钨卡宾，这些中间体对各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能有贡献。

The selectivity for the formation of the Cn+1 product is higher than that of the Cn+2 one. Kinetic studies on propane metathesis revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2.

The literature also reports the unexpected transformation of 2-methylpropane to 2,3-dimethylbutane and 2-methylpropene to 2,3-dimethylbutene catalyzed by an alumina-supported tungsten hydride, which involves the selective transfer of two carbons, a process not previously observed in alkane metathesis.
