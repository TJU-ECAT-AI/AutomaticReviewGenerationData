Inorg. Phys. Theor. 1565 Exchange Reactions of Benzene, Toluene, and m-Xylene with Deuterium on Silica-Alumina and Alumina Catalysts By I?.
McCosh and C.Kemball,"t The Queen's University, Belfast The exchange reactions of benzene, toluene, and rn-xylene with deuterium have been studied on two silica-alumina catalysts containing 13% (I) or 45% (11) alumina and on pure alumina. The temperature ranges studied were 125-440". 20-1 00". and 20-250" for the three catalysts respectively. On any catalyst the hydrogen atoms in the ring positions of all three hydrocarbons reacted at the same rate and there were no appreciable directing effects due to the side-groups. Rates of reaction were substantially lower on silica-alumina I than on the other catalysts. Side-group exchange with toluene or rn-xylene was slower than ring exchange by factors ranging from 30 upwards. Subsidiary experiments on hydrogen-deuterium exchange and on the isomerization of rn-xylene were also carried out. Silica-alumina I was the least active for hydrogen-deuterium exchange and isomerized rn-xylene at rates comparable with those found for side-group exchange.
CATALYTIC exchange reactions of alkylbenzenes with deuterium have been studied on metal film,l- supported platinum,* chromium oxide titania,6 and nickel- exchanged zeolites.' These reactions provide a useful method of investigating catalysts because of the different types of carbon-hydrogen bond present in the alkyl- benzenes and the results already reported show striking variation in the relative ability of the various catalysts to bring about the exchange of side-group and ring hydrogen atoms. The purpose of the present work was to investigate the activity o f silica-alumina and alumina catalysts for the exchange of the hydrogen atoms in benzene, toluene, and m-xylene. We wanted to find out to what extent the behaviour of these oxides differed from the other classes of catalyst studied. A further t Present address: Department of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh.

reason for choosing silica-alumina was to determine whether the effects which have been shown to apply in the homogeneous acid-catalysed exchange reactions of alkylbenzenes 8 were also noticeable on a typical hetero- geneous catalyst of the acidic type.
EXPERIMENTAL
Apfiaratus.-The main features have been described.9 The apparatus consisted of a gas handling system with a silica reaction vessel (volume 190  m .  ) linked by a fine capillary leak to a Metropolitan Vickers MS2 mass spec- trometer. In this way frequent analyses of the gas from the reaction vessel could be made during each experiment.
Materials .-AnalaR samples of benzene and toluene were dried over Linde 5A molecular sieve and distilled under vacuum. m-Xylene was obtained as a 99.91% sample from the Chemical Standards Division of the N.P.L. ,4 1 1

hydrocarbons were degassed before use by repeated cycles of freezing, pumping, and thawing. Deuterium (99.5%) was obtained from the Matheson Company and purified by diffusion through a palladium thimble followed by a liquid-nitrogen trap. Cylinder oxygen was dried by passage through a liquid-nitrogen trap.

the Agricultural Division of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and the alumina sample (97% gibbsite, 3% bayerite) was obtained from Peter Spence and Sons, Ltd.* Technique.-The procedure for activating the catalysts involved heating in oxygen (100 torr) for 3 hr. at 520",followed by evacuation and a second oxygen treatment.
Finally the catalyst was outgassed for 12 hr. at 520" at 10-6 torr. The whole procedure was repeated before each run. After cooling, a gas mixture of 2 torr of hydrocarbon and 40 torr of deuterium was admitted to the reaction vessel and the exchange reaction was followed at two or more temperatures.
Mass-spectrometric analyses were carried out with an ionizing beam of 13v electrons for benzene and toluene and 17v electrons for m-xylene. The usual corrections were made to the observed peak heights of the ions to allow for naturally occurring heavy carbon and deuterium and for the fragmentation of the molecules.
The methods for determining the rate of exchange of the various types of hydrogen atom in the molecules have been described but the equations used will be summarized briefly. For a molecule in which all hydrogen atoms are replaced at the same rate the course of the exchange is given by equation (1) where kd is the initial rate of entry of deuter- ium atoms into 100 molecules of hydrocarbon and # = log,, ( 4 0 0 - +) = --K,t/(2.3034,) + log10 #a,(1) Xi di, di being the percentage of isotopic species containing i deuterium atoms at time t, & ,is the equilibrium value of 4.
The initial rate of disappearance of the light hydro- carbon k, can be obtained from equation (2). The ratio l
O
g 1 o d o = -k,t/230.3 + lOgO(100) (2) K&/k,gives the average number of deuterium atoms entering each molecule in the initial stages of the reaction. For molecules containing two groups of hydrogen atoms which react at different rates the plot according to equation (1) will not be linear although the initial and final portions will approximate to straight lines with different slopes. Under these circumstances modified equations similar in form to equation (1) have to be used to determine the rates of reaction.
RESULTS
Character o f the Exchange Reactions.-The value of kdlk,,was unity for each system showing that stepwise exchange with the replacement of a single hydrogen atom at a time was occurring with each hydrocarbon over the three catalysts. On each catalyst, the ring hydrogen atoms in toluene and m-xylene were exchanged more rapidly than the hydrogen atoms in the methyl groups. Evidence for this is given in Figure 1 which shows a curved plot for m-xylene according to equation (1) and linear plots on modified equations assuming that 4 atoms were replaced quickly and 6 more slowly.
Further evidence to confirm that the ring hydrogen atoms were replaced preferentially and that all ring positions were exchanging at similar rates was obtained from the dis- tributions of products at various stages of the reactions.
Some typical distributions for toluene are shown in Table 2 which illustrate the way in which products with up to Time (min.)

Comparisons may also be made with calculated distributions of products which are readily obtainable for the case of stepwise exchange.1 Under these circumstances, the percentage of the various isotopic hydrocarbons for a molecule in which all the hydrogen atoms are equally reactive can be derived at any stage of the reaction from the terms of the binomial expansion (3), where n is the number of exchangeable (3) hydrogen atoms and #t is the value of # at time t.
For molecules with two groups of hydrogen atoms, a more complicated procedure must be used in which a binomial distribution is evaluated for each group by use of the appropriate value o f

Random distribution assuming 4 equally exchange- able hydrogen atoms. distribution derived from equation (3) on the assumption that all eight atoms were equally reactive and as shown it differs markedly from the experimental distributions. On the other hand distribution B, based on two groups of atoms, is in excellent agreement with the result on silica- alumina I1 and equally good agreement was obtained with the experimental results on the other catalysts in a similar manner. Results for m-xylene are given in Table 3 and they confirm the evidence from the kinetic plots of Figure 1.
The distributions in Table 4 were obtained at earlier stages of reaction where side-group exchange was negligible.
For each catalyst the experimental distributions corre- sponded closely to random distributions calculated on the assumption that only ring hydrogen atoms were replaced.
This agreement shows that all the ring hydrogen atoms in each molecule are equally reactive in exchange.
Rates.-In order to compare the rates of exchange of the hydrocarbons a series of four runs was carried out using the same catalyst sample. Each series involved the exchange of benzene, toluene, m-xylene and finally benzene again with reactivation of the catalyst between each run. The results in Figure 2 for y-alumina show the maximum decrease in activity between the initial and final runs with benzene observed with any sample.

A second series on a fresh sample of y-alumina show-ed a maximum spread by a factor of 1-6 between any two runs with all the rates falling between those for the initial and final runs for benzene shown in Figure 2. These results showed that within the limits of reproducibility the ring hydrogen atoms in all three hydrocarbons were exchanging at the same rate on any one catalyst.
Because of the variation in catalytic activity from one run to the next we believed that it was preferable to derive Arrhenius parameters from rates obtained at two or three temperatures during the same run. In this way activation energies for ring exchange could be obtained with reason- able accuracy as is demonstrated by the parallel Arrhenius Catalyst Silica-alumina I b ...

Measure- ments on the exchange of the side-groups were less accurate because there was a tendency for the catalyts to become poisoned at the higher temperatures used. This poisoning was most noticeable on silica-alumina I1 and consequently reliable activation energies for side-group exchange could not be obtained. The rates and the Arrhenius parameters are summarized in Table 5. No loss of hydrocarbon from the gas phase was detected even when poisoning was occurring.
Specially treated y-A 1umina.-The exchange of toluene was followed on y-alumina which had been subjected to two different pre-treatments : (a) after normal pre-treat- ment, exposure to oxygen (100 torr) for 30 min. at 520",cooling to 20, and evacuating for 1 hr., (b) after normal pre-treatment, exposure to deuterium (45 torr) for 1 hr. at 620, and after evacuation for 10 min., exposure to a further

Typical retention times for $-, w z -  and o-xylene were 24-5,28, and 30.5 min. respectively.
Results are in Table 6.
No isomerization occurred on y-alumina or on silica- alumina I1 at temperatures which gave rapid ring exchange.
On silica-alumina I isomerization of m-xylene was about 1/30th of the rate of ring exchange at 400" but the rates were similar to those for side-group exchange. Also the activation energy for isomerization was about 13 kcal./mole which is close to the value for the slower exchange process.
Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange.-Reactions were carried out with equal pressures (13 torr) of hydrogen and deuterium. Rapid exchange occurred at -93" on both silica-alumina I1 and y-alumina, the latter showing a slow reaction [O-O5%/(min. 0.1 g.) j even at liquid-nitrogen temperature.In contrast, higher temperatures were Published on 01 January 1968.

Variation in Activity .-The variations in activity are probably associated with minor differences in the pre- treatment of the catalysts which may include some variation in the amount of water retained on the surface.
Hindin and Weller l1 have shown that both activation temperature and water content influence the activity of y-alumina for the exchange of hydrogen and deuterium and for the hydrogenation of ethylene. Small traces of poisons may also contribute to the variation in activity.
Larson and Hall12 have shown that carbon dioxide poisons the exchange of methane and deuterium on y- alumina.
Comparison with Homogeneous Acid Catalysis.-The common feature between our results and those for the homogeneous acid-catalysed exchange of the alkyl- benzenes8 is that the ring hydrogen atoms react in preference to side-group atoms. However there are a number of differences between the two systems. On these oxide catalysts the side groups in toluene and m-xylene neither enhance the rate of exchange of the ring atoms nor cause directing effects favouring reaction at the ortho or para positions. Further, side-group exchange does occur, although slowly, on these oxides but it is found only in exceptional cases in homo- geneous acid catalysis, eg., with aromatic molecules containing the t-butyl side group.13 The absence of any appreciable isomerization of m-xylene at the temperatures used for ring exchange is important in relation to the equal reactivity of all four ring positions.
If isomerization had been rapid compared with exchange,it would not have been possible to detect differences in the rate of reaction for the various ring positions.
Comparison with Metals or Other Oxides.-The ex- change behaviour of the alkylbenzenes over silica- alumina and alumina is strikingly different from the results found with metals and some other oxide cata- lysts. With metals the side-group hydrogen atoms tend to exchange as fast as, if not faster than, ring atoms and there is usually some evidence of multiple exchange. On rutile all the hydrogen atoms in toluene exchange at similar rates whereas chromium oxide gel 5 gives results similar to alumina, exchanging the ring atoms about ten times faster than those in the methyl group at 110". All three oxides give predominantly stepwise exchange. The exchange of m-xylene with deuterium has now been studied on a number o f catalyts and the results in Table 7 show the large range found for the ratio of ring to side group exchange.

(b) The rate of exchange of CD, with hydrogen l2 is close to the common rate that we find for the exchange of the ring hydrogen atoms in the three aromatic molecules. The rate o f the methane reaction at 20" is 5.4 x lo9 molecule/sec. cm.2 compared with 3-7 x lo9 in the same units for benzene exchange. The activation energy for both reactions are also similar (5.7 and 6.0 kcal./mole for methane and benzene respectively).
(c) The surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst exchange with deuterium much more slowly than the rate of the hydrogen-deuterium re- action. Temperatures of 50-100" or even higher are needed to bring about the replacement of the hydrogen associated with the surfae.J5J An approximate activ- ation energy of 6 kcal./mole has been derived for the process l5 but evidence based on spectroscopic studies showed that there is a range o f rates for the replacement o f different types of hydroxyl groups.16 (d) When CD,is used as the source of deuterium atoms only a fraction of the surface hydroxyl groups exchange rapidly at 135" which is a much higher temperature than that required for the exchange of methane with deuterium or for the equilibration of CH, and CD,.12 The sites which exchange readily at 135" number 7 x 1012/cm.2.
Larson and Hall12 suggested that the cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond in methane was the slow step in the exchange reactions of methane.

chance that both methane and the alkylaxomatic com- pounds exchange with deuterium at much the same rate. We believe that another possibility might be considered. The exchange of a hydrocarbon may only take place readily with deuterium atoms which are present in the form of OD groups at special sites and the rate-determining step might be the conversion of OH into OD at these sites. This suggestion would explain the equality between the rates of exchange of the ring atoms in the three aromatic molecules and the atoms in methane, the absence of directing effects due to the side groups in the aromatic molecules, the absence of any multiple exchange, and the fact that the activation energies of the exchange reactions are close to the approximate value for the replacement of surface hydroxyl by deuterium.15 However for this hypothesis to be tenable it is necessary to assume that a relatively small number of these special sites exist in order to account for the absence of an initial burst of reaction with toluene exchange on a catalyst pre-treated with deuterium at 520. On the other hand, an assumption of less than 3 x 1012 sites/cm.2 would be difficult to reconcile with the data from the poisoning experiments carried out by Larson and Hall2 Alternatively the absence of directing effects in the exchange of toluene and m-xylene could be explained if the reaction proceeded by a mechanism whereby the aromatic ring is bound to the surface by donation of x electrons to electron acceptor centres before exchange with deuter- ium, This sort of mechanism may not show preference for exchange in the ortho and para ring positions. The effect o f the field gradients near the catalyst surface could also play an important role in the nature of the exchange reaction.
The slow step in the exchange of the side groups must be associated with the activation of the hydrocarbon and the exchange is likely to occur by a dissociative mechan- ism possibly involving a heterolytic cleavage of a carbon- hydrogen bond. Results with a wider range of alkyl- benzenes including ethylbenzene and cumene would be useful in determining the mechanism of these reactions.
SiZica-AZzGmina 1.-The most noteworthy point is that this catalyst is much less active than 7-alumina for the exchange reactions of hydrogen and of the alkyl- benzenes with deuterium. In this respect our results are in accord with others for silica-aluminas containing l0-13% alumina which show poor activity for exchange reactions of methane 12 and low rates of replacement of surface hydrogen by deuterium.15 Thus it appears that 17 R.

1951, 73, 278; 1955, 77, 538. the strongly acidic sites present on such silica-aluminas are not essential for the exchange processes we have investigated. With silica-alumina I the exchange of hydrogen with deuterium is only slightly more rapid than the reaction of the ring atoms of the alkylbenzenes but the latter exchange much nore rapidly than methane in contrast to the results with y-alumina.
Much of the previous work on exchange 17-21 reactions using silica-alumina has involved pre-treating the catalyst with (or adding) D20 and so the results cannot be compared directly with our measurements. The use of such pre-treated catalysts gives substantial amounts of multiple exchange and there is usually a maximum in the curve relating rate to content of deuterium oxide which acts as a poison if present in appreciable quantity.
The order o f activity of different molecules is olefins > saturated hydrocarbon containing tertiary carbon atoms ,
benzene > hydrogen > saturated hydro- carbons without tertiary carbon atoms.lg These results indicate that the ease with which the hydrocarbon can forni carbonium ions is an important factor in exchange and also that there is a type of surface deuterium readily formed from D20 which reacts more rapidly with some hydrocarbons, including benzene, than with hydrogen.
The latter point supports the idea that a rate-determining step in our experiments on silica-alumina I, as on y- alumina, might be the conversion of OH into OD at suitable sites.
It is noteworthy that side-group exchange and the isomerization of m-xylene have comparable rates and activation energies and hence possibly a common mechanism operates.
SiZica-AZ.umina II.-This catalyst behaved more like y-alumina than like silica-alumina I in every respect and it is probable that a separate alumina phase is present.
The activation energies for the exchange of the ring atoms are similar on both silica-alumina I1 and y- alumina and the higher activity of the former may be associated with a greater number of catalytic sites.

Various forms of alumina23y24 can result from the dehydration of gibbsite depending on the size of the crystals, and it is possible that the conditions used in the present work lead to x- and not to y-alumina.
