[1] "• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

1.Silica-supported tantalum hydrides catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting an alkane into its lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism, with metallacarbene and alkene intermediates playing key roles. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by these intermediates and the specific reaction conditions.

1.在150摄氏度下，硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷烃互换，将烷烃转化为其较低和较高同系物。例如，丙烷被转化为主要为乙烷和丁烷的混合物。这个反应涉及碳-碳键的形成和断裂，实际上是通过一个pi-键互换来实现的，其中金属卡宾和烯烃中间体起着关键作用。这些中间体和特定的反应条件影响了催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能。
