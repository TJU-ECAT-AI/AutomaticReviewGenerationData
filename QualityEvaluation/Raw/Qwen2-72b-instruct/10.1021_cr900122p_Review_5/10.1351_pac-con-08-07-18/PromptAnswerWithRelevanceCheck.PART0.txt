Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

<quotes>

[1] "• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1.Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

1.在150摄氏度下，硅胶支持的钽氢化物([TaH])催化烷烃的互换反应，将烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。例如，丙烷被转化为主要是乙烷和丁烷的混合物。这个反应涉及金属卡宾和烯烃中间体的形成和作用，关键步骤实际上是通过pi键互换机制的碳-碳键的断裂和形成。这有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能。
