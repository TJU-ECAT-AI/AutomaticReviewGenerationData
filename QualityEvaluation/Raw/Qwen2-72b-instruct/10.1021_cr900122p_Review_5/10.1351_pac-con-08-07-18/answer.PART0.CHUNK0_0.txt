[1] "• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

1.Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of ethane and butane. This reaction involves the formation and role of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism. This contributes to the selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

1.在150摄氏度下，硅胶支持的钽氢化物([TaH])催化烷烃的互换反应，将烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。例如，丙烷被转化为主要是乙烷和丁烷的混合物。这个反应涉及金属卡宾和烯烃中间体的形成和作用，关键步骤实际上是通过pi键互换机制的碳-碳键的断裂和形成。这有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能。
