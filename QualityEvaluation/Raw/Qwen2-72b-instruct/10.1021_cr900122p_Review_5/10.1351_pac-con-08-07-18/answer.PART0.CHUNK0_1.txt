[1] "• Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs,and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This re- action involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleav- age step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

1.Silica-supported tantalum hydrides ([TaH]) catalyze alkane metathesis at 150 degrees Celsius, converting an alkane into its lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is transformed into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates, with the key step being the formation and cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds through a pi-bond metathesis mechanism.

1.在150摄氏度下，硅胶支持的钽氢化物([TaH])催化烷烃的互换反应，将烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。例如，丙烷被转化为主要为乙烷和丁烷的混合物。这个反应涉及金属卡宾和烯烃中间体，关键步骤实际上是通过pi键互换机制形成和断裂碳碳键。
