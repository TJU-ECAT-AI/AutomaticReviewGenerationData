Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. It discusses the preparation and catalytic activity of a new tantalum hydride supported on zirconium hydroxide in the propane metathesis reaction. The mechanism of alkane metathesis, including two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates, and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance, is not detailed in the provided literature.

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive mechanism for alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. It does, however, discuss the preparation and catalytic activity of a new tantalum hydride supported on zirconium hydroxide in the propane metathesis reaction. The improved activity and selectivities compared to the tantalum hydride supported on silica suggest that the coordination sphere of tantalum plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. The presence of zirconium in the support is not the sole cause for higher activity, and the requirement of a tetrahedral Zr imposed by the silica support is likely to be a very important parameter. The support [ZrOH] may favor a low coordination for tantalum hydride, not possible on other supports such as mixed oxides.

1.文献没有提供关于硅胶支持的钽氢化物催化烷基化反应的全面机制。然而，它确实讨论了在丙烷甲基化反应中，一种新型的钽氢化物在锆羟基上的制备和催化活性。与硅胶支持的钽氢化物相比，其改善的活性和选择性表明，钽的配位球体在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。支持物中锆的存在不是活性提高的唯一原因，而硅胶支持物对四面体Zr的要求可能是一个非常重要的参数。[ZrOH]支持物可能有利于钽氢化物的低配位，这是在其他支持物如混合氧化物上不可能实现的。
