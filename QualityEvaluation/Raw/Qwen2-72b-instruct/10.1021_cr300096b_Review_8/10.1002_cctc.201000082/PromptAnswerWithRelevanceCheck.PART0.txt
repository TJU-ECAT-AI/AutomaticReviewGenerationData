How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

1.The literature does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different surfaces, and that the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst.

1.文献没有提供在Pt-3d催化剂上对各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的具体DFT计算，也没有详细说明TPD等技术的实验观察。但是，它确实指出使用DFT计算确定了1,4-CHD在不同表面上的结合能，1,4-CHD在这些表面上的结合能趋势为PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111)，这与实验结果一致，即1,4-CHD在PtNi和PtCo上的较弱结合导致比单金属Pt催化剂更高的氢化速率。

However, it does state that DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different surfaces, and that the optimized configurations for 1,4-CHD and DFT calculation results for different bimetallic surfaces are shown in Figure 3. The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111). The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst.
