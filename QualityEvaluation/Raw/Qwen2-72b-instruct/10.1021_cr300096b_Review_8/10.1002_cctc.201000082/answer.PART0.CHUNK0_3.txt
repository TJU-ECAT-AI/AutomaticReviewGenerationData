1.The literature does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it correlate these calculations with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different surfaces, and that the optimized configurations for 1,4-CHD and DFT calculation results for different bimetallic surfaces are shown in Figure 3. The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111). The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst.

1.文献没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的具体DFT计算，也没有将这些计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联。但是，文献指出使用DFT计算确定了1,4-CHD在不同表面上的结合能，并且在图3中显示了1,4-CHD的优化配置和不同双金属表面的DFT计算结果。次表面结构的表面d带中心值远离费米能级移动，导致1,4-CHD的结合能比Pt(111)上的结合能弱。这些表面上1,4-CHD的结合能遵循PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111)的趋势，这与实验结果一致，即1,4-CHD在PtNi和PtCo上的较弱结合导致比单金属Pt催化剂更高的氢化速率。
