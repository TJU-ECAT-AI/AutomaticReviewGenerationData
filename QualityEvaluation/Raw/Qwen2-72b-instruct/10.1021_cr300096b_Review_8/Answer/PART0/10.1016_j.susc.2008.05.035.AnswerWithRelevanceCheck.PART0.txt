          [1] "DFT calculations were used to examine the adsorption of the three linear alkenes, 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces."
          [2] "The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were then compared against the d-band center of the substrates."
          [3] "Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 b show the binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene, respectively."
          [4] "Overall, the trends in the figures show that the binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) are uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
          [5] "In order to compare DFT calculations with experimental results, Fig. 5 shows the TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces."
          [6] "The activities for each bimetallic surface are listed in Table 2 . Consistent with the strong binding energy of cyclohexene, there is a substantial pathway for decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1)."
          [7] "In contrast, the total activity on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is much lower than either Pt(1 1 1) or NiPtPt(1 1 1), which can be attributed to the weaker binding of cyclohexene on this subsurface structure, as predicted by the DFT calculations."
          [8] "The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined."
          [9] "These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces."
          [10] "The results for binding energy vs. the surface d-band center are depicted in Fig. 6 c."
          [11] "It is also apparent from Fig. 6 c that the binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1)."
          [12] "The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared in order to study the effect of cyclic structure and the results showed that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces."

          DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption of three linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were compared against the d-band center of the substrates. The binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene was shown in figures. The binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) were uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces were compared with DFT calculations. The activities for each bimetallic surface were listed, and it was found that the binding energy of cyclohexene was consistent with the experimental results. The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined, and the observations were consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures was very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared to study the effect of cyclic structure, and the results showed that the binding energy was lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

          使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算研究了三种线性烯烃（1-丁烯、1-戊烯和1-己烯）在单金属和双金属过渡金属表面上的吸附。将这些烯烃在不同表面上的结合能与基底的d带中心进行了比较。1-丁烯、1-戊烯和1-己烯的结合能与d带中心的关系在图中显示。总体而言，线性烯烃在次表面双金属（PtNiPt、PtCuPt、PtCoPt、PtFePt）上的结合能均匀低于Pt（1 1 1）表面。将Ni/Pt（1 1 1）和Cu/Pt（1 1 1）表面上的环己烯剂量后的TPD结果与DFT计算进行了比较。列出了每个双金属表面的活性，发现环己烯的结合能与实验结果一致。还检查了环己烯与Cu/Pt（1 1 1）双金属表面的相互作用，观察结果与这三种表面上环己烯结合能的DFT结果一致。所有次表面Pt3dPt（1 1 1）结构上的结合与Pt（1 1 1）相比非常弱。将1-己烯和环己烯的结合进行比较，以研究环状结构的影响，结果表明，几乎在所有双金属表面上，环状结构的结合能较低。集成的理论和实验方法可用于预测氢化活性，并指导更有效的Pt-3d催化系统的开发。
