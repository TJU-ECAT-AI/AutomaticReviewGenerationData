DFT calculations show that the Pt-terminated surfaces of bimetallic Pt-3d catalysts bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation. This is consistent with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, which have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The enhancement in hydrogenation rates can be attributed to the presence of the Pt-terminated catalyst configurations in the bimetallic catalysts. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. According to DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation.

DFT calculations by Goda et al. revealed that 1-butene and 1-hexene bind more weakly to the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure than to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, a trend similar to that observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions through TPD measurements of low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These findings suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations have been conducted for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. Based on binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to exhibit high hydrogenation activity for these molecules, a prediction that has been validated in reactor studies.

The literature does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it correlate these calculations with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different surfaces, and that the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst. The optimized configurations for 1,4-CHD and DFT calculation results for different bimetallic surfaces are shown in Figure 3. The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111).

DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption of three linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were compared against the d-band center of the substrates. The binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene was shown in figures. The binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) were uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces were compared with DFT calculations. The activities for each bimetallic surface were listed, and it was found that the binding energy of cyclohexene was consistent with the experimental results. The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined, and the observations were consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures was very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared to study the effect of cyclic structure, and the results showed that the binding energy was lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

The literature does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it correlate these calculations with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were used to determine the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on different surfaces, and that the binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst. The optimized configurations for 1,4-CHD and DFT calculation results for different bimetallic surfaces are shown in Figure 3. The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111).

DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption of three linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were compared against the d-band center of the substrates. The binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene was shown in figures. The binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) were uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces were compared with DFT calculations. The activities for each bimetallic surface were listed, and it was found that the binding energy of cyclohexene was consistent with the experimental results. The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined, and the observations were consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures was very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared to study the effect of cyclic structure, and the results showed that the binding energy was lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

The document does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does mention that DFT calculations have been used to determine the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on corresponding model surfaces, and these binding energies were found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity. This suggests that an integrated theoretical and experimental approach can potentially be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
