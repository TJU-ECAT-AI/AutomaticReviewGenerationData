DFT calculations elucidate that the Pt-terminated surfaces of bimetallic Pt-3d catalysts exhibit weaker bonding with hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are accountable for higher hydrogenation rates \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. This observation is corroborated by experimental findings from TPD measurements, which demonstrate that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts manifest superior hydrogenation rates for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene over the monometallic Pt catalyst \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. The enhancement in hydrogenation rates can be attributed to the presence of Pt-terminated configurations in the bimetallic catalysts \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for a variety of C═C bond-containing molecules, encompassing linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, on Pt-3d catalysts, align with experimental observations from TPD measurements \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be harnessed to forecast hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. Goda et al. performed DFT calculations for 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, revealing that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds these molecules more weakly than Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, mirroring the trend observed for cyclohexene \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. Murillo et al. substantiated these predictions through TPD measurements of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111) \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. These results underscore the potential of DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy as descriptors for catalysts with commendable hydrogenation activity \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. Similar DFT calculations have been executed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. Based on binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, supported Pt3d catalysts are anticipated to display high hydrogenation activity for these molecules, a prediction that has been substantiated in reactor studies \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The amalgamation of DFT calculations and experimental techniques, such as TPD measurements, has proven instrumental in elucidating the structure-activity relationships of Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. This integrated approach not only facilitates the prediction of hydrogenation activity but also informs the design of more efficient catalytic systems. Future research endeavors might concentrate on the exploration of novel bimetallic configurations and the optimization of subsurface structures to further enhance the catalytic performance. Additionally, the development of advanced computational methodologies and the refinement of experimental techniques could provide deeper insights into the catalytic mechanisms and enable the design of catalysts with tailored properties for specific hydrogenation reactions. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could potentially accelerate the discovery of new catalysts by predicting the hydrogenation activity of a wide range of materials with high accuracy.

DFT calculations elucidate that bimetallic Pt-3d catalysts, with Pt-terminated surfaces, exhibit weaker bonding to hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that correlate with higher hydrogenation rates \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. This observation is corroborated by experimental techniques such as TPD measurements, which have demonstrated that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts outperform monometallic Pt in hydrogenation rates for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\].

Murillo et al. validated these predictions through TPD measurements of low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111) \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. These findings suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\]. Similar calculations have been conducted for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces \[10.1021/cr300096b\_8\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in DFT calculations and their successful correlation with experimental observations from TPD measurements underscore the potential for an integrated theoretical and experimental approach in predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Future research endeavors might focus on expanding the scope of DFT calculations to encompass a broader range of C═C bond-containing molecules and exploring the effects of different bimetallic compositions on catalyst performance. Additionally, the development of novel experimental techniques that can provide more detailed insights into the catalytic mechanisms at the molecular level could further enhance our understanding and predictive capabilities. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could also offer a promising avenue for accelerating the discovery of new catalysts with optimized properties. These advancements could significantly contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.
