This is consistent with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, which have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The enhancement in hydrogenation rates can be attributed to the presence of the Pt-terminated catalyst configurations in the bimetallic catalysts. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements.
