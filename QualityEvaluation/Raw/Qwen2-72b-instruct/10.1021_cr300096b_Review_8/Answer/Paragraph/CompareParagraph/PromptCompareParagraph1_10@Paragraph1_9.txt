The comprehensive analysis of Pt-3d catalysts for C═C bond hydrogenation involves a multidisciplinary approach that integrates density functional theory (DFT) calculations, experimental validation, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) to advance catalyst design and predict performance. DFT calculations provide insights into the electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts, enabling the prediction of their reactivity towards C═C bond hydrogenation. These computational predictions are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanisms and identifying the active sites on the catalyst surface. Experimental validation through spectroscopic and kinetic studies confirms the theoretical predictions, ensuring the accuracy of the computational models. Structure-activity relationships, derived from both computational and experimental data, correlate the catalyst's structure with its activity and selectivity, guiding the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalysts. This integrated approach not only accelerates the development of new catalysts but also deepens the fundamental understanding of the catalytic processes involved in C═C bond hydrogenation.

4.1.1.2 Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of Olefins, Dienes, and Aromatics
Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of C═C bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt&ndash;3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111). These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt&ndash;3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.
Hydrogenation of 1,3-Butadiene, 1,3-Cyclohexadiene, And 1,4-Cyclohexadiene
Bimetallic Pt&ndash;M (M = Co, Ni, Cu) are active toward the low-temperature hydrogenation of all three molecules when supported on γ-Al2O3. (238, 243) Pt&ndash;Ni and Pt&ndash;Co bimetallic catalysts both show higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt. The Pt&ndash;Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows lower activity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 in batch and flow reactor studies; however, Pt&ndash;Cu/γ-Al2O3 shows higher selectivity toward cyclohexene and butenes than the other catalysts, indicating that it is a promising catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions. (238, 243) Similarly to the Pt&ndash;Ni bimetallic catalyst, the surface structure of the Pt&ndash;Cu catalyst has been shown to be influenced by the surrounding atmosphere. (307) The Pt&ndash;Fe/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst also shows higher selectivity toward 1-butene rather than full hydrogenation to n-butane. (288)
The hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene has also been used as a probe reaction to further understand the catalytic properties of supported Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts. Combined EXAFS characterization and reactor studies compare Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts prepared using either sequential or coimpregnation methods. The results reveal that coimpregnation leads to higher hydrogenation activity and that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of Pt&ndash;Ni bimetallic bond formation. (143) Furthermore, by comparing the hydrogenation activity of Pt&ndash;Ni supported over low- and high-surface-area alumina and zirconia, it is revealed that the surface area of the oxide supports also plays a role in controlling the hydrogenation rate of 1,3-butadiene. (276)
Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene in Ethylene
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene is an important reaction because acetylene poisons the catalysts in ethylene polymerization reactions. (308) The Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts show a higher selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of excess ethylene than the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. (303) The selective hydrogenation of acetylene is also a probe reaction to determine the effect of impregnation sequence of the Pt and Ni metal precursors. By impregnating Pt first, the bimetallic catalyst is much more active for acetylene hydrogenation. EXAFS measurements confirm bimetallic bond formation in the Pt-first catalyst but not in the Ni-first catalyst, likely due to the possible diffusion of Ni2+ into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support to produce Ni aluminate. However, at higher Ni loadings the impregnation sequence does not seem to play an important role. (303)
Hydrogenation of Aromatics
The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is of significant importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental protection. The process of benzene hydrogenation has been utilized commercially for the production of cyclohexane, which is one of the key intermediates in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and Nylon-66. (309) DFT calculations identified Pt&ndash;Co bimetallic catalysts as promising materials for the hydrogenation of benzene, which were confirmed experimentally over supported Pt&ndash;Co/γ-Al2O3 at a relatively low temperature of 343 K. (280, 310) The hydrogenation rate over Pt&ndash;Co/γ-Al2O3 was significantly higher than that over Co/γ-Al2O3 or Pt/γ-Al2O3. (279, 280) Comparative studies have also been performed on different supports that reveal that hydrogenation of benzene at 343 K over Pt&ndash;Co bimetallic catalysts follows the activity trend of activated carbon (AC) ≫ SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The AC support exhibits the highest activity and performance due to the greatest extent of Pt&ndash;Co bimetallic formation from the EXAFS measurements. (277) Another feature of Pt&ndash;Co supported catalysts is that almost all Pt atoms in these catalysts exist in the form of Pt&ndash;Co, and the remaining Co forms a Co phase on the metal oxide support. (295)
In addition to bimetallic bond formation, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts improve performance by increasing the reducibility of alloyed metals. (171, 311) For example, Pt&ndash;Ni, Pt, and Ni supported on SiO2 and mixed TiO2 + SiO2 oxides were tested for the hydrogenation of toluene to methylcyclohexane for the production of cleaner-burning fuels. TPR experiments indicated that Pt promoted the reducibility of NiO, partially explaining the increased activity of the bimetallic Pt&ndash;Ni catalyst compared with either monometallic catalyst. (278)
Reports of hydrogenation activity on Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts have been conflicting. Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts supported on mixed magnesium and aluminum oxides are active for the removal of aromatics from diesel fuel to lower emissions. A higher Pd/Pt ratio leads to higher hydrogenation of naphthalene. (138) However, the activity of Pt&ndash;Pd/γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of toluene does not show any synergistic activity, with the activity of the bimetallic catalyst being simply the sum of the activity of each monometallic catalyst. (168) The difference in reports seen on Pt&ndash;Pd may be due to different preparation techniques because different techniques have been shown to strongly influence the degree of bimetallic bond formation. (312)
Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts have exhibited a stronger bimetallic effect and greater sulfur tolerance when promoted with fluorine. Pt&ndash;Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation for hydrogenation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than the unpromoted Pt&ndash;Pd catalyst. EXAFS analysis showed that the Pt&ndash;Pd alloy was disrupted at high conversions of reactants, but the catalysts synthesized with F did not exhibit a disruption of the Pt&ndash;Pd bonds. (139) Babu et al. have shown that the interaction of Pt with Pd led to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states at the Pd sites. This electronic modification may be the cause of improved catalytic performance of Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts with high coordination numbers for bimetallic Pt&ndash;Pd bonds. (313)
Hydrogenation of m-Cresol
The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of m-cresol was performed over Pt&ndash;Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 to determine the role of hydrogenation for HDO. (314) The bimetallic catalysts were found to be very active toward the saturation of the aromatic ring, leading to a facile HDO rate in combination with the dehydration function of the γ-Al2O3 support. Because of the importance of HDO in converting biomass-derived oxygenates to fuels and chemicals, it is anticipated that the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt&ndash;3d bimetallic catalysts should play a significant role in HDO catalysis.
