Abstract
A combination of two synchrotron X-ray techniques, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and pair distribution function analysis (PDF) with complementary Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurement, was used to characterize the composition distributions of PdAu and PtCu bimetallic particles after treatment in H2 or CO and in the presence of these gases. This is the first reported application of PDF to the study of supported bimetallic nanoparticles. We found that XAS was informative in determining the component distribution of an initial sample, but PDF was better suited to following changes in the distribution upon changing the gas environment. Thus, the surface of a PtCu bimetallic particle of about 2.5 nm after treatment in H2 was found to be enriched in Cu, while the core was bimetallic. There was no evidence of a component-segregated core−shell structure. Treatment in CO caused enrichment of Pt to the surface layer, with a concomitant migration of Cu to the core. The average particle size remained the same. For the PdAu bimetallic particles, the surface and core compositions were similar after H2 treatment, and Pd was enriched in the surface after CO treatment. The X-ray results compared favorably to infrared spectroscopy results. The results demonstrated that the two X-ray techniques in combination can generate new information not available with either technique alone or other techniques, about the elemental distribution of bimetallic particles under conditions relevant to catalysis. They could provide new insight into structure−function relationships and time-on-stream behavior of bimetallic catalysts.

1 Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts constitute some of the most important industrial catalysts. The potential for synergy, be it by ensemble effect or electronic effect, offers the possibility to manipulate and design catalysts for specific functions. To realize these potentials, it is important to have information on the surface compositions of the particles and their response to the environments to which they will be subjected, so that changes in function can be understood. It is well-known that bimetallics are commonly surface enriched in one component (1-3) and that the equilibrium surface composition, which may differ from the steady-state surface composition in a reaction mixture, is determined by the surrounding atmosphere. (3-7) For small particles in which the number of atoms in the surface layer is comparable to the bulk, the compositions of the bulk and the surface are expected to be strongly correlated. Thus, in order to fully understand the properties and their relationship to the functions of bimetallic particles, it is important to characterize not only the surface or the initial composition but also the bulk and changes in the bimetallic particles.
While a number of techniques have proven useful for characterizing surface compositions and surface segregation, many, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger, are only applicable under vacuum conditions. (4, 6, 8-11) Although recent developments have permitted measurements in subatmospheric pressure regime, (12) the “pressure gap” problem cannot be ignored. Techniques that operate at atmospheric or higher pressures, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, (5) chemisorption measurements, (13) or via electrochemical polarization (14) also have their restrictions. FTIR spectroscopy requires a structural probe, such as CO, that cannot be used if one is interested in in situ measurement of a process that does not contain or is affected by the presence of the probe. Electrochemical polarization and chemisorption require measurement conditions that are likely to affect the structure of the sample or are not applicable to catalysis.
The ideal tool would be operable through a range of temperatures and pressures, make a direct measurement of the sample without affecting it, and provide quantitative and temporal information about surface and bulk composition and how they respond to reaction conditions. An analytical technique that meets these specifications would be extremely helpful in the study of time-on-stream effects in a wide array of catalytic systems. While not as easily accessible as other techniques, synchrotron-based X-ray techniques are very promising for fulfilling these criteria. For example, X-ray absorption (EXAFS) has been applied successfully to characterize bimetallic catalysts. (15, 16)
We have investigated the application of two synchrotron X-ray techniques, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and pair distribution function analysis (PDF), to the characterization of the surface and bulk compositions of PtCu and PdAu bimetallic particles with emphasis on their changes in response to exposure to CO. The main goal of this work was to determine the response of both bulk and the surface compositions of these particles to the environment, and to generate experimental results that could be used for computational investigations of these particles. This paper also represents the first reported application of PDF to the analysis of supported bimetallic nanoparticles. The XAS and PDF experiments were performed on the same samples, and the results were compared. The PtCu and PdAu bimetallics were chosen because information is available on the expected changes in their surface compositions upon exposure to CO, (17-21) and the X-ray absorption edges of the metals could be probed by the beamline used. The X-ray measurements were complemented with FTIR.
2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Sample Preparation
2.1.1 PtCu/Al2O3
The γ-Al2O3 support was prepared by adding 18 mL distilled deionized (DDI) water dropwise to a vigorously stirred mixture of 20 g of aluminum isopropoxide (Aldrich, 98+%) in 52 mL isopropyl alcohol (Aldrich, USP) at 70 °C. After the addition of water, the mixture was stirred for 1 h and then suction filtered, rinsed repeatedly with isopropyl alcohol, and dried overnight at 110 °C. The dried solid was crushed and calcined in air at 700 °C for 2 h. X-ray diffraction measurements of the final product confirmed the γ-Al2O3 structure. The BET surface area was 225 m2/g and the liquid pore volume was experimentally determined to be 1.1 mL/g.
The metals were introduced by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using stock solutions of Cu(NH3)42+ and (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2. The former was prepared by dissolving 690 mg Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O (Aldrich, 99.99+%) in 8 mL DDI water and 2 mL 29% (w/v) aqueous NH4OH (Fisher) to form a 0.3 M Cu(NH3)42+ solution. The latter was prepared from 390 mg (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 (Strem, 99%) in 10 mL DDI water. For the monometallic samples, 4.4 mL of the appropriate metal precursor solution was impregnated into 2 g γ-Al2O3 in two equal portions with drying of the samples at 110 °C for 3 h after each addition. For the bimetallic sample, a similar procedure was followed with four alternating impregnation-drying steps of 2.2 mL each into 2 g γ-Al2O3, starting with the copper solution (two additions of each solution). All the samples were calcined in air at 250 °C for 2.5 h and reduced in pure hydrogen at 350 °C for 1 h. The sample compositions were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to be Pt (4.1 wt %), Cu (4.9 wt %), PtCu (4.0 and 3.8 wt %, respectively). The Cu/Pt molar ratio in the bimetallic was approximately 3:1. These reduced samples will be referred to as “as-prepared” samples. The particle size distribution of the bimetallic as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was 2.5 ± 1.7 nm (image in Supporting Information, Figure S1).
2.1.2 PdAu/TiO2
This sample was prepared following the method of Crooks et al., (22-24) using dendrimers as templates for the structure of the nanoparticles and the support. This technique was expected to yield a narrow size distribution. Stock solutions of 0.05 M K2PdCl4 (Aldrich, 99.99%) and 0.10 M HAuCl4 (Aldrich, 99.999%), 100 μM hydroxyl-terminated PAMAM dendrimer (Aldrich, 10 wt % in methanol), 0.3 M NaOH (Fisher, A.C.S.), and 0.3 M HCl (Mallinckrodt, A.C.S.) were prepared. To a 1.325 L solution of methanol (Aldrich, 99.9%), 150 mL of PAMAM stock solution was added and the entire solution was purged with nitrogen for 1 h and kept under nitrogen pressure until the filtration step. Next, 10.5 mL Pd stock solution was added followed by 15 min stirring. Then 3.0 mL Au stock solution was added and allowed to stir for 1.5 min before the addition of a freshly prepared solution of 125 mg NaBH4 (Aldrich, 99.99%) in 3.3 mL NaOH stock solution. According to the commonly used nomenclature, (22-24) the reduced, encapsulated particles were “Pd35Au20”. After 1 day of stirring, 7.8 mL of HCl stock solution was added to neutralize the solution before addition of 7.5 mL titanium isopropoxide (Aldrich, 99.999%). No visible hydrolysis (cloudiness in solution) of the titanium isopropoxide was observed until dropwise addition of 100 mL DDI water. After a final 1 day stirring, the solid was filtered and washed repeatedly with DDI water until no chloride could be detected in the rinsewater using Quantab test strips (<4 ppm).
The samples for XAS and PDF experiments were then treated to remove the dendrimer template by vacuum drying and calcinations for 1 h in 10% O2 in He at 400 °C, purging with He, heating for 1 h in H2 at 400 °C, then purging and cooling in He. The temperature was chosen based on two experiments. The first examined the FTIR intensity of adsorbed CO after flowing 2% CO in He over the sample at room temperature after a given treatment. We found that a sample treated at 300 °C adsorbed some CO, but the one treated at 400 °C adsorbed more, while the one treated at 500 °C had a lower intensity CO adsorption peak, presumably due to agglomeration of the particles. A second experiment used diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to track decomposition of the dendrimer-related peaks. The majority of the peaks assigned to the dendrimer disappeared after 300 °C treatment, and they completely disappeared with 400 °C treatment. These results were consistent with previous reports. (25) The XRF wt % loadings were 2.7% for Pd and 2.8% for Au, which gave a 1.8:1 Pd/Au molar ratio consistent with the Pd35Au20 label within error. The particle size determined by TEM was 10.4 ± 1.0 nm (image in Supporting Information, Figure S1).
2.2 FTIR Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectroscopy data were collected in transmission mode with an in situ cell and a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer with a MCT detector, using a resolution of 2 cm−1 and 50 averaged scans. The self-supporting wafers were made from 5 mg sample mixed with 35 mg γ-Al2O3. The wafers were reduced in H2 at 350 °C for 1 h and further treated as described in Results. All spectra were collected in the presence of 2% CO in He.
2.3 X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
X-ray absorption experiments were carried out at beamline 5-BM-D of the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. All data were collected in transmission mode under controlled temperature and gas environment using a custom in situ cell. The cell consisted of two concentric cylinders with Kapton windows at the ends and a thermocouple port for internal temperature measurement just downstream of the sample. Gas entered via the outer cylinder, swept through the region between the cylinders, and exited from the inner cylinder after passing through the self-supporting wafer, which was mounted at the gas inlet of the inner cylinder. For data collection, the monochromator was detuned by 30% to reject higher harmonics, and the edge energies chosen were Cu K at 8.9789 keV, Pd K at 24.3503 keV, Pt LIII at 11.5637 keV, and Au LIII at 11.9187 keV. For clarity, when discussing coordination shells or bonding, “PtCu” and “PdAu” will refer to the heterometallic phase as measured at the Pt edge or Pd edge, respectively, and vice versa. Likewise, “CuPt” and “AuPd” would be for measurements made at the Cu edge or Au edge, respectively.
Data processing and fitting was done using the WinXAS software package. (26) For each sample, two scans were averaged prior to further processing. Metal foils, CuO, Cu2O, PdO, Na2Pt(OH)6, and Au(OH)3 were used as references for M−M and M−O distances. The four heterometallic references were calculated using FEFF 8.10. (27) Two important consistency checks were employed to ensure sensible results from all fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The first was that the fitted heterometallic bond distance should be the same from measurements at the absorption edge of either metal. In practice, after a few fitting iterations the bond distance was fixed to an average value to ensure satisfaction of this requirement. The second was an expected relation between the heterometallic coordination numbers, for example, CNPtCu and CNCuPt. (28) In general for any absorption edge, the number of atoms measured multiplied by the fitted coordination number should approximate the total number of bonds of that type. Therefore
Using this relationship, for example, a sample of 3:1 Cu/Pt molar ratio should result in CNPtCu three times larger than CNCuPt.
2.4 Pair Distribution Function
High-energy X-ray scattering data (λ = 0.2128 Å) for analysis of the pair distribution function (PDF) were collected at beamline 11-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Loose powder samples were loaded into glass capillaries with 1.1 mm OD and ∼0.7 mm ID. The samples were either treated as described later and then the capillaries were flame-sealed on both ends, or they were loaded into the custom in situ flow cell at 11-ID-B, which allows for controlled gas environment and temperatures between 80 and 873 K, for in situ treatment. All data were collected at 100 K. For each PDF, an amorphous silicon image plate detector was used to collect 500 images that were averaged, integrated, and converted to intensity versus scattering angle with the Fit2D software package. (29, 30) The PDFgetX2 (31) software package was then used to apply standard corrections for polarization, absorption, Compton scattering, and oblique incidence to the integrated data to obtain the reduced structure function F(Q), and for the Fourier transformation of F(Q) to G(r) with Qmax of 20 Å−1. Fityk was used for Gaussian peak deconvolution and fitting. A more detailed description of the data analysis procedure is in the Supporting Information.
The PDF analysis uses the total X-ray scattering data (sum of the diffuse and Bragg scattering components) to yield atomic resolution structural data. Since PDF represents the probability of finding two atoms separated by a distance r, it inherently provides information about the entire sample, including the metal particles and the support. By taking the difference between two PDFs (a d-PDF), for example, one for the metal particles on a support and the other for the bare support, one can isolate the feature of interest, which is the metal particles. (32-34) We employed d-PDF to analyze the bimetallic nanoparticles supported on a metal oxide. As illustrated in Figure 1, the d-PDF technique allows removal of the metal oxide structure, leaving the structure of the nanoparticles to be analyzed.

2.5 Sample Treatment
CO treatment was used to induce composition distribution changes in the bimetallic particles. Because CO adsorbs much more strongly on Pt and Pd than Cu and Au, (17, 18) respectively, a gas environment containing CO was expected to cause surface enrichment of Pt or Pd. (3) Replacing the strongly adsorbing CO gas with a nonadsorbing gas was expected to reverse the changes, because clean Cu and Au surfaces have lower surface energy than Pt and Pd surfaces, respectively. (3, 19-21) Sample treatment times and temperatures were varied and are described below. Prior to CO treatment, the as-prepared samples were subjected to a H2 flow at 350 °C (PtCu) or 400 °C (PdAu) for 1 h to produce the “reduced” sample. Once treated, samples were stored in isolation from oxygen in a gas environment matching the most recent treatment.
3 Results
3.1 PtCu
3.1.1 FTIR Spectroscopy
Figure 2 shows FTIR spectroscopy data for CO adsorbed on reduced Cu/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and PtCu/Al2O3 after exposure to 2% CO in He for 30 min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Peaks at 2090 and 2054 cm−1 were due to CO adsorbed on Cu and Pt, respectively, in agreement with the literature. (35-39) For the bimetallic sample, the peaks were shifted to 2110 and 2002 cm−1 for adsorption on Cu (PtCu-CO) and Pt (CuPt-CO), respectively, similar to the shifts expected based on literature reports. (40-42) The CuPt-CO peak decreased in intensity more dramatically than the PtCu-CO peak, relative to the Pt and Cu standards.

Treating a reduced PtCu sample in flowing 2% CO in He at 275 °C for 1 h and then cooling it to 20 °C caused several changes in the FTIR spectrum (Figure 3). The relative intensity of the CuPt-CO peak increased and its position shifted by 8 cm−1, and the PtCu-CO peak intensity decreased and shifted by 3 cm−1, both to a higher frequency. Within error, subsequent treatment in H2 for 1 h at 275 °C reversed the room temperature CO spectral changes back to the initial spectrum. Purging in He at 275 °C for 1 h did not cause any further change (not shown).

3.1.2 XAS
The near-edge absorption at the Pt and Cu edges are shown in Figure 4. There are clear differences between the spectra of the monometallic and the bimetallic samples, specifically in the node positions. The average coordination numbers (CNs) of the PtCu samples based on fitting of EXAFS data are shown in Table 1 (complete EXAFS fitting results in Supporting Information). The total coordination number of Pt (CNPtPt + CNPtCu) was ∼12, suggesting full nearest neighbor coordination. On the other hand, the total coordination of Cu (i.e., CNCuCu + CNCuPt) was between 7 and 8. High-quality fits could only be achieved when heterometallic shells were included, and the expected relationship of CNPtCu/CNCuPt = 3 was observed within error. The effects of the sample treatment on the composition distribution are also summarized in Table 1. The CO treatment was 5−6 h at 350 °C or 2 weeks at room temperature (RT) in 2% CO in He. The total number of nearest neighbor pairs did not change significantly, indicating no detectable change in average particle size. However, no trends could be identified beyond uncertainties in Δ(CN). A similar conclusion applied to the observations after subsequent H2 treatments for 2 h at 350 °C; the resulting Δ(CN)s were also within experimental error.

3.1.3 PDF
Figure 5 shows d-PDFs in the first coordination shell from reduced Cu/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and PtCu/Al2O3 samples. The PtCu plot differed from a superposition of the Pt and Cu plots that would be expected for a physical mixture of Cu and Pt particles or a perfect core−shell bimetallic. Instead, a single broader peak at a bond length between pure Cu and pure Pt was observed. To glean further information from the X-ray scattering data of the static structure, it is necessary to deconvolute the data from the bimetallic into three underlying peaks (Cu−Cu, Pt−Pt, and Pt−Cu). Because deconvoluting a Gaussian into three smaller Gaussians is not a very rigorous process, we chose to only examine changes in the underlying peaks rather than absolute values.
Figure 5
Figure 5. d-PDFs for reduced, Al2O3-supported Cu, Pt, and PtCu. Samples were sealed in glass capillaries after reduction in H2 at 350 °C followed by He purging during cooling to room temperature. Data was collected at 100 K.
Four samples were used to examine changes due to sample treatment. They were exposed to 2% CO in He at room temperature in a flame-sealed glass capillary for 1 week (2 samples) or 4 months (2 samples). To extract structural information from the d-PDFs, we analyzed changes in the areas and positions of the Cu−Cu, Pt−Pt, and Pt−Cu peaks from the first three coordination shells obtained by deconvoluting the composite peaks (Figure S3 in Supporting Information). There were no detectable systematic variations in the peak positions beyond experimental uncertainties. On the other hand, the peak area changes were beyond error, and they are summarized in Figure 6. Relative to the total number of bonds in each coordination shell (Cu−Cu + Pt−Pt + Pt−Cu), the number of Pt−Pt bonds decreased, while Cu−Cu and Pt−Cu bonds increased in all three shells. Higher coordination shells were not included because of poor signal-to-noise ratios. Other samples were treated in situ in 2% CO in He at 350 °C for up to 8 h, but no changes beyond experimental error were observed (not shown).

The composition distribution changes were induced by room temperature CO treatment of reduced samples in sealed glass capillaries for 4 months or 1 week.
3.2 PdAu
3.2.1 XAS
Table 2 shows the fitted CNs for the PdAu sample before and after CO and H2 treatment (complete EXAFS fitting results in Supporting Information). The spectra could be fitted well with combinations of Au−Au, Pd−Pd, Pd−Au, and Au−Pd coordinations. The expected relationship between CNPdAu and CNAuPd was observed, but the uncertainties in Δ(CN)s induced by sample treatment were so large to make it meaningless to derive any useful conclusions, similar to the case of the PtCu samples.

3.2.2 PDF
As with the PtCu samples, the PDF analysis was found to be much more useful for detecting small changes in the PdAu samples. Changes in the number of bonds relative to the total for the three nearest coordination shells are shown in Figure 7. After exposing a reduced sample to 2% CO in He for 1 week at room temperature, the number of Au−Au bonds increased, whereas the number of Au−Pd and Pd−Pd bonds decreased. The changes in samples treated in situ in 2% CO in He for 8 h at 350 °C were again within the uncertainty of the PDF analysis.

4 Discussion
Theoretically, in the absence of experimental limitations the X-ray techniques used here could provide quantitative information about the distribution of components in a bimetallic particle. However, limitations due to signal-to-noise and sample inhomogeneity made it much more difficult to obtain. In practice, for supported metal catalysts, even with the highly intense synchrotron source currently available, XAS provides reliable coordination information consistently only for the first coordination shell, although occasionally for the second shell and beyond. Thus, there is very little XAS information on component distribution in a bimetallic sample reported in the literature. Likewise, PDF has been used successfully with a variety of macroscale crystalline and noncrystalline materials, (43-47) but very few reports describe its application to supported metal nanoparticles.
By capturing the reliable, element-specific, first coordination shell information from XAS and changes in coordination from PDF, our results have shown that these two techniques in combination can generate new information not available with either technique alone. This can be illustrated with the PtCu data. Table 1 shows that, for the reduced sample, the total CN for Pt (Pt−Pt and Pt−Cu) was 12.8 ± 0.9, close to the value of 12 for a bulk FCC structure, whereas the total CN for Cu (Cu−Cu and Cu−Pt) was 7.2 ± 0.6. The much lower total CN for Cu indicates that Cu was preferentially segregated to the surface. The composition weighted average first shell CN was 8.6 (=3(CNCu−Cu + CNCu−Pt)/4 + (CNPt−Cu + CNPt−Pt)/4), which corresponds to an average particle size of about 2.5 nm, (48) in agreement with the TEM results. If one assumes the PtCu particle to be a perfect core−shell, using the average particle size of 2.5 nm and the 3:1 Cu/Pt molar ratio of the metals, the expected CNPt−Cu can be calculated to be about 2, since Pt−Pt would constitute almost all of the nearest neighbor bonds in the core. The observed CNPt−Cu was 5.2, suggesting that the elements do not conform to a perfect core−shell distribution. Instead, the data are more consistent with a particle having a well-mixed interior that is rich in Pt, and a surface enriched in Cu. This is consistent with computational results predicting that Pt would prefer to mix with Cu instead of remaining as pure Pt. (20)
Uncertainties in the data prevented determination of changes in elemental distribution in the particle due to CO exposure using XAS, but PDF analysis of the changes was successful. The positions of the peaks in the d-PDFs of reduced bimetallic particles were consistent with a mixed core instead of pure Pt, since the bond distance of the first-shell neighbors was approximately the average of the Pt−Pt and Cu−Cu distances (Figure 5). After exposure to CO, the number of Pt−Pt neighbors decreased, while the numbers of Pt−Cu and Cu−Cu neighbors increased. This can be explained by migration of Pt from the core to the surface and displacement of Cu atoms to the core. The increase in Pt−Cu neighbors was a consequence of Pt being diluted into the Cu rich shell as it moved toward the surface, replacing Pt−Pt bonds with Pt−Cu bonds. The increase in Pt−Cu neighbors also confirms that the particles were not completely homogeneous initially, because if they had been a homogeneous mixture, CO treatment would have caused a decrease in Pt−Cu neighbors as the metals began to segregate. Finally, changes in the number of neighbors as derived from the PDF analysis cannot be due to large changes in particle size distribution because the total first shell coordination numbers determined by XAS did not change beyond uncertainty, implying no change in the average particle size.
Roughly 40% of the atoms in a 2.5 nm particle are on the surface. Since the Cu/Pt ratio was 3:1, there were insufficient Pt atoms to form one complete surface layer. In fact, Pt would constitute only 63% of the surface even if all Pt was on the surface, and the first shell Pt−Pt CN would be <6. After CO treatment, the observed first shell Pt−Pt CN was 7.2, as calculated by subtracting the change in Pt1 (Figure 6) from 7.6 (Table 1) for the reduced sample. This implies that some of the Pt atoms remained beneath the surface to coordinate to surface Pt atoms. In fact, the Pt atoms likely formed patches at the surface in order to account for the high CN of 7.2.
This picture is consistent with the IR results. It is known that electronic interaction between Pt and Cu in a bimetallic causes about a 20 cm−1 shift in the adsorption frequencies of CO on each metal. (35, 40-42, 49) It has also been shown that dipole−dipole coupling of CO adsorbed on Pt causes both a blue shift of about 30 cm−1 relative to the frequency of an isolated adsorbed CO and the typically observed asymmetry in the Pt-CO peak. (40, 42) Thus, for the reduced PtCu sample (Figure 2), the 20 cm−1 shift in the PtCu-CO compared to the Cu sample is due to electronic interaction of Pt with Cu, whereas the 52 cm−1 shift in the CuPt-CO peak relative to Pt-CO is due to a combination of electronic interaction between the metals and a decrease in dipole−dipole coupling due to dilution of Pt by Cu in the sample. The presence of nearby PtCu-CO species would not be expected to have an effect on CuPt-CO through dipole coupling because the vibration frequencies are well separated. (40, 41)
For the CO treated PtCu sample (Figure 3), the 3 cm−1 blue shift in the PtCu≡CO peak suggests an increased interaction between the metals. (41) The 8 cm−1 blue shift for CuPt-CO was likely a result of a similar increased interaction between the metals, which would cause a red shift, and an increase in dipole−dipole coupling due to an increase in Pt surface concentration, which would cause a stronger blue shift. The increase in CuPt-CO intensity versus the decrease in PtCu-CO intensity also points to surface enrichment of Pt. These are consistent with the conclusions from the XAS and PDF results. Further treatment in H2 reversed some of these changes, as the sample became more similar to the initial reduced state.
For the PdAu sample, the total CNs for both elements were close to 12, implying large particles, in agreement with TEM results. The X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) curve shapes (Figure S4 in Supporting Information), and EXAFS fitting (Table 2) confirmed that the metals were reduced and that bimetallic particles were formed. The fact that there were no large differences between the total CNs for Pd and Au suggests no significant surface enrichment of either component. Similar to the PtCu, uncertainty in the XAS results prevented any useful conclusions regarding changes in the elemental distribution as a result of CO treatment. Such information was instead derived from the PDF results, which showed an increase in the Au−Au bonds while the Pd−Pd bonds and Pd−Au bonds decreased, implying a CO-induced enrichment of Pd to the surface. This is in agreement with the expected chemical properties of the two metals.
5 Conclusion
We have demonstrated that a combination of XAS and PDF can generate new and useful information on the elemental distribution of a bimetallic particle of the size commonly found in catalysts and described the first reported application of PDF to the analysis of supported bimetallic nanoparticles. When applied to PtCu bimetallic particles of about 2.5 nm, the techniques could distinguish the model of particles consisting of a surface layer enriched in Cu with a bimetallic core from the model of the particles having a core−shell structure with segregated components. They can also monitor changes in the surface composition and concurrent changes in the core composition, caused, for example, by gas treatment. Since these techniques monitor the solid directly, they are independent of the nature of the adsorbate or gas atmosphere. Thus, they can detect changes when techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy or vacuum techniques are uninformative. Since they do not require vacuum, they can be used for samples in a reaction medium. In short, they are versatile in situ techniques.
Although these techniques can potentially provide quantitative elemental distribution information, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data poses a limit to achieving it. This limitation can be eased with samples of higher metal loadings, smaller and more uniform particles, more intense X-rays or a higher resolution detector. Thus, complementary use of XAS and PDF is very promising for truly in situ structural analyses of bimetallic nanoparticles, that, when coupled with catalytic studies, could provide new insight into structure function relationships and time-on-stream effects for bimetallic catalysts.
