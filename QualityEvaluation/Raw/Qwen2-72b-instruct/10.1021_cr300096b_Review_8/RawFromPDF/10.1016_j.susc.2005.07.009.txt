Abstract
The reaction pathways of 1-hexene have been investigated on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces at diﬀerent Ni coverages using
Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). A low-temperature self-hydro-
genation pathway to produce hexane is detected at the monolayer Ni coverage at 247 K. In addition to self-hydroge-
nation, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydrogenation to produce trace amount of hexadiene, dehydro-cyclization to
produce benzene, and complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. The presence of pre-adsorbed
hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other
reaction pathways. Furthermore, the reaction pathways of 1-butene, cyclohexene, and benzene were compared on the
monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to determine the eﬀect of chain length and molecular structure on the low-temperature
hydrogenation pathway. The comparison indicates that the two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene and cyclohexene, show similar
self-hydrogenation activity; in contrast, self-hydrogenation does not occur for 1-butene. The hydrogenation of all three
alkenes occurs readily in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, while the hydro-
genation of benzene does not occur even in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.

properties than those of either single metallic sys-
tem [1–5]. Our group has recently performed theo-
retical calculations [6–8] and experimental studies
[9–12] of the unique chemical properties of the
Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have dem-
onstrated that at approximately one monolayer
(ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-
most layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the inter-
action with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of
the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the
Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorp-
tion energy of hydrogen and oleﬁn on the ML
Ni/Pt(111) surface. The coexistence of weakly ad-
sorbed hydrogen and oleﬁn can potentially result
in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways. For
example, using cyclohexene as a probe molecule
on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface [9–11], we observed
a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway to pro-
duce cyclohexane that was not present on either
Pt(111) or Ni(111) [13,14] under ultrahigh vac-
uum (UHV) conditions.
The objective of the current paper is to compare
the eﬀects of hydrocarbon structure and chain
length
on
the
low-temperature
hydrogenation
activity of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces using
several probe molecules, 1-hexene, benzene, and
1-butene. Temperature Programmed Desorption
(TPD) has been utilized to investigate the hydroge-
nation pathways both with and without the pres-
ence of pre-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. We will
compare the self-hydrogenation and hydrogena-
tion of 1-hexene to those of cyclohexene to deter-
mine the eﬀect of the hydrocarbon structure on
the activity and selectivity of the hydrogenation
pathways. We will also report the absence of
hydrogenation
activity
toward
benzene
under
similar UHV conditions to further highlight the
importance of hydrocarbon structure. In addition,
we will compare the hydrogenation of 1-butene
with 1-hexene to determine the eﬀect of hydrocar-
bon chain length on the hydrogenation activity.
The reactions of linear and cyclic oleﬁn mole-
cules on single crystal surfaces of Pt and Ni have
been the subject of many previous studies [15–
18]. Here we will only mention several studies that
are relevant to the current work. Ilharco et al.
studied the thermal decomposition of 1-hexene
by
reﬂection–absorption
infrared
spectroscopy
(RAIRS) on Pt(111) where the formation of
metallocycles occurs during the decomposition of
1-hexene at relatively high exposures. Two inter-
mediate metallocycles were identiﬁed by vibra-
tional spectroscopy, Pt3@C–(CH2)5–Pt at 270 K
and Pt3@C–(CH2)4–C@Pt3 at 370 K [19]. These
intermediate metallocycles could be the precursors
of cyclic hydrocarbons as it was shown by Tjandra
and Zaera on the studies of cyclization reactions
on Ni (100) [20].
The desorption of 1-butene and its isomers was
previously studied on Pt(111) and on ordered Sn/
Pt(111) surface alloys by Tsai and Koel. They
found that the chemisorption strength is related
to the number of Pt threefold sites, which de-
creases with increasing concentrations of Sn on
the surface. The hydrogenation of 1-butene to bu-
tane was not observed on the Sn/Pt(111) surfaces.
The main eﬀect of Sn modiﬁcation is the reduction
of the decomposition of molecular 1-butene, which
practically does not occur on the (p3 · p3)R30
Sn/Pt(111) surface [21].
2. Experimental
The TPD experiments were carried out in a
two-level stainless steel ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV)
chamber with a base pressure less than 2 ·
1010 Torr [9]. The UHV chamber is equipped
with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES), low-
energy electron diﬀraction optics (LEED), and a
quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTi). A tempera-
ture programmer was used to heat Pt(111) single
crystal at a linear rate of 3 K/s during the TPD
experiments. The crystal surface was placed at a
distance of 5 mm from the opening of a random
ﬂux shield of the mass spectrometer. Up to 10
masses were monitored simultaneously.
The Pt(111) single crystal (Metal Crystals and
Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), 1.5-mm-thick disk and
12 mm in diameter, was spot welded directly to
two tantalum spots that served as both electrical
connections for resistive heating and thermal con-
tacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. Using this
conﬁguration the temperature of the crystal could
be cooled to 90 K and heated up to 1100 K. The
Pt(111) single crystal was cleaned by cycles of
28

sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K, oxygen dosing
(1 · 108 Torr) at 890 K, and annealing at 1100 K.
Cyclohexene (c-C6H10), 1-hexene (C6H12) (Al-
drich, 99+%), n-hexane (C6H14) (Alfa Aesar,
97+%) and benzene (C6H6) were puriﬁed by con-
secutive freeze–pump–thaw cycles prior their use.
Hydrogen, 1-butene, neon, and oxygen were all
of research grade purity (99.999%) and were intro-
duced into the UHV chamber without further
puriﬁcation. The purity of all chemicals was veri-
ﬁed in-situ by mass spectrometry prior to use.
Doses are reported in Langmuir (1 Langmuir
(L) = 1 · 106 Torr s) and are not corrected for
ion gauge sensitivities.
Cyclohexene, benzene, n-hexane, 1-hexene, and
1-butene were dosed by backﬁlling the chamber
through a leak valve with a crystal temperature
below 120 K. Hydrogen and oxygen dosing was
carried out through directional dosing tubes, with
a diameter of 8 mm. For hydrogen dosing, a small
exposure (0.5 L) results in 40–50% saturation
coverage of hydrogen.
Ni was deposited from an evaporative doser on
the Pt(111) surface with a crystal temperature of
600 K to prevent CO adsorption from the UHV
background. The evaporative doser consists of a
Ni wire (99.999%) wrapped around a resistively
heated tungsten wire, which is contained in a stain-
less steel enclosure with an opening of 1 cm in
diameter. During deposition, the UHV pressure
was maintained below 5 · 1010 Torr. The purity
of the Ni layer was veriﬁed using AES, which
did not show detectable amount of carbon, oxygen
or other impurities. The coverage of Ni on Pt(111)
was estimated by monitoring the Ni(LMM)/Pt
(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio after deposition,
as described previously [9].
3. Results
3.1. Reaction pathways of 1-hexene on the
Ni/Pt(111) surfaces
On Pt(111), 1-hexene undergoes dehydrogena-
tion, self-hydrogenation, dehydro-cyclization, and
decomposition. Fig. 1 shows the desorption of
1-hexene
(C6H12,
84 amu),
benzene
(C6H6,
78 amu), hexane (C6H14, 86 amu), and hydrogen
(H2, 2 amu), as a function of 1-hexene exposure
on Pt(111). At an exposure of 0.5 L, the decompo-
sition of 1-hexene to produce hydrogen is the dom-
inant pathway. The main desorption product is
hydrogen with a broad peak at 325 K. At a higher
coverage of 1-hexene (3 L), self-hydrogenation to
produce hexane occurs at 275 K. At the same
exposure, molecular desorption of 1-hexene starts
to occur at 259 K (low intensity broad peak).
The raising tail at higher temperatures is from
the desorption of molecularly adsorbed 1-hexene
on the crystal support. Dehydro-cyclization to
produce benzene also occurs, as indicated by the
two benzene desorption peaks at 390 and 435 K.
The TPD spectrum of H2 at this exposure shows
two peaks, centered at approximately 280 and
397 K. Further exposure to 5 L shows the onset
of a multilayer desorption peak of 1-hexene at
120 K with the
monolayer peak
centered
at
259 K. A signiﬁcantly higher amount of hexane
is produced at 275 K. The desorption of benzene
occurs at 435 K with a lower intensity peak cen-
tered at 373 K. Finally, the H2 TPD spectrum
shows an additional higher temperature desorp-
tion peak at 624 K, possibly from further decom-
position of hydrocarbon fragments on the surface.
The desorption of 1-hexene, hexadiene (67
amu), benzene, and hexane after the exposure of
3 L of 1-hexene on diﬀerent Ni/Pt(111) surfaces
is shown in Fig. 2. The reaction pathways on Ni/
Pt(111) surfaces, with a Ni coverage of 0.5, 1.0
and 2.5 ML, are compared to those of clean
Pt(111) and a Ni ﬁlm which is designated as
>3 ML Ni/Pt(111). The latter surface shows very
weak AES Pt peaks due to the screening by the
Ni overlayer, and the Ni ﬁlm is epitaxially grown
as indicated by a sharp (111) LEED pattern [9].
On the 0.5 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, the desorption
of 1-hexene starts as a broad peak centered at
254 K, which shifts to a slightly lower temperature
sharp peak on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, and
ﬁnally broadens on the surfaces with higher Ni
coverages. Fig. 2 also shows the desorption of
mass 67 amu, which is the main cracking pattern
of hexadiene. Mass 67 amu is also a minor crack-
ing pattern of 1-hexene. As compared in Fig. 2,
the peak shape and desorption temperatures of

the mass 67 amu peaks are nearly identical to
those of mass 84 amu from the corresponding sur-
faces, suggesting that the origin of mass 67 amu
peak is from the cracking pattern of molecularly
desorbed 1-hexene. To further conﬁrm this we
have compared the intensity ratios of the mass
84 amu and mass 67 amu for the desorption peak
at 254 K. The intensity ratios are approximately
3.8 from all surfaces, which is identical to the ratio
from the mass spectrometry analysis of pure 1-hex-
ene in our UHV system. Thus the TPD results in
Fig. 2 indicate that the amount of hexadiene prod-
uct is negligible from the Pt(111), ML Ni/Pt(111)
and thick Ni surfaces. The only noticeable diﬀer-
ence is the presence of a relatively weak mass
67 amu peak at 374 K, which is from the desorp-
tion of hexadiene due to the lack of mass 84 amu
at the same temperature. The production of ben-
zene from Pt(111) leads to two desorption peaks
at 390 and 435 K. A single desorption peak at
401 K appears on the 0.5 ML Ni surface. The ben-
zene desorption peak broadens at the 1 ML Ni
coverage, where the maximum benzene production
occurs on the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. At higher Ni
coverages the benzene desorption peak decreases
in intensity, appearing as a broad peak centered

at a slightly higher temperature. Lastly, the pro-
duction of hexane shifts from 275 K on clean
Pt(111) surface to 247 K on the Ni/Pt surfaces
with 0.5 and 1 ML Ni. On Ni/Pt(111) surfaces
with Ni coverage above 1 ML, the hexane desorp-
tion shows a broader, less intense feature centered
at 247 K.
The unique chemistry of the 0.5 and 1.0 ML Ni/
Pt(111) surfaces is further conﬁrmed by the
desorption of the H2 product from the reaction
of 1-hexene. Fig. 3 shows the TPD spectra of H2
after exposure of 3 L of 1-hexene on diﬀerent Ni/
Pt(111) surfaces. By increasing the Ni coverage,
the 280 K peak on the clean Pt(111) surface
shifts to a lower temperature at 251 K. The two
peaks broaden at a coverage of 1 ML Ni. At cov-
erages above 2 ML Ni, the hydrogen desorbs as
one sharp peak at 316 K on 2.5 ML Ni/Pt(111)
and at 330 K on the Ni ﬁlm.
In order to quantify the peak areas of the hex-
ane product, we have performed TPD measure-
ments following the adsorption of n-hexane on
the Pt(111) and 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, as
shown in Fig. 4. After exposing the surfaces to

3 L of n-hexane, the desorption of molecular hex-
ane occurs from both surfaces as a relatively sharp
peak at 247 K. The 247 K peaks at 84 and 78 amu
are from the cracking patterns of molecularly des-
orbed n-hexane. The decomposition of n-hexane
occurs on both surfaces, as indicated by the detec-
tion of the H2 product. As will be described in Sec-
tion 4, the peak areas of n-hexane, together with
AES measurements at 100 and 800 K, allow us
to quantify the hexane yield from the reaction of
1-hexene.
3.2. Coadsorption of H2 and 1-hexene on the
monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface
The eﬀect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the 1-
hexene surface reaction pathways was studied.
For these TPD experiments, the same masses dis-
cussed in the previous section were monitored.
Fig. 5 shows the TPD spectra of 1-hexene, ben-
zene, hexane, and hydrogen, obtained after the
adsorption of 3 L of 1-hexene on the monolayer
Ni/Pt(111), with and without the presence of
pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The 0.5 L H2 exposure
on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface corresponds to
approximately 40–50% of saturation coverage
based on TPD measurements as a function of H2
exposure (spectra not shown). The results in
Fig. 5 show that molecular desorption of 1-hexene
occurs at approximately 194, 247, and 303 K from
the pre-adsorbed hydrogen experiment on the
1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. Although the presence
of the 0.5 L pre-adsorbed hydrogen does not
change the peak shape and intensity of the main
benzene desorption peak at 401 K, it appears to
cause a slight increase in the low-temperature ben-
zene desorption peak at 322 K. The most signiﬁ-
cant change in the TPD spectra is observed in
the production of hexane. The hexane production
is enhanced by a factor of 5.5, based on the TPD
peak areas with and without the presence of coad-
sorbed H2. The presence of 0.5 L pre-adsorbed
hydrogen not only enhances the production of
hexane at 242 K, but also induces a lower temper-
ature desorption peak at 200 K. More about the
quantiﬁcation of the activity and selectivity on
these surfaces will be provided in Section 4.
3.3. Eﬀect of hydrocarbon chain length
In order to determine the eﬀect of the hydrocar-
bon chain length on the hydrogenation of linear
alkenes, the reaction of 1-butene was also studied
on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. The desorption
of 1-butene (C4H8, 56 amu), 1,3-butadiene (C4H6,
54 amu), butane (C4H10, 58 amu), and hydrogen
(H2, 2 amu), after the adsorption of 3 L of 1-butene
both with and without the pre-adsorption of
hydrogen
on
the
1 ML
Ni/Pt(111)
surface,
is shown in Fig. 6. The desorption of 1-butene is
characterized
by
a
broad
peak
centered
at
206 K. When hydrogen is pre-adsorbed, the
desorption of 1-butene occurs from both mono-
layer (206 K) and multilayer (135 K). The desorp-
tion of 1,3-butadiene (54 amu) occurs in the same
pattern shown by the desorption of 1-butene, sug-
gesting that the main contribution to the mass
54 amu peak is due to 1-butene cracking. The
production of butane is negligible on the Pt(111)
surface with a very weak peak at 269 K, which is
consistent with earlier studies of 1-butene on
Pt(111) by Tsai and Koel [21] (not shown). In the
absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, only negligible
amount of butane desorbs from the ML Ni/
Pt(111) surface at 177 K. This observation

indicates that, unlike the reaction of 1-hexene, 1-
butene does not undergo the self-hydrogenation
pathway on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. When
hydrogen is pre-dosed on the Ni/Pt(111) surface,
the production of butane is increased signiﬁcantly
based on peak area. The comparison in Fig. 6 indi-
cates that the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface does not
hydrogenate 1-butene until pre-adsorbed hydrogen
is present on the surface. Lastly, hydrogen desorbs
at 300 and 345 K from the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface
from decomposition of 1-butene on ML Ni/
Pt(111). In the presence of pre-adsorbed H2, one
additional desorption peak is observed at 243 K.
3.4. Eﬀect of hydrocarbon structure
The eﬀect of molecular structure in the hydroge-
nation activity is addressed by comparing with the
hydrogenation pathways of two other C6 mole-
cules, cyclohexene and benzene. The self-hydroge-
nation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/
Pt(111) have been investigated in detail using
TPD and other surface spectroscopies [7,11]. For
the purpose of comparison Fig. 7 summarizes the
TPD spectra obtained following the reaction of
3 L
cyclohexene

and
without

adsorbed hydrogen on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111)

surface. In these experiments, cyclohexene (c-C6H10,
82 amu), benzene (C6H6, 78 amu), cyclohexane
(c-C6H12, 84 amu), and hydrogen (H2, 2 amu) were
monitored under identical conditions as those de-
scribed for 1-hexene. The hydrogenation product,
cyclohexane, is observed both with and without
pre-adsorbed hydrogen at temperatures ranging
from 200 to 240 K. Pre-adsorption of hydrogen
with cyclohexene increases the yield of cyclohex-
ane approximately threefold on the 1 ML Ni/
Pt(111) surface. Additionally, the onset of cyclo-
hexane desorption occurs at a temperature lower
than without the pre-adsorption of hydrogen, with
a shoulder in the cyclohexane spectra occurring at
200 K.
For completeness, we have also investigated the
potential
hydrogenation
of
benzene
on
Ni/
Pt(111). Fig. 8 compares the TPD spectra ob-
tained following the coadsorption of benzene and
hydrogen on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface at
100 K. Several possible hydrogenation products
were monitored, including cyclohexene (c-C6H10,
82 amu)
and
cyclohexane
(c-C6H12,
84 amu).
The only desorption products are benzene and
H2 from the Ni/Pt(111) surface pre-adsorbed
with hydrogen, indicating that benzene hydroge-

of surface hydrogen decreases the desorption tem-
perature of benzene but does not promote any
hydrogenation reaction. The absence of desorp-
tion of any hydrogenation products in the TPD

indicate
that,

The activity and selectivity of 1-hexene on the

Quantiﬁcation of the selectivity toward decom-
position (Eqs. (1) and (4)), dehydro-cyclization
(Eqs. (2) and (5)), and self-hydrogenation (Eqs.
(3) and (6)) were estimated on the diﬀerent sur-
faces based on TPD peak area ratios for the
products and AES measurements. The partial
dehydrogenation pathway toward hexadiene was
considered negligible for the method used in
this paper due to the very small peak areas
(Fig. 2). The activity toward complete decomposi-
tion on the clean Pt(111) surface was determined
using
AES
after
the
TPD
measurements
at
800 K. The surface coverage of atomic C was esti-
mated based on the C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES
ratio. As described below, the calculations took
into consideration of the following two eﬀects:
(1) the screening of the Pt AES signal by the sur-
face carbon atoms and (2) the contribution of
the Pt (241 eV) signal from Pt layers in the bulk.
The following parameters were deﬁned in the
calculation:
I
C: intensity of C (275 eV) feature for 1 ML C,
I
Pt: intensity of Pt (241 eV) feature for 1 ML Pt,
IC: AES intensity of C (275 eV) for C/Pt(111),
IPt: AES intensity of Pt (241 eV) for C/Pt(111).

The AES intensities of C (275 eV) for 1 ML car-
bon and Pt (241 eV) for 1 ML Pt are related by the
Auger sensitivity factors as follows:
I
C=SC ¼ I
Pt=SPt
ð7Þ
where SC and SPt are the sensitivity factors, which
are 0.6143 and 0.1575 [22], respectively, at an inci-
dence energy of 3 keV [23]. The experimentally
measured AES intensity of the C(KLL) feature
at 275 eV, IC, can be expressed as
IC ¼ xI
C
ð8Þ
where x is the fraction of monolayer of carbon
residing on top of the Pt(111) surface. The exper-
imentally measured AES
intensity of the Pt
(241 eV) feature is contributed from many layers
of Pt. The intensity from the ﬁrst layer of Pt can
be expressed as
First layer Pt :
I1
Pt ¼ ð1  xÞI
Pt þ xI

ð9Þ
The ﬁrst term represents the region without sur-
face carbon, and the second term is from the sur-
face region where Pt atoms are screened by the
surface carbon layer with a thickness of dC. The
term kPt is the mean free path of the Pt (241 eV)
electrons, which can be estimated to be 6.4 A
˚ from
the universal curve [22]. Similarly the Pt AES sig-
nal from the subsequent layers of Pt can be de-
scribed by the following general equation:
nth layer Pt :

Finally, the experimentally measured AES ratio of
the C(KLL)/Pt (241 eV) features can be related to
the surface carbon coverage, x, using the following
relationship:

In the current study we used the diameter of a
carbon atom (DC = 1.84 A
˚ [24]) for the thickness
of the surface carbon layer. The thickness of each
Pt layer was determined to be dPt = (p3/2)DPt
based on the geometric arrangement of the face
centered cubic (FCC) structure, with DPt being
the diameter of a Pt atom of 2.78 A
˚ [24]. Our cal-
culation also revealed that contributions to the Pt
AES signal from Pt atoms 20 layers or deeper were
negligible. For this reason the sum of the AES Pt
(241 eV) signal, IPt, was calculated from the ﬁrst
20 Pt layers. Using the experimental AES ratio
(IC/IPt) of 0.846 after the TPD measurement, cal-
culations using the above equations resulted in a
value of 0.575 carbon atom per surface Pt atom
following the decomposition of 1-hexene on clean
Pt(111), which corresponded to a value of 0.096

in Eq. (14)

In order to calculate the activity toward the
production of hexane, AES measurements were
performed at 100 K and after TPD of the 3 L hex-
ane-dosed Pt(111) surfaces (Fig. 4). The AES
measurement at 100 K (before TPD) was mea-
sured on an identical 3 L hexane-dosed Pt(111)
surface to avoid electron beam induced chemistry.
The AES C/Pt ratio before and after TPD was
0.363 and 0.105, respectively. Using the equa-
tions described above, these ratios corresponded
to a surface atomic C/Pt ratio of 0.247 and
0.072, respectively. The atomic C/Pt ratios before
and after TPD were used to correlate the TPD
peak area of molecularly desorbed hexane as
follows:

The activity toward self-hydrogenation, value c,
was calculated using Eq. (16) to be 0.0016 mole-
cule/Pt atom. To calculate the activity toward
dehydro-cyclization on the clean Pt(111) surface,
a ratio of the TPD peak area of benzene with the
TPD peak area of hexane was used as shown
below
Benzene Area from 1  Hexene TPD  0.061
Hexane Area from 1  Hexene TPD
¼ b
c
ð17Þ
where 0.061 was the mass spectrometer intensity
ratio between mass 84 amu of hexane and mass
78 amu of benzene. This ratio was obtained by
exposing the chamber to equal pressures of hexane
(6.6 · 108 Torr) and benzene (5.9 · 108 Torr)
based on their ion gauge sensitivities. Hence, the
value of b from Eq. (17) was 0.0004 molecule/Pt
atom. The error bars for values of a, b, and c were
typically within 10% based on multiple sets of AES
and TPD measurements. These values are summa-
rized in Table 1.
The activity calculations of 1-hexene on the
1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface were similar to those
carried out for the clean Pt(111) surface. The activ-
ity toward decomposition was calculated using the
C/Pt AES ratio after the TPD measurement of 3 L
1-hexene on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The
only diﬀerence was that the second layer was Ni
instead of Pt, and the thickness of the Ni layer
was dNi = (p3/2)DNi, with DNi being the diameter
of a Ni atom of 2.50 A
˚ [24]. Using the experimental
AES ratio (IC/IPt) of 0.374 after the TPD measure-
ment, the decomposition of 1-hexene on the
1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface was calculated to be
0.256 surface carbon atoms per surface Pt atom,
which corresponded to a value of 0.043 1-hexene
per surface Pt atom (Eq. (18))

Finally, the activities for the decomposition,
dehydro-cyclization, and hydrogenation pathways
were estimated when hydrogen is pre-adsorbed on
the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, using identical ap-
proaches described above. These activities are re-
ported in Table 1 along with the values in the
absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The estimated
selectivities for decomposition, dehydro-cycliza-
tion, and hydrogenation are also reported in Table
1.
One
of
the
most
important
observations
from Table 1 and Fig. 5 is that the presence of
pre-adsorbed hydrogen signiﬁcantly enhances the
hydrogenation
pathway
on
the
1 ML
Ni/
Pt(111) surface, leading to a factor of 5.5 increase
in the hexane yield, as well as a reduction in the
desorption temperature of hexane to approxi-
mately 200 K.

In addition, as compared in Fig. 2, the maxi-
mum production of hexane due to self-hydrogena-
tion of 1-hexene is obtained on the 1 ML Ni/Pt
surface. This is consistent with our previous stud-
ies of the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene on
Ni/Pt(111) surfaces with diﬀerent Ni coverages
[6,10,11]. As described from previous experimental
measurements and DFT modeling for the self-
hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the surface sites
responsible for the low-temperature self-hydroge-
nation are most likely surface Pt atoms that are
modiﬁed by subsurface Ni atoms. The number of
such surface sites would reach a maximum at a
monolayer Ni coverage. At coverages greater than
1 ML, Ni atoms start to occupy the surface sites
instead of diﬀusing into the subsurface region,
gradually converting the surface chemistry of Ni/
Pt(111) to that of Ni at higher Ni coverages.
The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclo-
hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been
attributed to the presence of weakly bonded
hydrogen
and
weakly
p-bonded
cyclohexene
[6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene
on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been deter-
mined to occur by the weakly p-bonded conﬁgura-
tion
[11],
which
is
diﬀerent
from
the
di-r
chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or
Ni(111). Using a similar argument, the observa-
tion of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-
hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and
ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the
p-bonded conﬁguration, which reacts with weakly
adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane. Additional
studies using high-resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy (HREELS) would be necessary to
conﬁrm this.
It is also interesting to notice that the desorp-
tion of hexane, from the self-hydrogenation of
1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111), occurs at 247 K
(Fig. 2), which is identical to the desorption of
molecularly adsorbed hexane from the same sur-
face (Fig. 4). The identical desorption temperature
suggests that the production of gas-phase hexane
from 1-hexene might be a desorption-limited pro-
cess. However, HREELS studies are necessary to
determine whether hexane was produced on the
surface before desorption.
4.2. Eﬀect of molecular structure
In order to determine the eﬀect of hydrocarbon
structure on the hydrogenation, Table 2 compares
the selectivity of the hydrogenation products from
the reactions of 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the
ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, both with and without
the
presence
of
pre-adsorbed
hydrogen.
The
desorption temperatures of the two products are
very similar, at 247 K for hexane (Fig. 2) and at
230 K for cyclohexane (Fig. 7). In addition, the
presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the
yields of both hexane and cyclohexane, although
the degree of enhancement is higher for hexene
(a factor of 5.5) than for cyclohexane (a factor
of 3).
As shown in Table 2, the main diﬀerence in the
reaction pathways of 1-hexene and cyclohexene on
the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) is that the selectivity to
dehydrogenation is much higher for cyclohexene
than for 1-hexene, both in the presence and ab-
sence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, most likely due
to the presence of the C6 ring structure in cyclo-
hexene. Furthermore, as expected, the dehydroge-
nation to benzene is an irreversible reaction under
UHV conditions, as conﬁrmed by the absence of
any hydrogenation activity toward benzene on
the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface (Fig. 8).

4.3. Eﬀect of hydrocarbon chain length
The chain length of alkene appears to have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the self-hydrogenation and
hydrogenation pathways, as indicated by the
TPD results of 1-butene as compared to those of
1-hexene or cyclohexene. The most signiﬁcant dif-
ference is the near absence of the self-hydrogena-
tion pathway in 1-butene (Fig. 5). One possible
explanation is that the desorption of 1-butene oc-
curs at a lower temperature, 206 K (Fig. 6) than
that of either 1-hexene (247 K) or cyclohexene
(227 K) from the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. It is
well established that the desorption temperature
of alkenes depends on the chain length (or molec-
ular weight) and molecular structure [12–14]. The
reduction in the desorption temperature from
247 K for 1-hexene to 206 K for 1-butene is
consistent with the reduction of two CH2 groups
in molecular weight [25].
In order to correlate the self-hydrogenation
activity with the desorption temperature of alkene,
we assume that molecularly adsorbed alkene can
either undergo reversible molecular desorption or
produce strongly chemisorbed surface species,
with the latter not participating in the hydrogena-
tion reaction. This assumption is consistent with
previous observations that the hydrogenation oc-
curs only for weakly p-bonded alkenes [26]. In
the self-hydrogenation reaction the ﬁrst step in-
volves the dehydrogenation of alkene to produce
atomic hydrogen. This in turn requires that the
dehydrogenation temperature should be the same
or lower than the desorption temperature of
weakly bonded alkenes that undergo reversible
molecular desorption. This requirement appears
to be met in the case of 1-hexene and cyclohexene,
as conﬁrmed by the observation that the desorp-
tion temperature of the self-hydrogenation prod-
uct
is
similar
to
that
of
the
corresponding
molecularly desorbed alkene, at 247 K for 1-hex-
ene and hexane (Fig. 5) and at 227–230 K for
cyclohexene and cyclohexane (Fig. 7).
In comparison, the absence of the self-hydroge-
nation pathway in 1-butene suggests that the dehy-
drogenation
temperature
to
produce
atomic
hydrogen is most likely higher than the desorption
temperature of 1-butene at 206 K. Although 1,3-
butadiene is detected in the TPD measurements
(Fig. 6), the identical peak shape and desorption
temperature to that of 1-butene suggest that these
peaks are due to the cracking of 1-butene instead
of the dehydrogenation product. Because the ini-
tial dehydrogenation of 1-alkenes would most
likely occur at the C–H bonds of the C@C moiety,
one would expect the dehydrogenation tempera-
ture to be similar for 1-alkenes such as 1-butene
and 1-hexene. It would be very informative to
investigate whether and/or at what temperature
the self-hydrogenation of 1-pentene occurs on the
ML Ni/Pt(111) surface.
It is important to point out that despite the ab-
sence of the self-hydrogenation pathway, the
hydrogenation of 1-butene occurs readily on the
ML Ni/Pt(111) surface in the presence of pre-ad-
sorbed hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 6, the desorp-
tion of the hydrogenation product, butane, occurs
as a sharp peak at 177 K. This is lower than the
desorption temperatures of hexane at 200 K and
242 K (Fig. 5) and of cyclohexane at 225 K
(Fig. 7). The lower desorption temperature of the
C4 product as compared to the C6 products is
again most likely due to the diﬀerence in the
hydrocarbon chain length.
5. Conclusions
Based on the results described above, the follow-
ing conclusions can be made regarding the hydro-
genation pathways of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces:
(1) A low-temperature self-hydrogenation path-
way is observed at 247 K in the reaction of
1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. In
addition, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydro-
genation to produce trace amount of hexadi-
ene, dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene,
and complete decomposition to produce
atomic carbon and hydrogen. The presence
of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface
increases the production of hexane by a fac-
tor of 5.5, while causing little change in the
other reaction pathways.
(2) The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-
hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar

41
self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/
Pt(111) surface. The main diﬀerence is the
much higher dehydrogenation activity in
cyclohexene to produce benzene. In addition,
the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur
on Ni/Pt(111) under UHV conditions.
(3) The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6
alkenes indicates that the chain length (or
molecular weight) has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the self-hydrogenation activity. The self-
hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene
on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the
relatively low desorption temperature of
molecularly adsorbed 1-butene. On the other
hand, the hydrogenation of 1-butene occurs
readily in the
presence
of pre-adsorbed
hydrogen, although the desorption tempera-
ture of the butane product is signiﬁcantly
lower than that of hexane and cyclohexane.
