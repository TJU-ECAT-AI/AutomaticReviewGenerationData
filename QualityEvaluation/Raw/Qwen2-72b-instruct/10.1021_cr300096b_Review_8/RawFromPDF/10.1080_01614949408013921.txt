INTRODUCTION 
High aromatic content in diesel fuel has been recognized both to lower 
the fuel quality and to contribute significantly to the formation of undesired 
emissions in exhaust gases [l, 
21. Because of the health hazards associated 
with these emissions, environmental regulations governing the composition 
of diesel fuels are being tightened in both Europe and the United States, 
leading to limitations on aromatics [3, 41. 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has passed legislative 
measures that limit the sulfur and aromatic content of motor vehicle diesel 
fuel to O.O5%(w) and IO%(v), respectively, effective October 1, 1993. A 
recent version of an administration-sponsored bill supports this ruling and 
would prohibit the sale of motor vehicle diesel fuel with >0.05 wt% sulfur 
and a capped aromatic standard defined as 35%(v) aromatics or a cetane 
index of more than 40 IS]. In Europe, Sweden has already tightened the 
aromatics specifications, requiring not more than 5%(v) aromatics for class 
1 diesel fuel, and other countries in the region are considering measures to 
limit the aromatic content or stipulation of a minimum cetane index. 
As a result of the stringent environmental regulations, processes for 
aromatic reduction in middle distillates have received considerable attention 
in recent years. Studies have shown that existing middle distillate hydro- 
treaters designed to reduce sulfur and nitrogen levels would lower the diesel 
aromatics only marginally [6-81. 
At present, conventional hydrotreating technology is adapted for ar- 
omatic saturation and it has been recognized that aromatic hydrogenation 
(AH) is more difficult than hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitro- 
genation (HDN) under conditions that are normally used for hydrotreating. 
[n addition to this, there are thermodynamic equilibrium limitations on 
aromatic hydrogenation within the normal operating range of hydrorefining. 
A clear understanding of the effects of process variables, catalyst type, and 
the interaction of these variables on chemistry and thermodynamic equilib- 
ria of different types of aromatic compounds present in the feedstock is 
necessary for determination of the optimum operating strategies to handle 
the aromatics present in the diesel-blending streams. 
Despite the importance of AH in the refining industry, the subject has 
not received much attention. Compared with the extensive literature on 
HDS [9-121, HDN [13-161, and hydrometallation (HDM) [17-191 pro-

cesses, the number of publications on aromatic hydrogenation is relatively 
small, although catalytic centers responsible for the hydrogenation in hy- 
drotreating catalysts have received some attention in HDS and HDN lit- 
erature. Particularly, comprehensive reviews on aromatic hydrogenation 
covering varous aspects of the AH processes are scarce. 
The purpose of this paper is to review the work reported in the lit- 
erature on both basic and industrial aspects of aromatic hydrogenation. 
Fundamental studies concerning the kinetic, mechanistic, thermodynamic, 
and catalytic chemistry aspects of aromatic hydrogenation reactions have 
been examined, and recent scientific literature on the nature of hydrogen- 
ation and hydrogenolysis sites is discussed. Particular emphasis is given to 
recent developments in catalysts and processing technologies for reduction 
of aromatics to acceptably low levels in diesel fuels in the light of stringent 
environmental regulations.

TYPES OF AROMATIC COMPOUNDS IN 
PETROLEUM FRACTIONS 
Detailed analyses by several techniques [20-261 such as high-pressure 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), 13C 
nuclear magnetic resonance (I3CNMR), 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and by ultraviolet (UV) and in- 
frared (IR) techniques have shown that the aromatics found in petroleum 
and synthetic middle distillates mainly fall into four groups: (i) monoaro- 
matics, (ii) diaromatics, (iii) triaromatics, and (iv) polycyclic aromatics. 
Among these, the polycyclic aromatics with four or more condensed ben-

Lene rings are largely present in many high-boiling petroleum fractions (BP 
> 35OoC), whereas the other three types are important components of 
middle distillates. Typical analysis data (26) on the type of aromatic com- 
pounds present in untreated gas oil fractions of Kuwait petroleum are pre- 
sented in Table 1. 
It is seen that diaromatics (mainly alkyl naphthalenes) constitute a 
major portion of the total content of aromatics in straight-run gas oil. 
However, in hydrotreated oils, monoaromatics (e.g., alkyl benzenes, ben- 
zocycloparaffins, and benzodicycloparaffins) are present in larger quantities 
than di- and triaromatics (Table 2). 
Condensed multiring aromatic compounds are hydrogenated more eas- 
ily to the corresponding monoaromatics under mild hydrotreating condi- 
tions. This point is discussed in more detail in the section on kinetics and 
thermodynamics. Typical structures of some mono-, di-, and triaromatic 
compounds found in middle distillate fractions are shown in Table 3. 
The amount and type of aromatics in middle distillates show large 
variations depending on the origin of the feedstock. Typical HPLC data on 
aromatic type distribution in gas oils from different 
sources are summarized 
in Table 4. 
It is seen that the aromatic content in light cycle oils (LCO) from fluid 
catalytic cracking (FCC) units is very high (about 70%). Straight-run gas 
oils contain relatively low amounts of aromatics. The front-end LCO con- 
tains virtually all the monoaromatics, whereas the back-end LCO contains 
predominantly di- and tri + -aromatics.

the partial 
pressure of hydrogen. In the derivation of this equation it is assumed that 
liquid activity coefficients and fugacities for A and AH are equal, and that 
the hydrogen activity coefficient and the ratio of fugacity to total pressure 
at hydrotreating conditions are both unity. 
It is seen that high pressures favor low equilibrium concentrations of 
aromatics (high conversions). This is particularly so for reactions where the 
number of moles of hydrogen, n, 
required for complete saturation is high. 
Aromatic hydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, with heats of 
reaction typically in the range 63-71 kJ/mole H2 [29,30]. K, decreases with

increased temperature, and thereby the equilibrium aromatics concentra- 
tion increases as the temperature is increased. 
Experimental data for the calculation of equilibrium constants are 
sparse [31-341. Group contribution methods have been applied by a number 
of workers in order to be able to estimate equilibrium constants [35-371. 
As pointed out by Girgis and Gates [38], the uncertainties of these methods 
can result in more than an order of magnitude error in calculated K,. 
Calculated equilibrium constants indicate that there is considerable 
variation from one family of aromatic hydrocarbons to another. In the 
hydrogenation of benzene homologues (Fig. l), the value of the equilibrium 
constant decreases with an increase in both the number of side chains and 
the number of carbon atoms in each side chain [37,39]. The same is found 
for naphthalenes [28]. 
For aromatic hydrocarbons containing more than one ring, hydrogen- 
ation proceeds via successive steps, each of which is reversible. The equi-

librium constant is generally higher for the hydrogenation of the first ring 
(Fig. 2, Ref. 37), but since more moles of hydrogen are involved in the 
final ring hydrogenation (3 moles compared with 1 or 2 moles for hydro- 
genaton of the first ring in phenanthrene), hydrogenation of the first ring 
is usually less thermodynamically favored than hydrogenation of the final 
ring at typical hydrotreating conditions.

Ref. 28 have been used to calculate the equilibrium aromatic concentration

perature at three levels of hydrogen pressure. The equilibrium aromatic 
concentration for first-ring hydrogenation is higher than that for final-ring 
hydrogenation at temperatures below 375°C (648 K) at 3 MPa, and at 
temperatures up to 435°C (708 K) at 10 MPa. These curves also demonstrate 
the strong effect of hydrogen pressure on the equilibrium aromatic con- 
centration: At 350°C (623 K), the equilibrium concentration for the reaction 
naphthalene to tetralin decreases from 11.4% at 3 MPa to 1.2% at 10 MPa, 
while the equilibrium concentration decreases from 21.5% at 3 MPa to 
4.5% at 10 MPa for the reaction phenanthrene to tetrahydrophenanthrene. 
IV. KINETICS AND REACTION MECHANISMS 
Several types of aromatic compounds have been used as representative 
model compounds in the study of AH kinetics. These include benzene, 
toluene and alkyl benzenes, naphthalene, biphenyl, phenanthrene, pyrene, 
fluorene, and fluoranthene [38, 40-511. 
In most of the studies, particularly those involving large condensed 
ring aromatic compounds, the complex reaction network has been reported 
The various kinetic studies reported in the literature for different model 
aromatic compounds and real industrial feedstocks are reviewed in this 
section. Earlier work carried out on the subject (before 1980) is only briefly 
discussed in this review. Readers may refer to Kiperman [52] and to Weiser 
and Landa [53] for earlier work on the subject. 
[381. 
A. Kinetic Studies on Model Aromatic Compounds: Benzene and 
Alkyl Benzenes 
Hydrogenation kinetics of benzene have been studied extensively both 
on supported group VIII metal (e.g., Ni, Pd, Pt) and on metal sulfide (e.g., 
MoS,, WS2, Co-Mo-S/A1,03, Ni-Mo-S/A1203, 
and Ni-W-S/Al,O,) catalysts. 
A general reaction network for benzene hydrogenation over a sulfided Co- 
Mo/Al,03 catalyst is shown in Scheme 1 [44]. 
As is evident from Scheme 1, benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane 
and formation of methyl cyclopentane are consecutive reactions. Some workers 
[54] argue that hydrogenation to cyclohexane and hydroisomerization to 
methyl cyclopentane start from a common intermediate product, cyclo- 
hexane, as shown in Scheme 2.

STANISLAUS AND COOPER 
SCHEME 2 
SCHEME 3. Mechanism for the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of 
benzene over group VIII metals. 
While it is generally agreed in the hydrogenation of benzene over group 
VIII metal catalysts that the adsorbed state of benzene in active hydrogen- 
ation is associatively adsorbed, probably as a wcomplex, there is still con- 
siderable debate as to the nature of surface intermediates. Several workers 
[55-571 have proposed that benzene hydrogenation proceeds through 
cycloolefins 
. 
Van Meerten et al. [58] found evidence of three forms of chemisorption 
assigned to benzene on Ni-Si catalysts. A stepwise reaction mechanism has 
been proposed recently by Van der Steen, Scholten et al. [57,59] (Scheme 
3). The reaction intermediate, cyclohexene, has been observed to desorb 
before further hydrogenation. Desorption of the cyclohexadienes (C,H,) 
has never been observed. Apparently, these dienes are too strongly ad- 
sorbed to desorb before further hydrogenation. 
Aben et al. [60] 
proposed the following Langmuir-type kinetic equation 
for benzene hydrogenation on supported Pt, Pd, and Ni catalysts in a flow 
system: 
where b is the adsorption coefficient for molecular hydrogen, 0 
is the 
fraction of surface covered, and ko is the rate constant. The form of the 
kinetic expression implies that hydrogen is molecular adsorbed and that the 
hydrogenation reaction is zero-order in benzene. The activation energy was 
found to be nearly the same (about 14 k 1 
kcallmole) for the three catalysts. 
While many studies confirm that the reaction is zero-order in benzene [61],

85 
others report [62] that the reaction order increases from the low value 0.5 
at 25°C to 2-3 at 200°C. 
Recently, Chou and Vannice [40,41] examined the kinetics of benzene 
hydrogenation on supported Pd catalysts under a wide range of reaction 
conditions. At temperatures below 160"C, the apparent activation energies 
were found to be about 12.0 kcal/mole. The reaction order in hydrogen 
increased from 0.5 to nearly 4 as the temperature increased from 80°C to 
300"C, whereas the reaction order for benzene increased from 0 to 0.8 in 
the same temperature range. The hydrogenation activity of the catalyst 
showed a temperature-dependent maximum near 220"C, as reported by 
others [52]. Such a maximum is apparently not associated with the ther- 
modynamic equilibrium limitation, since the rate of the reverse reaction 
becomes considerable only at high temperatures. Chou and Vannice [40] 
attributed this behavior to the formation of hydrogen-deficient surface car- 
bonaceous species by dehydrogenation of benzene, which inhibits the prin- 
cipal hydrogenation reaction. 
They proposed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate expression in which 
benzene and hydrogen are assumed to be adsorbed on different sites and 
the reaction proceeds by stepwise addition of hydrogen to the benzene ring. 
Desorption of cyclohexane is assumed to be fast and irreversible. Rate terms 
for a concurrent equilibrated, dehydrogenation reaction sequence involving 
adsorbed benzene have also been included in the rate equation to account 
for changes in the number of 
active sites due to carbonaceous species formed 
under different reaction conditions. The complete rate expression is too 
complex to reproduce here. Readers may refer to the original paper [41] 
for further details. 
Earlier work by van Meerten and Coenen [63] on the kinetics of ben- 
zene hydrogenation using Ni-Si catalysts considered the relative rates in 
stepwise addition of hydrogen and concluded that the hydrogen addition 
steps all have the same rate. 
Very few kinetic and mechanistic data for the hydrogenation of toluene 
are available in the literature. Lepage [37] reported the first extensive stud- 
ies on the kinetics of toluene hydrogenation over sulfided Ni- 
W/A1,03 
catalysts. At low pressures (0-0.5 MPa), the reaction rate was found to 
increase linearly as a function o
f
 hydrogen and toluene partial pressures, 
indicating that the reaction has an apparent order of 1 
with respect to both 
hydrogen and toluene. The kinetic behavior of the reaction was represented 
by the following Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate equation: 
where k = rate constant; bA 
and bsi 
are adsorption coefficients .for aromatic 
and sulfur compounds; and PA, 
PHz, 
and Psi 
represent the partial pressures 
of the aromatic hydrocarbon, hydrogen, and sulfur compounds including 
H2S.

At higher pressures (above 0.4 MPa), however, the kinetic data ap-

by the above rate equation was observed (Fig. 4). 
The apparent energy of activation for toluene hydrogenation over 
sulfided Ni-W/AI2O3 
catalyst calculated from the kinetic data was 92 kJ/ 
mole. 
In another study from the same laboratory, Ahuja et al. [64] proposed 
the following rate equation for hydrogenation of toluene in the presence

with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism without competitive adsorption

aromatic compounds have , 
however, shown that competitive adsorption 
and inhibition by the product naphthenes are negligible [62].

these were intended to probe the relation between electronic structure and 
activity of the metal catalysts. 
The first extensive determination of kinetics of toluene hydrogenation 
on supported Pd catalysts over a wide range of conditions was reported 
very recently by Rahman and Vannice [42,43]. These authors also examined 
the effect of methyl substituents on the rate of hydrogenation of benzene 
rings by comparing the kinetic behavior of benzene, toluene, and xylenes. 
The kinetic data showed that all reactions were first-order in hydrogen 
and zero-order in aromatic compound concentration, indicating a near sat- 
uration coverage of the active sites by aromatic species. Activation energies 
were near those of benzene (50.2, 49.3, 50.2, 53.1, and 57.2 kJ/mole for 
benzene, toluene, rn-xylene, o-xylene and p-xylene, respectively). The use 
of highly acidic oxide supports (e.g., Si02-A1203, Ti02) was found to 
markedly enhance the hydrogenation rate. Furthermore, contrary to the 
case of benzene, there was no deactivation or significant coverages of hy- 
drogen deficient surface inhibitors. 
The following Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate equation involving 
two sets of active sites (one on the Pd surface and the other composed by 
acid sites in the Pd-support interfacial region with spilled-over hydrogen) 
was proposed to describe the hydrogenation kinetics of all these aromatic 
hydrocarbons. 
At high enough pressures of the aromatic compound this just becomes: 
This rate expression indicates that hydrogen and aromatic hydrocar- 
bons adsorb on different types of sites, and that the reaction occurs simul- 
taneously on Pd surface and on acid sites in the interface region. The 
aromatic species are adsorbed strongly, and near saturation exists at high 
enough partial pressures of aromatics so that KAPA >> 1 
and the reaction 
is zero-order in aromatic compound. 
These authors also observed that the hydrogenation rate depends on 
the number and position of methyl substituents in the order: 
Benzene > toluene > 
p-xylene 2 
rn-xylene > a-xylene 
which is in agreement with the results previously reported by others [52, 
69,701. However, a completely reverse order of reactivity has been reported 
for these hydrocarbons on sulfide catalysts such as Ni-W-S/A1203 
and Ni- 
Mo-S/A1203, 
as seen in Table 5. The reasons for the difference in the effect

of alkyl substituents on hydrogenation rate for metal and metal sulfide 
catalysts are not well understood. 
The bonding of a molecule on a surface depends on the local electron 
density of states on the adsorbing metal atoms. It is generally known that 
aromatic compounds such as benzene and toluene are bonded to the metal 
surface via n-bonds involving an electron transfer from the aromatic ring 
to the unoccupied d-metal orbitals [71, 73, 741. Since the n-electron cloud 
density in toluene is higher than that of benzene as a result of the inductive

effect of the methyl group, toluene is generally expected to be more strongly 
adsorbed than benzene. In confirmation of this, Gallezot and co-workers 
[75] observed that the ratio of adsorption coefficients of toluene and benzene 
(&I&) 
on group VIII metals is always higher than unity and increases 
with the electron-deficient nature of the metals. 
Based on these principles, Vannice and co-workers [42] argue that 
toluene has a greater stability on the catalyst surface than benzene and may 
hence undergo hydrogenation at a lower rate. 
Pd supported on strongly acidic supports is electron deficient [76-781, 
and as a result toluene would be expected to be more strongly adsorbed 
than benzene on the metal. In addition, a stronger interaction between 
toluene and the acidic site as compared with benzene could reduce the 
hydrogenation rate of the former. In support of this argument, the ratio of 
toluene to benzene hydrogenation rates has been found to be higher in the 
absence of acidic supports than in the presence of one [42]. 
Similarly, further increase in electron density with the addition of 
another methyl group may explain the lower reactivity o
f
 xylenes. However, 
it should be noted that o-xylene has the lowest reactivity among the xylenes. 
This has primarily been attributed to a steric effect. Steric hindrance of 
neighboring methyl groups in o-xylene could have a more significant effect 
on the formation of n-bonded complexes. 
For metal sulfide catalysts, as mentioned earlier, the reactivity pattern 
of benzene and alkyl benzenes is the opposite. In other words, addition of 
methyl groups to benzene nucleus enhances the reactivity of these molecules 
for hydrogenation. This behavior could be discussed on the basis of the 
work of Geneste and Moreau [79-811 on the hydrogenation of a series of 
substituted benzenes. Based on experimental results for hydrogenation and 
hydrogenolysis of a series of benzenes substituted by different electronega- 
tive groups such as NH2, NHC6Hs, OH, OC6H5, 
SH, SC6H5, 
C2H5, C6H5, 
and halogens over a sulfided Ni-Mo/A1203 
catalyst at 340°C and 7 MPa H2 
pressure, these authors proposed that the reactions of hydrogenation and 
hydrogenolysis are mostly influenced by the n-electron delocalization through 
resonance, hydrogenation being favored by highly electron-donating sub- 
stituents. Hydrogenation is easier when the ring to be hydrogenated is less 
aromatic [79]. 
These authors argue [80, 811 that electron-donating substituents in an 
aromatic compound can cause localization of the n-electron at a preferred 
position, leading to a diminution in the strength of the n-absorption and 
consequently higher reaction rates. This explanation is similar to the one 
advanced earlier by Nag [82]. According to Nag, aromatic double bonds, 
due to stabilization by resonance, are normally difficult to hydrogenate. 
However, when a wcomplex is formed, these double bonds are weakened 
by transfer of electrons from the bonding highest occupied molecular orbital 
(HOMO) to the antibonding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) 
of the reaction via the metal atom on the catalyst surface. The stronger the

Ir-complex bond, the weaker the double bonds become, and the more 
vulnerable they are to the attack by hydrogen. Therefore, any factor that 
strengthens the Ir-complex bond should augment hydrogenation. 
This explanation, however, contradicts the arguments of Vannice and 
co-workers [42], who claim that electron-donating substituents increase the 
density of the Ir-electron cloud, which in turn increases the bond strength 
between the metal and the aromatic compound and leads to a lower reac- 
tivity. 
It is possible that the mechanisms of adsorption on the two types of 
catalysts are entirely different so that the hydrogenation of the aromatic 
ring is enhanced in one type of catalyst (group VI metal sulfides) and 
suppressed on the other by the presence of electron-donating groups in the 
aromatic ring. Steric effects of the alkyl substituents should also be consid- 
ered. The question still remains to be solved and obviously more research 
is needed on this subject. 
B. Hydrogenaton of Di-, Tri-, and Polyaromatic Compounds 
Kinetics of hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons containing two or 
more rings are more complicated. Most kinetic studies on di- and multiring 
aromatic compounds reported in the literature deal mainly with the reaction 
pathways and reactivities rather than quantitative kinetic models that in- 
clude adsorption mechanism of reactants, intermediates, and products [38]. 
Spare and Gates [44] proposed reaction pathways for hydrogenation 
of naphthalene, biphenyl, and 2-phenyl naphthalene over a sulfided Co- 
Moly-AI,O, catalyst at 325°C and 75 atmospheres pressure (atm) (Scheme 
4
)
.
 
The reactions were approximately first-order in the aromatic reactant. 
The rate constants for various forward and reverse reactions are shown in 
the network. The rate data for benzene hydrogenation are also included in 
the network for the purpose of comparison. 
The rate data for various reactions in the network (Scheme 4
)
 
show 
that the rate of hydrogenation of naphthalene to tetralin is considerably 
(about 21 times) faster than that of benzene hydrogenation as reported by 
others [53]. Presence of phenyl substituents in benzene or naphthalene has 
no significant effect on the reactivity for hydrogenation of these aromatic 
hydrocarbons, in contrast to the effect of alkyl substituents, which enhance 
hydrogenation. The enhancement in reactivity resulting from the electro- 
donating influence of the aryl substituents is probably compensated for by 
increased steric hindrance of adsorption. 
Patzer et al. [83] studied the hydrogenation kinetics of 1-methyl 
naphthalene over a series of commercial coal liquefaction catalysts in the 
temperature range 343" to 482°C and found the reaction to obey first-order 
kinetics. These authors also noticed that the ratio of concentations of tetralin 
to naphthalene in the product remained almost constant at about 0.49 2 
0.03, being unaffected by changes in catalyst composition, feed flow rate,

in view of the lack of dependence on the ratio of 
tetralin to naphthalene on temperature. They pointed out that in the ex- 
periments reported by Patzer et al., the residence time (defined as reciprocal 
of hourly space velocity, LHSV-') was typically varied over a small range 
(0.3 to 0.6). Estimation of relative concentration profiles from kinetic pa- 
rameters showed that both naphthalene and tetralin concentrations are 
almost linearly dependent on residence time (LHSV- l) in this range (Fig. 
5), and consequently the naphthalene-to-tetralin ratio is almost constant, 
giving the incorrect impression of an equilibrium distribution. 
Spare and Gates [45] 
reported the first extensive determination o

proposed the following Langmuir-Hinshelwood form of equation to rep- 
resent the rate data for the reaction network shown in Scheme 4. 
where K(i) is the adsorption equilibrium constant for species (i). 
This rate expression accounts for the reversibility of the reaction and 
inhibition by H,S and reactants (H, and biphenyl). At high hydrogen partial 
pressures, the reaction is nearly first-order in hydrogen concentration. The 
Langmuir dependence of rate on biphenyl concentration suggests that 
saturation of the catalytic sites with biphenyl is approached at higher con- 
centrations. The effect of all the important process variables is predicted 
by this rate model and a good agreement between the observed and pre- 
dicted rates is observed, as shown in Fig. 6.

hydrocarbons such as fluorene, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene over sul- 
fided Ni-W/A1203 
catalysts are summarized in Figs. 7(a)-7(c). The results 
show that hydrogenation of these polynuclear aromatic compounds occurs 
ring by ring in a series fashion. The hydrogenation reactions were essentially 
found to be first-order in the aromatic hydrocarbon. No kinetic rate equa- 
tions were proposed for the above reactions. 
With polycondensed ring aromatic hydrocarbons, the first-ring hydro- 
genation has been observed to be most favored kinetically. The rates of 
hydrogenation of subsequent rings tend to become lower, and hydrogen- 
ation of the last ring proceeds with considerable difficulty compared with 
the initial hydrogenation steps. 
The relative rate constants for hydrogenation of the first ring of a few 
condensed di- and triaromatics such as naphthalene, anthracene, and phen- 
anthrene over different sulfide catalysts are presented in Table 6. The res- 
onance energies of various aromatic compounds are also included in the 
table. A comparison of the resonance energies indicates the following order 
of aromaticity: 
Benzene < naphthalene < anthracene < phenanthrene 
The partial resonance energy or aromaticity of the different rings in 
fused multiring aromatic systems may be different. Thus, for example, the 
resonance energy per ring in naphthalene molecules is considerably lower 
than that of benzene (Table 6). The low aromatic character of one of the 
rings in the naphthalene molecule is experimentally shown by its ability to 
undergo addition reactions across 1,2 positions. The middle ring of anthra- 
cene is more reactive, and it has been reported that it behaves just like a 
double bond. In multiring aromatic compounds, the ring with the lowest

C. Kinetic Studies on Industrial Feedstocks 
Literature information on kinetic studies of aromatic hydrogenation 
in industrial feedstocks such as petroleum and synthetic middle distillates 
is relatively scarce, probably due to the complexity of the reactions. Some 
authors [37] have proposed an overall kinetic order of 1 relative to the 
concentration of aromatic compounds taken as a whole. The reversible 
reaction was, however, not taken into account in this approach. The con- 
version of aromatics to naphthenes is a reversible reaction and involves a 
chemical equilibrium which is temperature dependent. Several studies [85 - 
871 have shown that the aromatic content of the product decreases with 
increasing reaction temperature , 
but then increases as the temperature is 
further raised; that is, the aromatic content passes through a minimum. 
Therefore, the rate of the reversible reaction and thermodynamic equilibria 
must be taken into account in deriving kinetic models for aromatics hydro- 
genation. 
Wilson and Kriz [88, 891 used the following equilibrium reaction as a 
basis for developing a model for kinetics of hydrogenation of aromatics in 
middle distillates: 
Aromatics + nH2 $ 
naphthenes 
By assuming that the forward reaction is pseudo-first-order (since hydro- 
genation is carried out in large hydrogen excess at constant partial pressure) 
and the reverse reaction is first-order in naphthene, the rate expression is 
given by: 
where: CA = fractional aromatics content (-); CN 
= fractional naphthene 
content (-); t = time, h; k, = forward rate constant, h-l MPa-l; k, = 
reverse rate constant, h-l; PH2 
= hydrogen partial pressure, MPa; and n 
= reaction order with respect to hydrogen partial pressure (-). 
On integration, and with suitable substitution, the following expression 
is derived: 
where CAo 
is the initial aromatics concentration, C,, is the equilibrium 
aromatics concentration, and kR 
is the hydrogenation rate constant = kF 
(1 + CAe/CNe), 
where kf x Pg2. 
At low temperatures [89, 901, equilibrium effects were found to be 
negligible, and simple pseudo-first-order kinetics were used to obtain values 
of hydrogenation rate constant (kF)

A kinetic model based on a simple first-order reversible reaction was 
developed by Yui and Sanford [91, 921 for aromatics hydrogenation in 
middle distillates.

that m and IZ are equal to 1, integrating the equation and substituting

which is similar to the model proposed by Wilson and Kriz [88-901. 
The model was used to calculate kinetic parameters from published 
catalytic aromatic hydrogenation data from a variety of sources [85, 87, 88, 
931. Aromatic contents at various operating conditions were calculated using 
these kinetic parameters, and good agreement between the observed and 
calculated results was found (Fig. 9). 
In a recent study on kinetics of aromatics hydrogenation of five bitumen 
derived gas oils, Yui and Sanford [94] used a similar method but made the 
assumption that the power term for PH2 was equal to 0.5 when the aromatic 
content was defined as aromatic carbon content. The reasoning was that, 
stoichiometrically, 0.5 mole of hydrogen is consumed in the conversion of 
1 atomic weight of aromatic carbon, irrespective of the aromatic species. 
Furthermore, they introduced a power term for LHSV to account for de- 
viations from plug flow experienced in bench-scale trickle-bed reactors. The 
model gave a reasonable fit to the experimental data, and it was found that 
the degree of hydrogenation at equilibrium was lower for the heavier feed- 
stocks. However, the power term for LHSV was found to vary from feed 
to feed (ranging from 0.28 to 1.0), which is not to be expected if the power 
term is an expression of deviations from plug flow, since flow conditions 
and levels of conversion were similar for each feed. It is possible that the 
variation in the power term is an artefact stemming from the use of a model 
based on a single, reversible reaction to describe what is in fact a series of 
consecutive reactions. It is also a simplification to assume that the power

where T = ULHSV, x = the power term for hydrogen partial pressure in 
the forward reaction, E = the activation energy for the forward reaction,

that demonstrate the results of the model fit. Figure 10 shows how the 
concentrations of DA and MA change through a long reactor. The DA + 
MA reaction is much faster than the MA + 
AH reaction. Therefore, in 
the first part of the reactor, DAs disappear rapidly whereas the MAS in- 
crease, and the reduction of total aromatics is therefore small. As the 
equilibrium ratio between DA and MA is approached (the straight line 
from O.O), the fast DA + 
MA reaction cannot proceed until MAS are 
coverted to AHs at a low rate. 
The other straight line in the diagram represents the equilibrium ratio 
between MA and AH. The equilibrium concentrations are where the two 
lines cross each other. 
Figure 11 shows how the MAS and MA + DAs vary in the product 
as a function of the reactor temperature for one fixed LHSV. This pattern 
is very similar to what was found in the tests. 
Cooper et a1 [202] report finding zero-order kinetics using a sulfur- 
tolerant noble metal catalyst. 
None of the kinetic expressions discussed above include adsorption 
equilibrium constants for reactants, products, and inhibitors such as H,S. 
Consequently, the adsorption mechanisms and the competition between the 
reactants and products including H,S and their effect on the reaction rate 
are not represented in these kinetic models. 
In general, the use of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen- 
Watson 
(LHHW)-type of rate equation for representing the hydrogenation kinetics 
of industrial feedstocks is complicated, and there are too many coefficients 
that are difficult to determine. Therefore, simple power law models have 
been used by most researchers to fit kinetic data and obtain kinetic param- 
eters.

V. CATALYSTS AND NATURE OF CATALYTIC SITES 
A. Catalysts 
Aromatic hydrogenation in industrial feedstocks may be carried out 
over supported metal or metal sulfide catalysts depending on the sulfur and 
nitrogen levels in the feedstock. For hydrorefining of feedstocks that contain 
appreciable concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen, sulfided Ni-Mo, Ni-W, 
or Co-Mo on y-A2-03 
catalysts are generally used, whereas supported noble 
metal catalysts have been used for sulfur- and nitrogen-free feedstocks. 
Catalysts containing noble metals on Y-zeolites have been reported to be 
more sulfur tolerant than those on other supports [98,99], and such catalysts 
have increasingly been used in recent years for hydrogenation of aromatics 
in light and middle distillates [loo, 1011 containing appreciable amounts of 
sulfur. Within the series of Co- or Ni-promoted group VI metal (Mo or W) 
sulfides supported on y-Alz03, 
the ranking Ni-W > Ni-Mo > Co-Mo > 
Co-W has been found [lo21 for hydrogenation, and Ni-W and Ni-Mo/Al,O, 
catalysts are widely used to reduce sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics levels 
in petroleum fractions by hydrotreating. It would be useful to discuss the 
recent understanding of the nature of catalytic centers involved in aromatic 
hydrogenation and the interaction between the competitive HDS and HDN 
reactions that occurs simultaneously with AH.

B. Nature of 
Catalytic Sites in Sulfide Catalysts 
The nature of active phases of unpromoted and promoted molybdenum 
and tungsten sulfide hydrotreating catalysts has been widely studied and 
reported in several reviews [ 
103- 1091. For unpromoted molybdenum or 
tungsten sulfile catalysts, it has been proposed that the coordinatively un- 
saturated (CUS) sites (or exposed Mo ions with sulfur vacancies at the 
edges and corners of MoS, (or WS2) structures are active in hydrogenation 
and hydrogenolysis reactions. Basal planes are inactive in adsorption of 
molecules and are probably unimportant in hydrotreating reactions. For 
Co- or Ni-promoted catalysts, several different structural models such as 
monolayer model [110, 1111, intercalation model [112,113], contact synergy 
model [114, 1151, Co-Mo-S phase model [116-1191, and catalytic Co site 
model [120, 1211 have been proposed to explain the role of the promoter 
and its location in the catalyst. It is not the aim of this section to discuss 
the various models in detail. However, the relevant points of two important 
models, namely the contact synergy model and the Co-Mo-S phase model 
are briefly discussed to gain a better understanding of the nature of cata- 
lytically active centers and the interaction between various reactions that 
occur simultaneously during the hydrotreating of industrial feedstocks. 
In the contact synergy model proposed by Delmon [104, 114, 1151, it 
is assumed that MoS2 
and Co9S8 
exist as separate crystallites in contact with 
each other, and that the role of the promoter (Cogs8) 
is to activate and 
provide hydrogen atoms to MoS2. 
These spilled-over hydrogen atoms would 
create reduced centers on the MoS, surface, which would be the catalytically 
active sites. 
In the Co-Mo-S (or Ni-Mo-S) phase model proposed by Topsge and 
co-workers [ 
116- 118,123,1241, the promoter atoms (Co or Ni) are located 
at the edges of MoSJike structures in the plane of Mo cations. The relative 
amount of Co atoms present as Co-Mo-S phase was shown to correlate 
linearly with HDS activity [122, 1251. Some possible locations and coor- 
dination of the Co atoms decorating the edges of MoS, slabs are illustrated 
in Fig. 12. The evidence of the Co-Mo-S phase has subsequently been 
carefully examined by various techniques, and at present the location of 
the promoter ion as described by Topsge and co-workers is widely accepted. 
Although the catalytically active sites involved in hydrotreating reac- 
tions are generally viewed as sulfur vacancies (or anionic vacancies), it is 
still a matter of debate whether both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis 
occur on the same type of site or on different types of sites. 
Various kinetic studies with model compounds have indicated the ex- 
istence of two distinct types of catalytic sites, one responsible for hydro- 
genation and the other one responsible for hydrogenolysis 
of the heteroatom 
[81, 127-1291. Several authors have reported that H2S significantly en- 
hances HDN [130- 1341 but moderately inhibits hydrogenation [132, 135- 
1381. Nitrogen bases have also been reported to inhibit the HDS, HDN,

and AH reactions differently [81,135, 139- 1421. Different inhibiting effects 
of H2S 
on hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenols have 
also been noticed recently [143]. On the other hand, no inhibiting effect 
was observed on HDS of thiophene [81] and HDN of 2,4-dimethyl pyridine 
in the presence of aromatic compounds [142]. 
The existence of two types of catalytic sites has been proposed to 
explain these observations [Sl, 126, 127, 130, 143, 1441. Based on a sys- 
tematic study of hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and hydrogenolysis 
of S, N-, and 0-containing model compounds, Geneste and co-workers 
[79-811 showed that hydrogenation reactions were mainly affected by the 
aromatic properties of the molecules and not by the nature of the hetero- 
atoms. By contrast, hydrogenolysis reactions were found to depend 
on the nature of the heteroatom. It was suggested that hydrogenation and 
hydrogenolysis reactions could proceed via different adsorption mecha- 
nisms: hydrogenation through horizontal n-adsorption and hydrogenolysis 
through vertical adsorption by the heteroatom [79-811. These authors also 
proposed a dual-site mechanism involving Mo or W atoms at different 
oxidation levels, the higher oxidation state for the hydrogenation site and 
the lower one for the hydrogenolysis site [79, 811. Furthermore, based on 
theoretical calculations and experimental results on adsorption and reac- 
tivity of model S, 0, 
and N aromatic molecules, these authors demonstrated 
that hydrogenation is favored by strongly electron-donating substituents, 
and hydrogenolysis by slightly electron-donating (or electron-withdrawing)

HYDROGENATION 
substituents (Scheme 6). Concerning the nature of these two sites, these 
authors argue that Mo or W atoms with 3 sulfur vacancies (higher oxidation 
state) at the corners are primarily responsible for hydrogenation through 
n-adsorption, and that the hydrogenolysis site could be an edge site with 
two sulfur vacancies [81]. 
However, in apparent contradiction with the above conclusion, Topsoe 
and co-workers [103, 1451 argue that for a given catalyst, HDS, HDN, and 
AH reactions can occur on the same sites. Their kinetic model assumes 
that the reactants, intermediates, and products chemisorb competitively on 
the same sites, and that under typical reaction conditions, a majority of the 
surface sites are covered by the atomic species H-*, S-*, and N-*, and not 
molecular species. Accordingly, one may visualize the HDS, HDN, and 
AH reactions as taking place in vacancies in a mixed surface-sulfide-hydride 
and nitride phase. 
Based on kinetic data on simultaneous HDS, HDN, and AH reactions 
over a series of different, sulfided hydrotreating catalysts such as Mo/A1,03, 
Ni-Mo/A1,03, Ni-Mo-P/Al,O,, and Co-Mo/Al,03, they suggested that the 
major effect of the Co and Ni promoter atoms lies in the lowering of 
equilibrium constants for S-* and N-* formation. As a result, the promoted 
catalysts will have a larger fraction of free sites under identical conditions. 
In Co- or Ni-promoted hydrotreating catalysts (e.g., Co-Mo/Al,O,, 
Ni-Mo/A1203), 
surface sites related to both promoted MoS, edge sites (Co- 
Mo-S) and unpromoted MoS, edges will be present. Both of these may 
catalyze hydrotreating reactions, and in general the total activity ktot 
can 
be expressed as [123]:

and kMoedge are the specific activities for promoted and un- 
promoted edge sites, respectively. @Coedge is the coverage of the MoS, edges 
by promoter atoms, and &dge is the total concentration of MoS, edge atoms

depends on the reaction. Thus, unless OCoedge 
is very small, the catalysis is 
expected to be dominated by the promoted sites. 
Some authors [14, 130, 132, 144, 1461 have suggested that hydrogen- 
ation sites on the catalyst surface can be transformed into hydrogenolysis 
centers by the adsorption of H2S (Scheme 7). This means that one type of 
sulfur or anion vacancy present on sulfided catalysts is enough to explain 
the results. The distribution sites I and I1 would depend essentially on the 
sulfidation state of the catalyst and on the partial pressure of H2S. Con- 
sequently, the effect of H2S 
on the relative rates of different reactions would 
be expected to depend on the H2S partial pressure during the reaction [14, 
103, 147, 1481. 
Enhancement of HDN reaction rate at low H2S partial pressures and 
inhibition at higher H2S 
partial pressures have been predicted by the model 
proposed by Topsae and co-workers I1031 based on one type of site for 
different reactions (Fig. 13), which is in good agreement with the experi- 
mental results reported in the literature by various workers [128, 130, 132, 
147, 149, 1501. 
Interconversion of hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis sites on hydro- 
treating catalysts is now widely accepted. For kinetic modeling of hydro-

treating reactions, one kind of catalytic site could therefore be assumed, as 
suggested by Tops@e 
et al. [103]. 
Recently, Vivier et al. [144] have suggested that two categories of site 
I, namely promoted and nonpromoted, are possible. After H2S adsorption 
both would lead to sites 11, but only promoted sites I are assumed to be 
really active in hydrogenation reactions. 
Nitrogen compounds as well as H2S have been reported to inhibit the 
hydrogenation of aromatic compounds strongly (136, 137, 142, 143). These 
compounds are probably more strongly adsorbed on the hydrogenation 
centers than on other centers that can catalyze the essentially hydrogenolysis 
reactions. Competition between different nitrogen, sulfur, and aromatic 
compounds present in the feed toward adsorption on hydrogenation sites 
is possible, and the preference for adsorption in such a competitive envi- 
ronment depends largely on the values of adsorption strengths of different 
compounds. The following sequence has been proposed recently by Vivier 
et al. [144] for the adsorption strength on hydrogenation centers: 
R-C6H5 < NH, < aniline, H2S << decahydroquinoline 
< 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline 
= quinoline 
This is basically consistent with the previous findings by La Vopa and 
Satterfield [ 
1401, except for decahydroquinoline. 
The above sequence indicates that inhibition of aromatics hydrogen- 
ation by quinoline and the products of its hydrogenation is stronger than 
that of ammonia, H2S, and alkyl anilines; and that ammonia is a stronger 
inhibitor of hydrogenation than hydrogen sulfide. 
Thus, hydrogenation of aromatics in real feeds under industrial hy- 
drotreating conditions would be inhibited by various organic sulfur and 
nitrogen compounds present in the feed as well as by H2S 
and NH, produced 
by HDS and HDN reactions. These inhibiting effects coupled with ther- 
modynamic equilibrium limitations (under the normal operating range of 
hydrotreating) make aromatic reduction in industrial feeds (e.g. , 
diesel) 
more difficult. 
Modeling of the inhibition by nitrogen compounds was attempted by 
several workers using Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate equations [151, 
1421, and the adsorption parameters estimated from such models were found 
to be consistent with the above sequence. 
In the case of the inhibition by sulfur compounds, especially H,S, 
modeling of the inhibition is complicated since H2S adsorption can modify 
the catalyst surface leading to interconversion of catalytic sites, as men- 
tioned earlier. 
In general , 
quantitative information on ,adsorption parameters char- 
acterizing inhibition by different types of sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen com- 
pounds is lacking.

 Sulfur-Tolerant Noble Metal Catalysts 
Adsorption and hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons on group 
VIII metals have been studied extensively and the subject has been reviewed 
by Moyes and Wells [152] and by Garnett [153]. It is now generally agreed 
that aromatic hydrogenation on these metals involves a .rr-complex adsorp- 
tion mechanism. 
Group VIII metal catalysts used in hydrogenation reactions are known 
to deactivate rapidly by adsorption of sulfur-containing species that are 
present in industrial feedstocks [154, 1551. Sulfur is generally considered to 
be a poison for hydrogenation catalysts, and extensive research has been 
undertaken to develop sulfur-tolerant metal catalysts. Discussions in this 
section are mainly focused on noble metal (e.g., Pt and Pd) on Y-zeolite 
catalysts that have received increasing attention in recent years as important 
industrial catalysts for aromatics hydrogenation [loo, 101, 197, 2011. 
An important and interesting property of these catalysts is their high 
sulfur tolerance [98, 156-1611. It is reported that the metals are present in 
the form of highly dispersed small particles or clusters within the zeolite 
cavities. The zeolite modifies the electronic state of the metal particles (Pt 
or Pd), which in turn changes the strength of the Pt-S bond. 
The resistance to sulfur poisoning is suggested to come from the small 
bonding energy of the electron acceptor sulfur atoms with the electron- 
deficient Pt or Pd clusters [156, 1621. Hence, the higher the electron defi- 
ciency, the better the sulfur resistance. This has been substantiated by 
investigations of the electronic structure of Pt and Pd clusters in Y-zeolites 
[98, 162, 157, 1631. The electron-deficient nature of Pt and Pd aggregates 
in zeolites has been firmly established by several techniques such as IR, 
electron spin resonance (ESR), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 
extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) , 
and Fourier-transform 
infrared (FTIR) [162-1701. The zeolite protons are proposed to be re- 
sponsible for the formation of electron-deficient metal particles, as follows 
[168]: 
n[Pd2+ + 202,;;,,] + nH2+ Pdf + 2nH-OWall 
The electron deficiency of the metal should have an adverse effect on the 
resistance to poisoning by electron-donor molecules. This was indeed shown 
to be the case for poisoning of Pt in Y-zeolite with ammonia [162, 171- 
1731. 
The activity, selectivity, and resistance to poisoning of these catalysts 
depend to a large extent on the location, size/dispersion, and structure of 
the metal particles in zeolites, which in turn are strictly controlled by the 
preparation and pretreatment conditions.

The preparation of noble metal/zeolite catalysts normally consists of 
three main steps: (i) metal loading, (ii) calcination, and (iii) reduction. The 
noble metals are usually introduced by ion exchange or impregnation by 
pore saturation using the tetramine salt [e.g., Pt(NH,),(NO,),] 
solutions, 
The main purpose of the calcination and reduction steps is to decompose 
the ammine ligands attached to the metal, to remove the physisorbed water, 
and to reduce the metal ions to metal atoms. 
Several studies have shown that variations in catalyst calcination and 
reduction procedures have a major effect on the dispersion and location of 
the metals as well as on the activity and selectivity of the Pt and Pd/Y- 
zeolite catalysts [156, 172, 174-1841. 
A schematic description of the processes that can occur during calcin- 
ation and reduction of Pd(NH,),2+ ions in NaY zeolites is shown in Fig. 14, 
which includes the following: (1) destruction of ligands L, (2) migration of 
complexed or bare metal ions from supercages to sodalite cages and the 
reverse process, (3) reduction of ions in various locations and different 
degrees of complexation, (4) reoxidation of metal atoms in sodalite cages, 
and (5) migration of these atoms to supercages, where they might be at- 
tached to existing clusters, forming grape-shaped particles. 
The metal particle size after reduction is dictated by the location and 
coordination o
f
 the metal ions in the calcination step. Accordingly, the 
conditions of calcination and reduction steps should be carefully optimized 
to retain well-dispersed metal particles in the large supercages of Y-zeolite. 
Metal dispersion will be low and metals will be located in the inaccessible 
Supercages

Zeolite-supported noble metal catalysts that might tolerate several 
hundred parts per million sulfur could be prepared by careful optimization 
of the preparation procedures. The performance of such catalysts is dis- 
cussed in the next section, dealing with industrial aspects of the aromatic 
hydrogenation process. 
VI. 
INDUSTRIAL ASPECTS 
In view of stringent environmental regulations with regard to aromatics 
level [as low as 5%(v)] in diesel fuel, aromatics reduction has become a 
key upgrading parameter in processing middle distillates. Intensive research 
efforts have been made in recent years to develop catalysts and processes 
for producing low-aromatic diesel fuel. Several workers [87, 88, 185- 1881 
have attempted to optimize the process conditions or maximizing aromatic 
hydrogenation using existing hydrotreating catalysts, that is, sulfides of Co- 
Mo, Ni-Mo, and Ni-W supported on y-alumina. Because of their poor 
activity, such catalysts require high temperatures leading to an equilibrium 
shift favoring the reverse reaction (Fig. 15). Very high hydrogen partial 
pressures are required at such high temperatures for shifting the thermo- 
dynamic equilibrium in favor of the forward reaction. In general, severe 
operating conditions such as high temperatures, low space velocities, and 
high pressures were found to be necessary to achieve acceptable aromatic 
reduction.

350°C with plus or minus some front or back end. They contain mainly 
paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes, and aromatics with some sulfur- and ni- 
trogen-containing compounds. The carbon number of the component hy- 
drocarbon structures is generally in the C12-C25 
range. The aromatic stream 
may contain several types of mono-, di-, and condensed polyaromatic 
structures, and their hydrogenation reactivities are considerably different. 
First-ring hydrogenation of condensed polyaromatic hydrocarbons is most 
favored kinetically and occurs at relatively low temperatures and pressures. 
For example, during hydrotreating of gas oil over a commercial Ni- 
Mo/A1,0, catalyst, Matarrese et al. [87] noticed that polyaromatics are 
hydrogenated to a considerable extent at 320"C, a temperature at which 
monoaromatics only start reacting. An increase of temperature and pressure 
did not have any significant effect on polyaromatic hydrogenation, whereas 
monoaromatic conversion increased sharply up to 360°C and then decreased 
due to thermodynamic equilibrium limitation which favors the reverse re- 
action at higher temperatures. It should be remembered that polyaromatics 
are saturated ring by ring in successive steps. 
Table 7 summarizes the operating severities reported by various re- 
search groups for aromatic reduction in diesel and gas oils in single-stage 
reactors. The data presented in this table clearly show that achieving low 
levels of aromatics by single-stage hydrotreating over sulfided Ni-Mo- or 
Ni-W-type catalysts requires very low space velocities and very high hy- 
drogen partial pressures. Addition of parallel reactors requiring additional 
capital for the new equipment would be needed to allow lowering of the 
space velocity without decreasing throughput. 
At low temperatures and high space velocities, the amount of mon- 
oaromatics in the product has been found to be higher than that originally 
present in the feed. This is not unexpected since every mole of triaromatic 
compound that is saturated would add a mole to the diaromatics, and every 
mole of diaromatic compound hydrogenated would add a mole to the mon- 
oaromatic category, which is hydrogenated at a slower rate than the cor- 
responding diaromatic compound. 
Thus conversion of the monoaromatics is the key step in the production 
of low-aromatic diesel fuel by hydrogenation. Since the reaction is primarily 
controlled by kinetics at lower temperatures, it would be possible to achieve 
high conversion by using highly active catalysts that could promote aromatic 
hydrogenation reactions at relatively low temperatures and pressures. 
Extensive research has been undertaken by various catalyst manufac- 
turing companies in recent years to develop more active hydrogenation 
catalysts. Information available on current research indicates that highly 
active hydrogenation catalysts, utilizing supported group VIII metals such 
as Pt, Pd, Ru, and Ni, may significantly improve the efficiency of these 
processes [39, 189-1961. Aromatic saturation reactions may be carried out 
at thermodynamically favorable conditions. However, the stability of these

supported metal catalysts in processing sulfur-containing feedstocks could 
be a problem. Thus, for example, a silica-supported nickel catalyst was 
found to exhibit an initial activity much superior to that of conventional 
hydrotreating catalysts, but its tolerance to sulfur poisoning was low and 
inadequate for commercial use [39, 1901. This problem might be alleviated 
through the use of sulfur-tolerant noble metal catalysts. The performance 
of such catalysts has been reported in patent literature. Supported RuS, 
catalysts have been reported to be highly active for hydrogenation in an 
H,S environment [191, 192, 194-1961. However, for catalysts containing 
Pt, Pd, and Ni, the sulfur and nitrogen in the feedstocks should be reduced 
to certain minimum levels by hydrotreating prior to processing over these 
noble metal catalysts. As a result, two-stage processing technologies have 
been developed and their performance in producing diesel fuels at the 
specified low-sulfur [loo, 101, 1971 and low-aromatics limits has been dem- 
ons 
trated. 
A two-stage process [loll has been developed by IFP for upgrading 
LCO by aromatics hydrogenation. In the first stage, deep hydrodesulfuri- 
zation reduces the sulfur and nitrogen contents to much less than 50 wppm 
and 1 
wppm, respectively. In the second stage, deep aromatic hydrogenation 
takes place at a relatively low hydrogen partial pressure with a very active 
catalyst that tolerates the small amounts of residual sulfur. 
A similar two-stage process has been reported by Shell [201]. In the 
first stage, an Ni-Mo/Al,O, catalyst (C 424) is used for deep HDS and 
HDN, after which the product is stripped to remove H2S and NH3, and is 
processed over a noble metal catalyst (e.g. , 
Pt on amorphous silica: C 614) 
for deep aromatic hydrogenation. The second-stage catalyst can tolerate 
organic sulfur levels of about 5-10 wppm. 
Criterion catalyst company has introduced a new catalyst technology 
jointly with Lummus Crest Inc. for aromatics conversion at low pressure 
[198]. The process known as SynSat (short for synergetic saturation) is 
claimed to be an economically attractive route to aromatic reduction in 
diesel fuels. The SynSat reactor design utilizes both concurrent and coun- 
tercurrent liquidlvapor contacting in separate catalyst beds. The design is 
geared to optimize both hydrogen partial pressure and reactor temperature 
profiles. The reactors can either be added to existing hydrotreaters or built 
as new units. The performance data [198], however, indicate that high 
hydrogen partial pressures and very low space velocities (e.g., 0.3 h-l) 
would be required to reduce the aromatics from 29 wt% by about 60% (to 
12 wt%) in a feed blend containing 67% virgin gas oil and 33% coker gas 
oil. 
Criterion has also developed a two-stage process [loo] using conven- 
tional hydrotreating catalysts in the first stage to reduce the sulfur and 
nitrogen levels to less than 10 wppm and using a noble metallzeolite catalyst 
for deep aromatic hydrogenation (>95%) in the second stage at relatively 
low temperatures (260-315°C) and pressures (4.2 MPa), and high space

velocities (LHSV 3-4 h-l). At higher sulfur (1200 wppm) and nitrogen 
(200 wppm) levels in the feedstock, hydrogen partial pressure as high as 
10.5 MPa was found to be necessary to achieve 85% aromatic hydrogenation 
in this process. 
Recently, Haldor Topsoe has developed new technologies for mod- 
erate and deep aromatic hydrogenation in diesel fuel. Using a conventional 
Ni-Mo catalyst in the first stage and a sulfur-tolerant noble metal catalyst 
(TK 908) in the second stage, 85% aromatic saturation was achieved on a 
feed containing 1.7 wt% sulfur, 225 wppm nitrogen, and 36 wt% aromatics 
[197,199,202] at low H2 
pressures (5.0 MPa) and low temperatures (315°C). 
The relative reactor volume in this process was 50% lower as compared 
with single-stage operation using a conventional Ni-Mo catalyst despite 
lower operating pressure and temperature. On another feedstock, stable 
operation was demonstrated in a 6000-h test producing diesel with max 5% 
aromatics. For moderate levels (25-50%) of aromatics saturation, a two- 
stage process with NiMo catalyst in the first stage and Ni-W in the second 
stage has been recommended. 
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
New environmental regulations governing diesel fuel specifications limit 
the aromatic content to low levels, and as a result processes and catalysts 
for aromatic hydrogenation in middle distillates have received renewed 
interest. In this paper we have reviewed the literature regarding the state 
of aromatics hydrogenation (AH) processes and catalysts. Fundamental 
studies concerning the kinetic, thermodynamic, mechanistic, and catalytic 
chemistry aspects of aromatic hydrogenation reactions have been examined 
critically. Recent scientific literature on the nature of active hydrogenation 
sites in hydrotreating catalysts has been reviewed with particular emphasis 
on the interaction between AH, HDS, and HDN reactions. The factors 
that influence the reactivity of aromatic compounds have also been ad- 
dressed. Special attention has been paid to new developments in catalysts 
(including sulfur-tolerant noble metal catalysts) and processing technologies 
for reduction of aromatics to acceptable low levels in the diesel blending 
streams in the light of stringent environmental regulations. 
Unlike HDS and HDN, aromatic hydrogenation is more difficult to 
achieve over conventional hydrotreating catalysts under conditions that are 
normally used for lowering sulfur and nitrogen levels, and the reactions are 
controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium. Conversion of di- and triaro- 
matics to monoaromatics occurs even at low severity, but the monoaro- 
matics remain nearly unchanged. Hydrogenation of the monoaromatics is 
the key step in the production of low-aromatic diesel fuel. With conventional 
hydrotreating catalysts this can only be achieved at high hydrogen pressures 
and low space velocities, generally requiring new and expensive equipment. 
Aromatic saturation reactions may be carried out under both kineti-

cally and thermodynamically favorable conditions using highly active noble 
metal catalysts. However, the sulfur and nitrogen levels of the feedstock 
should be reduced to certain minimum limits by hydrotreating prior to 
processing over these catalysts. As a result, two-stage processes for com- 
bined deep HDS and AH have been developed. Production of diesel fuels 
with less than 5%(v) aromatics and less than 10 wppm sulfur is possible in 
such two-stage processes. 
Reaction kinetic studies with model aromatic compounds have pro- 
vided valuable insight into the adsorption and reaction mechanisms. In 
industrial feeds, however, several types of aromatics are present, whose 
AH reactivities differ considerably. 
The polyaromatic hydrogenation occurs ring by ring in successive steps 
which are all in equilibrium. The kinetic models for aromatic hydrogenation 
in real industrial feeds should take the reversible consecutive reactions into 
consideration. The use of Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type rate equations for 
representing hydrogenation kinetics of industrial feeds is complicated. Sim- 
ple power law models have been used by most researchers to fit kinetic 
data. 
As regards the nature of active hydrogenation sites, although our 
understanding of the nature of surface sites and their functions has improved 
remarkably in recent years, there is still considerable debate as to whether 
both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis occur on the same type of site or 
on different types of site. No clear explanation is available in the litera- 
ture of the opposite trends in the relative rates of hydrogenation of alkyl 
benzenes over metal (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni) and metal sulfide (e.g., MoS,, 
Co-Mo-S, Ni-Mo-S, Ni-W-S) catalysts. It is possible that the adsorption 
mechanism of aromatic molecules on the two types of catalysts is entirely 
different so that the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring is enhanced in one 
type of catalyst and suppressed in the other by the presence of electron- 
donating groups in the aromatic ring. The question still remains open and 
obviously more research is needed on this subject. 
A wealth of information available on sulfur-tolerant noble metal ca- 
talysts including the peformance of such catalysts in the hydrogenation of 
aromatics in industrial feedstocks has been discussed in this review. Since 
the resistance to sulfur poisoning is suggested to result from electron de- 
ficiency of the noble metals, the presence of electron-donor molecules such 
as NH3 or organic nitrogen compounds in the feed would have an adverse 
effect. In other words, the sulfur resistance property of the catalyst may be 
lost if appreciable amounts of nitrogen compounds are present in the feed. 
More research is needed for developing both sulfur- and nitrogen-resistant 
catalysts. 
Finally, aromatic hydrogenation in middle distillates will grow in im- 
portance in the petroleum refining industry and the corresponding catalysts 
and processes will continue to improve steadily. A fundamental understand- 
ing of the nature of the catalytic sites, reaction mechanisms, and chemical 
nature of different types of aromatic compounds present in industrial feeds

and their reactivities will facilitate more efficient use of the existing catalysts 
as well as provide a basis for developing improved catalysts and processes.
