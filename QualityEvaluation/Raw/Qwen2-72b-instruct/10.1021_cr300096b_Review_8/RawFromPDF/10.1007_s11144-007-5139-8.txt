Abstract
The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied. The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles.
