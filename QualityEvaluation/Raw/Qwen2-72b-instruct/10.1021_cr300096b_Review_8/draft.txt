1. Comprehensive analysis of Pt-3d catalysts for C═C bond hydrogenation: Integration of DFT calculations, experimental validation, and structure-activity relationships for catalyst design and performance prediction.

DFT calculations elucidate that the Pt-terminated surfaces of bimetallic Pt-3d catalysts exhibit weaker bonding to hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are accountable for higher hydrogenation rates \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. This observation is corroborated by experimental findings from techniques such as TPD measurements, which have demonstrated that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts manifest superior hydrogenation rates for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene over the monometallic Pt catalyst \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. The enhancement in hydrogenation rates can be attributed to the presence of Pt-terminated configurations in the bimetallic catalysts \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for a variety of C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts align with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be harnessed to forecast hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems \[10.1039/c2gc16544a\]. Goda et al. performed DFT calculations for 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, revealing that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds these molecules more weakly than Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, mirroring the trend observed for cyclohexene \[10.1021/cr300096b_8\]. Murillo et al. substantiated these predictions through TPD measurements of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111) \[10.1021/cr300096b_8\]. These results suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity \[10.1021/cr300096b_8\]. Similar DFT calculations have been conducted for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces \[10.1021/cr300096b_8\]. Based on binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to exhibit high hydrogenation activity for these molecules, a prediction that has been validated in reactor studies \[10.1021/cr300096b_8\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The integration of DFT calculations and experimental techniques such as TPD measurements has provided a robust framework for understanding the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts. This approach has not only enabled the prediction of hydrogenation activity but also informed the design of more efficient catalytic systems. Future research endeavors might focus on expanding the scope of DFT calculations to encompass a broader range of C═C bond-containing molecules and exploring the effects of different bimetallic compositions on hydrogenation activity. Additionally, the development of advanced experimental techniques that can provide more detailed insights into the catalytic process could further enhance our understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalysts. The integration of machine learning algorithms with DFT calculations could also offer a promising avenue for predicting the hydrogenation activity of novel catalysts, potentially accelerating the discovery of more efficient catalytic systems.
