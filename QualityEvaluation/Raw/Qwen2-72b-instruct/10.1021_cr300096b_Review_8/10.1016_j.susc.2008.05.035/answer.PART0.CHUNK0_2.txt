1.DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption of linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes were compared against the d-band center of the substrates, showing a relationship between the two. The bonding of an alkene to a transition metal is controlled by the balance between attractive interactions and Pauli repulsion. The Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces do not follow the same trend as other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. DFT was also used to study the adsorption of cyclohexene on 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, showing that cyclohexene binds in the CC di-σ boat configuration. The binding energy of cyclohexene on Pt(1 1 1) was calculated to be 0.85 eV. Binding energies were compared as a function of the surface d-band center. TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces were compared with DFT calculations. The activities for each bimetallic surface were listed. The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. The results for binding energy vs. the surface d-band center were depicted. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is very weak compared to Pt(1 1 1). The adsorption of benzene was studied for both bridge(30) and hollow(0) sites, with the binding energy on the bridge(30) site being higher than the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length was studied by comparing the adsorption of linear alkenes on the metal surfaces. The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared to study the effect of cyclic structure, showing that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by correlating DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements.

1.使用DFT计算研究了线性烯烃（1-丁烯、1-戊烯、1-己烯）在单金属和双金属表面上的吸附。将这些烯烃的结合能与基底的d带中心进行了比较，显示了两者之间的关系。烯烃与过渡金属的结合受吸引相互作用和泡利排斥的平衡控制。Cu/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面不遵循与其他3d/Pt(1 1 1)表面相同的趋势。使用DFT研究了3d/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上环己烯的吸附，显示环己烯以CC di-σ船型结合。计算得到环己烯在Pt(1 1 1)上的结合能为0.85 eV。将结合能作为表面d带中心的函数进行了比较。将Ni/Pt(1 1 1)和Cu/Pt(1 1 1)表面上环己烯的TPD结果与DFT计算进行了比较。列出了每个双金属表面的活性。还研究了环己烯与Cu/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面的相互作用。描绘了结合能与表面d带中心的关系。所有亚表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)结构上的结合比Pt(1 1 1)弱得多。研究了桥(30)和空穴(0)位点的苯的吸附，桥(30)位点的结合能高于空穴(0)位点。亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上苯的结合比1-己烯和环己烯都弱。通过比较金属表面上线性烯烃的吸附，研究了碳链长度的影响。比较了1-己烯和环己烯的结合，以研究环状结构的影响，结果表明，在几乎所有双金属表面上，环状结构的结合能较低。通过将DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联，集成的理论和实验方法可用于预测氢化活性，并指导更高效Pt-3d催化系统的开发。
