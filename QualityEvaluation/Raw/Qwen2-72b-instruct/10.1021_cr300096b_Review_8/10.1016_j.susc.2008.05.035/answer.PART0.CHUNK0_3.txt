1.DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption of linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were compared against the d-band center of the substrates. The Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1), do not follow the same trend as other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. DFT was also used to study the adsorption of cyclohexene on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. The binding energy vs. the surface d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene shows that the binding becomes weaker as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures is very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). The binding energies for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene are similar and lower compared to ethylene. The binding energy comparison between 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the Pt-based bimetallic surfaces shows that cyclohexene binds more weakly than 1-hexene on all the surfaces. The weaker bonding of cyclohexene, as compared to 1-hexene, can be attributed to the electron-donating character of the two molecules. The binding energies on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures. The binding energy on the bridge(30) site is higher than the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene. These DFT calculations correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

1.使用DFT计算研究了线性烯烃（1-丁烯，1-戊烯，1-己烯）在单金属和双金属过渡金属表面上的吸附。比较了这些烯烃在不同表面上的结合能与基底的d带中心。Cu/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面，PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)，与其他3d/Pt(1 1 1)表面的趋势不同。还使用DFT研究了3d/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上环己烯的吸附。1-丁烯，1-戊烯和1-己烯的结合能与表面d带中心的关系表明，随着表面d带中心远离费米能级，结合变得较弱。所有子表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)结构上的结合比Pt(1 1 1)弱得多。1-丁烯，1-戊烯和1-己烯的结合能与乙烯相比相似且较低。Pt基双金属表面上1-己烯和环己烯的结合能比较表明，环己烯在所有表面上的结合都比1-己烯弱。与1-己烯相比，环己烯的较弱结合可以归因于两种分子的电子供体特性。子表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)结构上的结合能低于Pt(1 1 1)表面，而3d-PtPt(1 1 1)表面结构上的结合较强。桥(30)位点的结合能高于空位(0)。子表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上苯的结合比1-己烯和环己烯都弱。这些DFT计算与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果很好地相关，可用于预测氢化活性并指导更有效的Pt-3d催化系统的开发。
