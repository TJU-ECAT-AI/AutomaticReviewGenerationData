1.DFT calculations were used to examine the adsorption of three linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene) on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces. The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were compared against the d-band center of the substrates. The binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene, and 1-hexene is shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3b, respectively. The Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1), do not follow the same trend as other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. TPD results after dosing cyclohexene on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces are shown in Figure 5 to compare DFT calculations with experimental results. The activities for each bimetallic surface are listed in Table 2. The results for binding energy vs. the surface d-band center for benzene are depicted in Figure 6c. The binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1). The effect of hydrocarbon chain length was studied by comparing the adsorption of the linear alkenes on the metal surfaces. The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared to study the effect of cyclic structure, and the results showed that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces.

1.使用DFT计算研究了三种线性烯烃（1-丁烯、1-戊烯和1-己烯）在单金属和双金属过渡金属表面上的吸附。将这些烯烃在不同表面上的结合能与基底的d带中心进行了比较。1-丁烯、1-戊烯和1-己烯的结合能与d带中心的关系分别显示在图1、2和3b中。Cu/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面，即PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)，与其他3d/Pt(1 1 1)表面的趋势不同。图5显示了在Ni/Pt(1 1 1)和Cu/Pt(1 1 1)表面上投射环己烯后的TPD结果，以将DFT计算与实验结果进行比较。每个双金属表面的活性列在表2中。苯的结合能与表面d带中心的关系显示在图6c中。与Pt(1 1 1)相比，所有Pt3dPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上的结合都非常弱。通过比较金属表面上线性烯烃的吸附，研究了碳氢链长度的影响。通过比较1-己烯和环己烯的结合来研究环状结构的影响，结果表明，在几乎所有双金属表面上，环状结构的结合能较低。
