The catalytic activity in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening of naphthalene and thio- tolerance to dibenzothiophene were investigated at 6.0 MPa in a flow reactor. Both catalysts showed interesting performances.
Of the two catalysts, the former showed higher productivities in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis/ring-opening compounds together with lower losses in carbon balance and higher thio-tolerance. These results not only confirmed that Pd/Pt is one of the most suitable bimetallic pair for noble metal containing hydrotreating catalysts, but also that the Al/Ce/Mg PILC can be used as low cost support for noble-metal-containing active phases.

1. Introduction
In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases. (Pinnavaia, 1983; Klo- progge, 1998; Vaccari, 1999; Ding et al., 2001). Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts. Moreover, these materials are quite inex- pensive, if compared to zeolites. Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes (Ramos-Galvan 0169-1317/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Applied Clay Science 29 (2005) 224234 www.elsevier.com/locate/clay et al., 1997; Salerno et al., 2003; Mart nez-Ortiz et al.,2003; Salerno et al., 2004). The removal, within the refinery process, of aromatic hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds from light oil fractions (LCO) coming from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has received considerable attention in recent years, due to both the increasing demand of diesel fuels and the progressively more strict environmental regulations (Stanislaus and Cooper, 1994; Cooper and Donnis,1996). Thus, the development of catalytic technolo- gies for aromatic saturation (HYD) or sulphur removal (HDS) is in demand. New materials having catalytic activity in deep hydrotreating now require:high thio-tolerance;controlled surface acidity, to permit hydrogenolysis/ ring-opening reactions to high molecular weight (HMW) compounds having a high cetane number,but avoiding cracking reactions to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, outside the diesel range;adjustable mesoporosity, in order to allow the diffusion of such voluminous molecules inside the pores;stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.
Therefore PILCs can represent suitable supports for catalysts to be used in these reactions, while replacing the more expensive dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al MCM-41 type materials (Sato et al., 1998; Corma et al.,2001; Pawelec et al., 2002). For this purpose, a Al/Ce/ Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r., pillared montmorillonite with larger than usual micropores was prepared by modify- ing a synthetic procedure reported in literature (Her- nando et al., 2001). The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2).
In this work we investigated the catalytic activity and thio-tolerance of these PILC based catalysts in the hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure. This molecule was chosen as model of naphthenes con- tained in LCO fractions (Albertazzi et al., 2003).
Naphthalene may easily be hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4- tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), which can be further,and with higher difficulty, hydrogenated to decahy- dronaphthalene (decalin) isomers (cis+trans). Crack- ing reactions of both tetralin and decalin may also occur, giving undesired LMW compounds (mainly gases) that are outside the diesel range. On the contrary, useful compounds are those derived from hydrogenolysis/ring-opening pathways and called HMW compounds (mainly alkylciclohexanes, alkyl- benzenes, methylindanes and methylindenes, spyro- decane), having high cetane numbers.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the support: montmorillonite
pillared with Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r.
The montmorillonite pillared with Al/Ce/Mg was prepared by modifying a known synthetic procedure (Hernando et al., 2001), using Locron P (Clariant) as source of Al. An aqueous solution (170 mL) contain- ing [Al2(OH)5Cl*23H2O] (0.2083 mol), CeCl3* 7H2O (0.0083 mol) and MgCl2*6H2O (0.0083 mol) was aged for 72 h at 130 8C in a glass vial. The cooled reaction mixture was diluted to 4250 mL. A total amount of 50.0 g of dry Ca-montmorillonite (Detercal P1, Laviosa) was slowly added under vigorous stirring to this solution, and the mixture was kept under continuous stirring for 24 h at room temperature (r.t.),then centrifuged and washed with distilled water until it was free from chloride ions (AgNO3 test). The resulting PILC was then dried at 100 8C for 12 h,ground and heated in airflow at 550 8C for 24 h. The material was successively kept under reduced pressure in the presence of concentrated NH4OH to give the ammonium form (NH4
+PILC).
2.2. Preparation of CAT1 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Pt=5.0 a.r.)
A total of 2.000 g of NH4 +PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing
0.037 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of
[Pt(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at r.t., and then washed with distilled water till Cl ions disappearance. The exchanged clay was dried at 100 8C for 12 h, ground and heated in a glass reactor in air flow at 400 8C for 12 h, (air flow=80 mL/min, heating rate=1 8C/min), followed by cooling under He flow, then it was reduced under a H2 flow at 400 8C (H2 flow=40 mL/min, heating rate=8 8C/min).

2.3. Preparation of CAT2 (1.0 wt.% Pd/Au=5.0 a.r.)
A total of 2.000 g of NH4 +PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.036 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of HAuCl4. The catalyst preparation was then carried out as described in the previous sample.
2.4. Preparation of a reference catalyst (1.0 wt.%
Pd/Pt=4.0 a.r.) As example of the commercial catalysts, a refer- ence sample, containing the same total amount of noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a silicaalumina by Engelhard, according to a widely claimed industrial patent (Vaarkamp et al., 1998).
2.5. Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra were recorded using a Philips PW 1319 goniometer, with Cu Ka1 radiation (k=0.15418 nm, 40 kW, 20 mA).
The samples were disc shaped pressed powders.
N2 adsorptiondesorption experiments were car- ried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The N2 isotherms were used to determine the specific surface areas (SA) using the BET equation. The pore distribution of the investigated samples was determined by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) assuming a slit-like pores model (Webb and Orr, 1997; Rouquerol et al., 1999). The micropore volume was determined using the t-plot method and the total pore volume of the samples, Vt, was calculated at p/p0=0.98. Before each measurement the samples were outgassed for 12 h at 150 8C and 0.7 Pa and for 2 h at r.t. and 0.5*106 Pa.
Ammonia TPD analyses were performed on the pelletised fresh catalysts, using a Thermoquest TPD/R/O 1100 instrument, carrying out a pre-treat- ment with a 40 mL/min He flow up to 500 8C, an adsorption step at 160 8C pulsing a NH3/He=10:90 v/v mixture and a desorption step with a 40 mL/min He flow up to 500 8C.
A Nicolet Nexus instrument, using conventional IR cells connected to a gas manipulation apparatus,recorded FT-IR spectra. The pure powders of the catalysts CAT1 and CAT2 were pressed into self- supporting disks, with an average weight of 30 mg.
Before CO adsorption experiments, each fresh sample has been submitted to an bin situQ reduction treatment consisting in heating in pure hydrogen (53.0 kPa) at 300 8C, followed by outgassing at the same temper- ature in the IR cell itself. CO adsorption has been performed at r.t., and spectra have been recorded at increasing CO partial pressure and after outgassing the samples at r.t. and/or 100 8C.
2.6. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were performed at 6.0 MPa (if not otherwise specified H2/N2=1:1 v/v) and in the 220340 8C range using a stainless steel tubular reactor (i.d. 8 mm, length 54 cm), heated by an electric oven controlled by two J-thermocouples. 6 mL of catalyst (1420 mesh) was employed, located in the isothermal zone of the reactor. During the tests,the catalyst temperature was controlled using a 0.5 mm J-thermocouple sliding in a stainless steel capillary tube inside the catalytic bed. Before the tests, the catalyst was activated in a 200 mL/min flow of H2, using a programmed increase of the temper- ature from r.t. up to 450 8C. A solution of 10 wt.% naphthalene (analytical grade) in n-heptane was fed using a HPLC Jasco 880-PU pump, in a gas flow of a H2/N2 mixture (if not otherwise specified 1:1 v/v).
Each catalytic test was performed for 5 h, collecting the products in a trap cooled to 10 8C after a preliminary period of 1 h, under the same conditions,to achieve a steady state activity. The quantitative analysis of the reaction products was carried out using a Carlo Erba GC6000 gas chromatograph, equipped with FID and a wide bore PS264 column (5.0 wt.% methylphenylsilicone, length 25 m, inner diameter
0.53 mm, film width 1.5 Am). The products were
preliminary and tentatively identified by GC-MS using a Hewlett-Packard GCD 1800 system equipped with a HP5 column (5% of methylphenylsilicone,length 25 m, inner diameter 0.25 mm, film width 0.25 Am) while comparing the experimental GC-MS pattern with those present in the instrument library.
A wide range of reaction conditions was investigated (temperature, contact time, H2/naphthalene ratio).
Furthermore, since all the hydrotreated feeds contain small amounts of sulphur compounds responsible for catalyst poisoning, the thio-tolerance of the catalysts

226 was also investigated by feeding increasing amounts of dibenzothiophene (DBT), representative of the S- containing molecules usually present in the industrial feeds.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties
The BET surface area (BET SA), the micropore volume (VA) and the total pore volume (Vt) were determined on the Al/Ce/Mg PILC before and after loading the metals and their reduction. As shown in Table 1, both the catalysts maintain surface area values close to those of the support (surface area and pore volume decreased less than 20%). In Figs. 1 and 2, the pore distributions of the investigated samples,determined by DFT method, are reported. The pore distribution of the support shows a sharp peak centred at 1.3 nm and a second one at 2.3 nm, and it remains bimodal also after the loading of the metals and the subsequent reduction in H2. The micropores and the total pore volume, show only a slight decrease. That,in the case of CAT1, is little more pronounced than
CAT2. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1, after the
title reaction, the BET surface area values of the catalysts show a relevant decrease (CAT2 more than CAT1). The main reason for the occlusion of the pores and the consequent drop of the surface area of the exhaust catalysts can be ascribed to a large tar deposition on the catalyst surface and inside the pores, favoured by both the high microporosity and acidity of the support.
Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for the titration of surface acid sites. It is generally accepted that ammonia is an excellent probe molecule for testing the acid properties of solid catalysts, since its strong basicity and small molecular size allow the detection of acid sites located even in very narrow pores. Therefore, the total amount of ammonia desorption after saturation allows the quantification of the number of acid sites on the surface. Ammonia TPD analyses show that the support has a lower total amount of acid sites than commercial hydrotreating catalysts (Fujikawa et al., 2000; Barrio et al., 2003) or activated clays (Flessner et al., 2001). The acidities, of the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as measured by this technique, are apparently signifi- cantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the catalyst composition. This behaviour is not unusual for supported noble metals on acidic supports and higher amounts, compared with the support, of adsorbed/desorbed ammonia were detected by other authors (Barrio et al., 2004; Arias et al., 2000) in similar cases. Nevertheless the quantitative correlation of these data with the acidity of the catalyst is not obvious because the possible occurrence of ammonia decomposition to nitrogen, detectable only by mass spectroscopy (Skotak et al., 2002) and of ammonia chemisorption, with not exactly known stoichiome- tries, on the surface of the reduced noble metal.
Furthermore in the case of the generation of the active metal sites by reduction of cationic species exchanged on the clay surface, the final surface acidity will depend by the evolution of the metal/support inter- action during the reduction step (Vicente and Lambert,2001). Thus, in this case a defined stoichiometry cannot be determined and the acidity values do not allow to draw exhaustive conclusions; however, it is noteworthy that for both noble metal containing PILC catalysts the values are about 20% lower than that of the analogous Pd/Pt on silicaalumina catalyst used as
