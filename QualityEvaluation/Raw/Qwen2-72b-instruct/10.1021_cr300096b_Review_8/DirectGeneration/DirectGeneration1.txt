The comprehensive analysis of Pt-3d catalysts for C═C bond hydrogenation involves a multidisciplinary approach that integrates density functional theory (DFT) calculations, experimental validation, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) to advance catalyst design and predict performance. DFT calculations provide insights into the electronic and geometric properties of the catalysts, enabling the prediction of their reactivity towards C═C bond hydrogenation. These computational predictions are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanisms and identifying the active sites on the catalyst surface. Experimental validation through spectroscopic and kinetic studies confirms the theoretical predictions, ensuring the accuracy of the computational models. Structure-activity relationships, derived from both computational and experimental data, correlate the catalyst's structure with its activity and selectivity, guiding the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalysts. This integrated approach not only accelerates the development of new catalysts but also deepens the fundamental understanding of the catalytic processes involved in C═C bond hydrogenation.
