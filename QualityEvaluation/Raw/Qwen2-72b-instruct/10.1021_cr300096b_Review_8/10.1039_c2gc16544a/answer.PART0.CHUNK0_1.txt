1.DFT calculations show that the Pt-terminated surfaces of bimetallic Pt-3d catalysts bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation. This is consistent with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, which have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. The enhancement in hydrogenation rates can be attributed to the presence of the Pt-terminated catalyst configurations in the bimetallic catalysts. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

1.密度泛函理论计算表明，与单金属Pt表面相比，Pt-3d双金属催化剂的Pt终止表面与氢和烃吸附物的结合更弱，导致优化的结合能，这是氢化速率更高的原因。这与TPD测量等技术的实验观察一致，这些技术已经表明，对于苯和1,4-环己二烯，PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂的氢化速率高于单金属Pt催化剂。氢化速率的提高可归因于双金属催化剂中Pt终止催化剂配置的存在。这种综合的理论和实验方法可用于预测氢化活性，并指导更有效的Pt-3d催化系统的开发。
