[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."
[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules."

1.DFT calculations by Goda et al. revealed that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds less strongly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than other surfaces. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions through TPD measurements, showing that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with high hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces have been conducted, and the results suggest that supported Pt3d catalysts will exhibit high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These predictions have been validated in reactor studies.

1.神田等人通过DFT计算发现，1-丁烯和1-己烯在Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构上的结合力比在Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面上的结合力弱。穆里略等人通过TPD测量验证了这些DFT预测，显示了DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能可以用作具有高氢化活性的催化剂的描述符。对1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能进行了类似的DFT计算，结果表明，基于结合能和Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构，相应的Pt3d催化剂将对这些分子表现出高氢化活性。这些预测已经在反应器研究中得到证实。
