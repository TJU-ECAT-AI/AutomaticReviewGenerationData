[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."
[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."
[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."
[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."
[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules."

1.DFT calculations by Goda et al. revealed that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds less strongly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than other surfaces. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions through TPD measurements, showing that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with high hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts, which has been validated in reactor studies.

1.神田等人通过DFT计算发现，次表面Pt3dPt(111)结构与1-丁烯和1-己烯的结合力比其他表面弱。穆里略等人通过TPD测量证实了这些预测，表明DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能可以作为具有高氢化活性催化剂的描述符。对于1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯在3d/Pt(111)表面上的类似计算预测，支持的Pt3d催化剂具有高氢化活性，这已在反应器研究中得到验证。
