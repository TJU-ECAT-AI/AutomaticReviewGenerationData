How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."
[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."
[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

1.DFT calculations by Goda et al. revealed that 1-butene and 1-hexene bind more weakly to the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure than to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, a trend similar to that observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions through TPD measurements of low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These findings suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations have been conducted for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. Based on binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to exhibit high hydrogenation activity for these molecules, a prediction that has been validated in reactor studies.

1.神田等人通过DFT计算发现，1-丁烯和1-己烯与次表面Pt3dPt(111)结构的结合力比与Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面的结合力弱，这一趋势与环己烯观察到的趋势相似。穆里略等人通过TPD测量在PtNiPt(111)上对1-丁烯和1-己烯的低温氢化进行了验证。这些发现表明，DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能可以作为具有良好氢化活性的催化剂的描述符。类似的计算已经对1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯在3d/Pt(111)表面上进行了。根据结合能和次表面Pt3dPt(111)结构，预测支持的Pt3d催化剂对这些分子具有高氢化活性，这一预测在反应器研究中得到了验证。

1.DFT calculations by Goda et al. revealed that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds less strongly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than other surfaces. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions through TPD measurements, showing that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as descriptors for catalysts with high hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts, which has been validated in reactor studies.
