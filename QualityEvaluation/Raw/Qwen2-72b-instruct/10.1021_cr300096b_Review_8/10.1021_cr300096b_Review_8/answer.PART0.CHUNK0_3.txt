1.DFT calculations by Goda et al. showed that 1-butene and 1-hexene bind more weakly to the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure than to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. Murillo et al. confirmed these predictions with TPD measurements for the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These findings suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used to identify catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar calculations have been performed for 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, and the results predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts. These predictions have been validated in reactor studies.

1.神田等人通过DFT计算发现，1-丁烯和1-己烯在子表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上的结合力比在Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面上的结合力弱。穆里略等人通过TPD测量证实了这一预测，即1-丁烯和1-己烯在PtNiPt(111)上的低温氢化作用容易发生。这些结果进一步表明，DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能可以用作具有良好氢化活性催化剂的描述符。类似的DFT计算已经对1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能进行了计算。根据结合能和子表面Pt3dPt(111)结构，相应的支撑Pt3d催化剂预计对这些分子具有高氢化活性。这些DFT预测已经在反应器研究中得到证实。
