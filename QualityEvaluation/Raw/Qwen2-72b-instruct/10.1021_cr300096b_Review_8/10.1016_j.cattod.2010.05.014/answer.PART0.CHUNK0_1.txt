1.The document does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does mention that DFT calculations have been used to determine the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on corresponding model surfaces, and these binding energies were found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity. This suggests that an integrated theoretical and experimental approach can potentially be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

1.该文件没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的具体DFT计算，也没有详细说明TPD等技术的实验观察。但是，它确实提到DFT计算已被用来确定1,3-丁二烯和原子氢在相应模型表面上的结合能，这些结合能被发现与氢化活性相关。这表明，综合理论和实验方法可能被用于预测氢化活性，并指导更有效Pt-3d催化系统的开发。
