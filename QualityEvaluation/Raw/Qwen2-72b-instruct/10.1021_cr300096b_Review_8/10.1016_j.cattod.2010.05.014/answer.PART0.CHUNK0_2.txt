1.The document does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were performed to determine the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on the corresponding model surfaces, and that the binding energies of the adsorbates were found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity. This correlation could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation catalysts with enhanced activity based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest.

1.该文件没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的具体DFT计算，也没有详细说明TPD等技术的实验观察。但是，它确实指出进行了DFT计算，以确定1,3-丁二烯和原子氢在相应模型表面上的结合能，发现吸附物的结合能与氢化活性相关。这种相关性可能被用来根据感兴趣吸附物的结合能预测具有增强氢化活性的氢化催化剂。
