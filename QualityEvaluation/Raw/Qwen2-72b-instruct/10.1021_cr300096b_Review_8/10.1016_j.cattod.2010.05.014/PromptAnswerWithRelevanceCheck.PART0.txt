How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

1.The document does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does mention that DFT calculations have been used to determine the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on corresponding model surfaces, and these binding energies were found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity. This suggests that an integrated theoretical and experimental approach can potentially be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

1.The document does not provide specific DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it detail experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does state that DFT calculations were performed to determine the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on the corresponding model surfaces, and that the binding energies of the adsorbates were found to correlate with the hydrogenation activity. This correlation could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation catalysts with enhanced activity based on the binding energies of the adsorbates of interest.
