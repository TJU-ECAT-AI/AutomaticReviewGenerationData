1. Introduction
The production of synthesis gas, H2 + CO, in the dry reforming of CH4 is an important process for chemical technology and has been the subject of extensive studies [13]. From the first comparative work it was found that on the basis of turnover frequency deter- mined on noble metals, Rh and Ru are the most active catalysts [4]. Attempts were also made to produce synthesis gas by the reac- tions of C2H6 and C3H8 with CO2. Whereas in the absence of CO2 the dehydrogenation of C3H8 was the major process, in the presence of CO2 the formation of H2 + CO2 came into prominence [510]. As regards the dry reforming of C3H8, Rh and Ru also exhibited the highest specific activity [5]. Kinetic measurements revealed a zero-order dependence in C3H8 and a fractional dependence in CO2 [6]. Many of the above cited studies revealed that the nature of the support plays an important role in the activity and selectiv- ity of different catalysts. The best example is Mo2C. Whereas Mo2C/ SiO2 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C3H8 [10], using ZSM-5 as a support the aromatization of C3H8 became the main reaction path- way [11]. Several studies have been also performed on the oxida- tive dehydrogenation of propane with molecular O2 on oxide catalysts [1215]. V2O5 containing catalysts proved to be the most effective and selective, particularly when C3H8 was in a great excess [14]. A great challenge was to avoid the over oxidation of olefins formed. The influence of several additives including Au/ TiO2 was tested [14]. Au/TiO2 alone showed a low activity, but mix- ing with V2O5, yielded H2 in larger concentration than obtained on either vanadium or gold [14]. Au/TiO2 was also active in the selec- tive oxidation of propane to propylene oxide [15].
In the present work the reaction of C3H8 with CO2 is examined over supported Au nanoparticles. As was discovered by several decades ago, Au in nanosize exhibits a surprisingly high activity in many catalytic reactions [1618]. Recently, we found that Au nanoparticles supported by n-type semiconducting oxides are very effective catalysts in the reaction of C2H6 with CO2 [19].
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Supported Au catalysts with a gold loading of 1 wt% were pre- pared by a depositionprecipitation method. Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4aq p.a. 49% Au, Fluka AG) was first dissolved in triply dis- tilled water. After the pH of the HAuCl4 aqueous solution was adjusted to 7.5 pH by adding 25% ammonia solution, the fine pow- der of oxidic support was suspended and kept at 343 K for 1 h with continuous stirring. The suspension was aged for 24 h at room temperature and washed with distilled water repeatedly, dried at 353 K, calcined in air and reduced at 673 K for 4 h. Al2O3 (Degussa) and MgO (Reanal) were applied as a support. 1% Au/ZnO (AUROlite) sample was purchased from Strem Chem. The gases used were of commercial purity.
2.2. Methods
For FTIR studies a mobile IR cell housed in a metal chamber was used, which can be evacuated to 105 Torr using a turbo molecular http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.01.029 0021-9517/ 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Infrared spectra were recorded with a Biorad (Digilab. Div. FTS 155) instrument with a wave number accuracy of 4 cm1. All the spectra presented in this study are difference spectra. The sizes of Au particles were determined in a transmis- sion electron microscope. BET measurements were carried out by N2 adsorption at 77 K. Catalytic measurements were carried out in a fixed bed continuous flow reactor made of a quartz tube.
The flow rate of reactant gases was 12 ml/min. The exit gas was analyzed by gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890) on a Pora- pak QS column. The carrier gas was Ar which contained 12.5% of
C3H8. In the study of CO2 + C3H8 reaction we applied a gas mixture
of 1:1 mole ratio. The selectivity for C3H6 was calculated as fol- lows: C3H6 selectivity = 3  nC3H6/Ri xini  100. In the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR), the heating rate was 5 K/min and the flow of Ar (TPD) and H2 (TPR) was 20 ml/min. The products desorbed or formed were determined by gas chromatograph.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
The main size of the Au particles in the Au/ZnO is small, 23 nm,and uniform. This value for Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 fells in the range of 210 nm. BET surface area of the catalysts used is as follows:50 m2/g for Au/ZnO, 170 m2/g for Au/MgO and 100 m2/g for Au/ Al2O3. All catalysts have been also characterized by X-ray photo- electron spectroscopic measurements (XPS). In the analysis of the XPS spectra we accepted the BEs of three Au states: 84.0 eV for Au0, 84.6 eV for Au1+ and 85.9 eV for Au3+. Binding energies obtained fell in the range of 84.184.3 eV suggesting that Au is in the form of Au0. Some characteristic data for supported Au are shown in Table 1.
3.2. IR spectroscopic studies
The adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO catalyst was performed around 215 K. FTIR spectra obtained are presented in Fig. 1A. Note that the gas-phase spectrum has been subtracted from each spec- trum. At 215 K absorption bands can be identified at 2981, 2967,2960, 2901, 2875 cm1 in the high frequency region, and 1472,1457, 1387, 1375 cm1 in the low frequency range. Heating the sample to 373 K, or adsorption of propane at 373 K led to a dra- matic attenuation of all bands occurred with slight shifts in their position. In the low frequency region the absorption bands emerged only at higher temperature. Absorption bands observed at different temperatures and their possible assignments are shown in Table 2.
3.3. TPD measurements
The interaction of propane with Au/ZnO catalysts and ZnO sup- port was also examined by means of TPD measurements. The sam- ple was kept in the propane flow for 15 min at 300 K, and then it was washed with pure Ar until it contained propane (15 20 min). TPD spectra are displayed in Fig. 1C and D. No weakly adsorbed C3H8 was detected, it desorbed very likely when washing the catalysts with Ar before TPD measurements. From pure ZnO the desorption of larger amount of CH4 with Tp = 773 K, and the release of smaller amounts of C2H4 and C2H6 also above 700 K were registered. In the case of Au/ZnO catalyst almost twice as much CH4 desorbed also with Tp = 773 K.
3.4. Dehydrogenation of C3H8
Conversion of propane on various Au samples as a function of reaction temperature is given in Fig. 2A. Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO exhibited a very slight catalytic effect even at 873 K. A much higher activity was found on Au/ZnO. The reaction started above 725 750 K and the conversion of propane reached 17% at 873 K. The catalyst exhibited a remarkable stability. To establish the contribu- tion of the Au similar experiments were performed with ZnO sup- port alone. ZnO also catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction, but the conversion of propane was much less, 8%, than that measured on Au/ZnO catalyst. The major products on ZnO and Au/ZnO are H2 followed by C3H6, CH4 and C2H4. Product distributions obtained on different catalysts are presented in Fig. 3. The selectivity for C3H6 formation on Au/ZnO is in the range of 8390%. On the catalysts showing a low activity the product distribution is somewhat different.
3.5. Reaction of CO2 + C3H8
Adding CO2 to propane caused only a slight increase in the extent of the reaction of C3H8 on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. CO2 enhanced only moderately the extent of the reaction of propane on pure ZnO used for the preparation of Au/ZnO: the conversion of C3H8 reached only 13% at 873 K. A dramatic increase occurred,however, on Au/ZnO catalyst. The reaction started even at 650 K.
The conversion of C3H8 approached 50% at 873 K (Fig. 2B). Similar conversion values were obtained for CO2 (Fig. 2C). The product dis- tribution also underwent a significant change. The reaction occur- ring between CO2 and C3H8 is indicated by the formation of significant amount of CO, which exceeded even that of C3H6. This is shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the CO, CH4 became the major pro- duct followed by H2, C3H6 and C2H4. The experiments have been repeated by three times using always a fresh catalyst. The conver- sion value fell in the range of 4550% and we obtained the same sequence of products with only a slight variation. The approximate error bars 3%. Note that we did not experience a decrease in the activity of Au/ZnO at 873 K for several hours, but it drastically declined when the reaction temperature was raised above 923 K.
The selectivity of C3H6 formation was the highest, 7075%, at 773 K. This value became lower, 56.3%, at 873 K. However the yield of C3H6 production considerably increased from the value of 67 (773 K) to a value of 2530 (873 K). A great effort was made to identify the formation of hexane and hexene, the products of dimerization of C3H7 and C3H6 species. Both compounds were detected only in trace quantities.

When the amount of CO2 is varied keeping the concentration of C3H8 constant, the extent of reaction of C3H8 at lower CO2 content decreased. An increase in the CO2:C3H6 ratio only slightly enhanced the conversion of C3H8 and altered only little the product distribu- tion. Results obtained are plotted in Fig. 5A and B. The apparent activation energies for the formation of different products have been determined on Au/ZnO in the temperature range of 763 823 K. Some Arrhenius plots are displayed in Fig. 5C. We obtained the following values: 105.5 kJ/mol for C3H6: 129.6 kJ/mol for CO:
161.3 kJ/mol for H2 and 186.7 kJ/mol for CH4.
The amounts of carbon-containing deposit formed in the CO2 + C3H8 reaction on Au/ZnO catalyst and its reactivity have been determined by
TPR
measurements.
The formation of methane, ethylene and ethane was established. Methane peak was found at Tp = 874 K, but its continuous evolution was experi- enced even above this temperature. The formation of C2H6 occurred in two peaks with Tp values of 841 and 1039 K, while that of C2H4 with Tp  872 K and 1118 K. TPR spectra are dis- played in Fig. 6.
One of the referees noted that the carbon mass balance is very important,particularly when the conversion exceeds 70%.
Although the conversion in our case was always below 50%, we cal- culated the carbon balance for all measurements performed on Au/ ZnO. About 611% of C was missing in average, which was Fig. 1.

59 attributed to the low reactivity of the carbon deposit formed in the reaction at 873 K.
3.6. Reactions of propylene
In order to find out the fate of propylene formed in the decom- position propane, its reaction with CO2 was also examined on Au/ ZnO. Propylene underwent relatively little decomposition over this catalyst. The conversion reached only 4.5% at 873 K. The main pro- duct was H2. Less amount of CH4 was also detected. Adding CO2 to C3H6 increased the conversion with few percents and led to the for- mation of CO. An enhanced formation of CH4 also occurred, which exceeded that of H2. Raising the temperature above 823 K caused a decline of the conversion of C3H6.
4. Discussion
4.1. IR spectroscopic studies
The interaction of propane with supported Rh [8], Re [9] and Mo2C [10] catalysts has been investigated before by means of FTIR spectroscopy. Adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO at 200215 K caused the appearance of intense absorption bands at 2981,2967, 2960, 2901, 2875 cm1 in the CH stretching region and 1472, 1457, 1387, 1375 cm1 in the low frequency range. The spec- trum shows a good agreement with those obtained on other cata- lysts at low temperature [2025]. These absorption bands are characteristic for molecularly adsorbed propane, and their assign- ments are presented in Table 2. Although the catalytic reactions of propane proceed at high temperatures (Figs. 2 and 3) changes in the IR spectra indicate the occurrence of a surface interaction at or above room temperature. As in the previously studied cata- lysts, the formation of p-bonded propylene, di-r-bonded propy- lene and propylidene is postulated (Table 2). These adsorbed species appear to be strongly bonded to the catalysts surface, as no change was experienced in the IR spectra even at high temperatures.
TPD measurements showed that a fraction of strongly adsorbed C3H8 remained on both the ZnO and Au/ZnO. It decomposed only above 700 K resulting in the formation of CH4, C2H6 and C2H4.

DH  124kJmol 1 1 is strongly endothermic and also equilibrium limited. Higher con- version will require either higher temperature or lower pressures.
In the case where the feed gas is only propane, the equilibrium pro- pane conversion is given by the formula Kp = Px2/(1  x2) with Kp the equilibrium constant, x the equilibrium conversion and P the total pressure.
From the supported Au catalysts examined only the Au/ZnO exhibited a moderate catalytic effect for the dehydrogenation of propane Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 were found almost inactive below 873 K. The conversion on Au/ZnO reached a value of 1718% even at 823 K. We notice that the conversion of the propane never matched with the chemical equilibrium at any temperatures. The amount of H2 is more than 2 times larger than that of C3H6. Note that we did not experience such a behavior in the case of pure ZnO up to 823 K, when the H2/C3H6 ratio was 1.01.3. This indi- cates that Au nanoparticles are responsible for the large deviation in the amount of H2 and C3H6. In the explanation of this feature we assume that a significant fraction of C3H8 underwent a complete decomposition to carbon C3H8  CH4  2H2  2Cs 2 and the C3H6 formed in the primarily process (Eq. (1)) also decom- posed further 2C3H6  2CH4  C2H4  2Cs 3 The fact that we found CH4 and C2H4 in the products supports the occurrence of these reactions.
The situation is different when CO2 was added to C3H8. While CO2 only slightly increased the conversion of C3H8 on pure ZnO (see Fig. 2), it exerted a drastic enhancement in the conversion of C3H8 on Au/ZnO. The amounts of all products found in the dehy- drogenation of C3H6 considerably increased. The fact that a large amount of CO formed clearly indicates the involvement of the CO2 in the reaction of propane. In light of the formation of products we can account with the dry reforming of propane

4 and with the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
C3H8  CO2  C3H6  CO  H2O
5 An interesting feature of the CO2 + C3H8 reaction is the produc- tion of a large amount of CH4, which was one order of magnitude higher than in the absence of CO2. We may assume the occurrence of the extended hydrogenolysis of propane in the presence of a large amount of H2
H2  C3H8  CH4  C2H6
6 However, C2H6 was not detected even in traces, which excludes this route of methane formation. In addition this route of CH4 pro- duction does not need the presence of CO2. A possible explanation of the extended formation of CH4 is the hydrogenation of CO2
4H2  CO2  CH4  2H2O
7 Supported Au samples, however, were found to be completely inactive for the above reaction below 500 K [26]. Control measure- ment performed on the same Au/ZnO catalyst used in the present study revealed that H2 does react with CO2 at 723773 K resulting Fig. 3.

only in CO and H2O. Methane was detected only in a very small quantity. Similarly, we found no methane formation in the hydro- genation of CO on the same catalyst. Accordingly, we may assume that CH4 is formed in the decomposition of C3H5 radical (see below, Eq. (11)).
In the explanation of much greater activity of Au/ZnO compared to Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO we should take into account that ZnO is an n-type semiconductor, while Al2O3 and MgO are insulating oxi- des. Based on the work function of ZnO (3.954.25 eV) and Au (5.3 eV), we expect an electronic interaction between Au and ZnO, e.g. an electron transfer from ZnO to Au particles at the Au/ ZnO interface [27]. This may result in the activation of rather inert CO2 on Au particles in the form of negatively charged CO2 . It has been demonstrated in several studies that negatively charged CO2 is much more reactive than the neutral one [28,29]. Recently,it was reported that n-type oxidic supports for Au are much more efficient in the reaction between CO2 and C2H6 compared to Au samples deposited on insulating oxides [19].
In light of this consideration we describe the CO2 + C3H8 reac- tions with following elementary steps. We assume that the par- tially negatively charged CO2 enters reaction with the stable hydrocarbons, C3H8 and C3H6, producing more reactive CxHy fragments C3H8  COd 2  C3H7a  CO  OHd 8 C3H7a  C3H6a  Ha 9 C3H6a  COd 2  C3H5a  CO  OHd 10 C3H5a  CH4g  2Cs  Ha 11 2OHd  H2O  O2 12 2Ha  H2g 13 Accordingly CH4 can be formed in the decomposition of C3H7 radical (Eq. (11)).
In the study of the reactions of CxHy fragments over metal single crystals in UHV it was found that a fraction of CxHy species is dimerized beside their decomposition [3033]. In the case of C3H7 hexane (C6H14) and hexene (C6H12) were identified. This pro- cess was more expressed on less reactive Au(111) [30,31] com- pared to Rh(111) [32] and Mo2C/Mo(100) [33] surfaces. In the present study we found no sign of the formation of these com- pounds. The possible reason is that the reaction of propane occurred at very high temperature, above 650 K, when the favorite route of the C3H7 and C3H5 is their decomposition.
We may compare the catalytic performance of supported Au in the CO2 + C3H8 reaction with other catalysts examined under exactly the same experimental conditions. A general feature is that CO2 markedly accelerated the reaction of C3H8 on all catalysts.
Over Al2O3-supported Pt metals the dehydrogenation of propane occurred at 823923 K with selectivities of 4055% [5]. The activity of the catalysts depended on the nature of the metal: on the most effective Rh/Al2O3, the conversion reached a value of 63.5%, and on the less effective Pd/Al2O3 this value was only 4.3%. These catalysts were found to be effective for the dry-reforming of propane to pro- duce synthesis gas at 823923 K [5]. Over Re/Al2O3 the decompo- sition of C3H8 sets in at 873923 K with selectivity to propylene of 4374% [9]. Adding CO2 to C3H8 changed the reaction pathway of C3H8, and the dry reforming of C3H8 came into prominence.
Mo2C deposited on SiO2 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C3H8 at 773873 K [10]. The selectivity of propylene formation attained a value of 3550% at a conversion of 2535%.
5. Conclusions
(i) Propane interacts with Au/ZnO even below 300 K yielding adsorbed propylene and propylidene.
(ii) Dehydrogenation of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 are lim- ited on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3.
(iii) In contrast, Az/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further increased the conversion.
(iv) The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n- type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2.
