1.Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.
The literature does not provide information on Fe oxide-based catalysts or their performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The study focuses on the catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C. Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO. Coke formation will limit the utility of either catalyst for dry reforming of propane in practice.

1.分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能，解释催化剂还原性和支撑材料(特别是在Fe2O3/AC中)如何影响催化活性，并描述涉及Fe氧化物红ox循环的建议反应机制。
文献没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或其在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能的信息。该研究的重点是Ru掺杂CeO2和Ru掺杂ZrO2在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的丙烷部分氧化中的催化活性和稳定性。当CO2用作氧化剂时，丙烷部分氧化的主要产物是CO和H2，两种催化剂在450 C以下具有可比较的活性。两种催化剂在CO2或CO存在下均未显示出可测量的丙烷至丙烯氧化脱氢活性的选择性。焦炭形成将限制这两种催化剂用于丙烷干重整的实用性。

The literature does not provide information on Fe oxide-based catalysts or their performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It focuses on the catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity. Both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. The surface morphologies of the two catalysts are very different and the particles sizes, and surface areas are different. Despite these differences, the activity of the two catalysts are the same below 450 C and comparable above that temperature. Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion. The low rate of dehydrogenation in the absence of carbon dioxide suggests that the chemistry is not identical to ruthenium on an inert support.

1.分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能，解释催化剂还原性和支撑材料(特别是在Fe2O3/AC中)如何影响催化活性，并描述涉及Fe氧化物红ox循环的建议反应机制。
文献没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或其在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能的信息。它专注于Ru掺杂CeO2和Ru掺杂ZrO2在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的丙烷部分氧化中的催化活性和稳定性。氧化物的还原性对催化剂活性没有显著影响。两种催化剂在300 C以下对丙烷无反应，300 C以上它们的活性几乎相同。两种催化剂的表面形态非常不同，粒子大小和表面积也不同。尽管存在这些差异，两种催化剂在450 C以下的活性相同，在450 C以上时可比。尽管掺入不同的宿主氧化物中，Ru金属负载量对丙烷转化率仍有最大影响。在没有二氧化碳的情况下，脱氢的低速率表明该化学性质与惰性支撑上的钌不完全相同。
