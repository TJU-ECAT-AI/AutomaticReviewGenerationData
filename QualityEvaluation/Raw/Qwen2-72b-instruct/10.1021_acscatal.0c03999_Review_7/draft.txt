1. The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanisms of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), with emphasis on the role of support materials and the superior activity of Fe2O3/AC.

Fe oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_7\], given their ability to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Among the various catalysts tested, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) exhibits superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_7\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, as evidenced by H2-TPR results, is a critical factor in its high catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_7\]. This is in stark contrast to Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts, where the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support retards reducibility \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_7\]. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and the subsequent reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2, is proposed to play a crucial role in CO2-ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_7\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings underscore the pivotal role of support materials in modulating the reducibility and, by extension, the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Future research efforts might focus on the development of novel support materials that can further enhance the reducibility of Fe oxides, potentially leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the redox cycle of Fe oxide and its interaction with CO2 could open new avenues for the design of more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP and related reactions. The exploration of alternative reducible metal oxides and their synergistic effects with Fe oxides could also be a promising direction for enhancing the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.
