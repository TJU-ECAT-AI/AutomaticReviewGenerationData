Fe oxide-based catalysts are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their ability to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Among the tested catalysts, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) shows superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, as evidenced by H2-TPR results, is a key factor in its high catalytic performance. This is in contrast to Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts, where the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support retards reducibility. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and the subsequent reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2, is proposed to play a crucial role in CO2-ODHP.
