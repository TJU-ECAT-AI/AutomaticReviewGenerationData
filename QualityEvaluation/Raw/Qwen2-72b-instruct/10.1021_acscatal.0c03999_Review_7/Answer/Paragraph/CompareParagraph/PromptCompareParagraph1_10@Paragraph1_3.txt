Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high performance, reducibility, and unique reaction mechanisms. Among these, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) has exhibited superior activity, highlighting the critical role of support materials in enhancing catalytic performance. The support not only provides a high surface area for the dispersion of active Fe species but also influences the redox properties of Fe oxides, which are crucial for the selective conversion of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The reducibility of Fe oxides, facilitated by the support, enables the formation of oxygen vacancies that are essential for the activation of CO2 and the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism involving Fe2O3/AC catalysts typically proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where lattice oxygen from the Fe oxide is transferred to propane, followed by the regeneration of the Fe oxide through the reduction of CO2. This mechanism ensures a continuous supply of oxygen for the dehydrogenation reaction, making Fe2O3/AC a highly efficient catalyst for CO2-ODHP.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
Fe oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7\], given their established role in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as ethylbenzene and isobutane. Among the various catalysts tested, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) has demonstrated superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with a C3H6 selectivity comparable to that of bare Fe2O3 \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7\]. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, as evidenced by H2-TPR results, is a critical factor contributing to its high catalytic performance \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7\]. This is in stark contrast to Fe2O3 supported on Î³-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts, where the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support significantly hinders reducibility \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7\]. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and the subsequent reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2, is proposed to play a pivotal role in CO2-ODHP \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The findings underscore the critical role of support materials in influencing the reducibility and, by extension, the catalytic activity of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. The superior performance of Fe2O3/AC highlights the importance of exploring novel support materials that can further enhance the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide catalysts. Future research efforts might focus on developing advanced support materials with tailored properties to optimize the redox cycle of Fe oxide, thereby improving the efficiency and selectivity of CO2-ODHP. Additionally, the investigation of alternative redox-active metals and their interaction with support materials could open new avenues for enhancing the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
