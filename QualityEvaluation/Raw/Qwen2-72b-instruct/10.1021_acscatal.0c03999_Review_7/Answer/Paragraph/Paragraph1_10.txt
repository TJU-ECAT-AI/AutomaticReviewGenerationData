Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high performance, reducibility, and unique reaction mechanisms. Among these, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) has exhibited superior activity, highlighting the critical role of support materials in enhancing catalytic performance. The support not only provides a high surface area for the dispersion of active Fe species but also influences the redox properties of Fe oxides, which are crucial for the selective conversion of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The reducibility of Fe oxides, facilitated by the support, enables the formation of oxygen vacancies that are essential for the activation of CO2 and the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism involving Fe2O3/AC catalysts typically proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where lattice oxygen from the Fe oxide is transferred to propane, followed by the regeneration of the Fe oxide through the reduction of CO2. This mechanism ensures a continuous supply of oxygen for the dehydrogenation reaction, making Fe2O3/AC a highly efficient catalyst for CO2-ODHP.
