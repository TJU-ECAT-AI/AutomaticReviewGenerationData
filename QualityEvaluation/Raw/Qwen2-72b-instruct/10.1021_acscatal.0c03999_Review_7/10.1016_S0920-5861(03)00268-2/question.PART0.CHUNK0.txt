Oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited comparatively higher catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes in the presence of CO2. In the dehydrogenation of propane, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 afforded nearly twofold higher activities than that in the absence of CO2.
The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures. Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small.
UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2. 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Surface chemistry of diamond has received much recent attention [13]. However, diamond or oxi- dized diamond as a support material for catalysts has not yet been exploited. Further applications of Corresponding author. Tel.: +81-6-6368-0865;fax: +81-6-6388-8869.

Diamond has long been chemically considered an inert material. One of the present authors introduced the thesis that the surface of the diamond behaved as organic substances in certain chemical reactions [1].
The diamond surface is expected to have possibility of chemical reactivities as an organic substance [3].
This led us to develop novel utilization of diamond as the material of a catalyst or as a catalyst support for chemical reactions [46]. 0920-5861/$  see front matter  2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2 150

The diamond surface is easily oxidized by oxida- tive acids such as HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc., and is also oxidized with O2 at an elevated temperature to form COC ether type structures and C=O carbonyl type structures [1,2]. The oxidized diamond surface is expected to behave as a carbon oxide for specified surface reactions such as catalytic, electrochemical reactions. Given that such reactions are controlled via the interaction between molecules and surfaces,the bulk structure of solids is comparatively less im- portant. The SiO2 is widely used for many catalytic reactions as a neutral support. SiO2 support has weak interactions with some metals and metal oxides and plays an important role in the yield of active reaction sites. The interaction of the oxidized diamond with metals/metal oxides should be weaker than that of SiO2 and may have unique characteristics.
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has con- siderable industrial impact, because it represents a route by which to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons [7]. At present, light alkenes are obtained by steam cracking natural gas and naphtha, and fluid catalytic cracking that occurs in petroleum refining. Effective and selective conver- sion of lower alkanes to unsaturated hydrocarbons is a current research target of chemical industries.
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes can be carried out thermally to produce molecular hydrogen as a by-product: CnH2n+2 CnH2n + H2 (1) However, the thermodynamics of this reaction in- volved endothermic reactions, so the equilibrium greatly favors alkanes at lower temperatures when the reaction is carried out under atmospheric pressure.
The equilibrium shifts to the left side by increasing a reaction temperature with excess steam as a diluent.
The following oxidative dehydrogenation of alka- nes using oxygen as an oxidant of alkanes has been proposed as effective in decreasing reaction tempera- ture.
CnH2n+2 + 1 2O2 CnH2n + H2O (2) However, several problems, such as the removal of the heat of reaction, control of the selectivity due to the production of undesired carbon oxides, and the flammability of the reaction mixtures, which may cause a runaway reaction, must be overcome.
Among the many catalytic dehydrogenation reac- tions, the weak oxidation capability of CO2 in the deh- ydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has been our recent focus [810]. Recently, several attempts were made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the coupling of methane [1113], and the dehydrogenation of ethyl- benzene [1418], iso-propylbenzene [19], propane [20,21], or iso-butane [22]. However, little discussion on the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of alkane, as follows, has yet been published.
CnH2n+2 + CO2 CnH2n + CO + H2O (3) In this report, we focus on the application of oxidized diamond as an extension of the previous dehydrogena- tion of ethane to the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alka- nes to C3C4 alkenes using CO2. We have found that the oxidized diamond-supported-Cr2O3 or V2O5 cat- alysts markedly promoted dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes to C3C4 alkenes under CO2. The oxidized diamond exhibited excellent potential as a support material for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Experimental
Commercially available fine-powdered diamond was used for this study. The diamond powder was washed with HNO3 to remove metallic impurities,then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. Before oxidation, to prepare homogeneous surface condi- tions, the diamond powder was first hydrogenated at 1173 K for 1 h under pure H2 stream. The hydro- genated diamond powder was then oxidized at 723 K for 1 h under O2 stream (O2:Ar = 1:4). The oxidized diamond is known to contain oxygenated species with COC and C=O structures [1,2].
Catalysts were prepared by impregnating aqueous solutions of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, NH4 VO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), Ga(NO3)3· 8H2O (Kishida Chemicals), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and (CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Indus- tries), to Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-4, the reference cata- lyst provided by the Catalysis Society of Japan), SiO2 (Merck), activated carbon (Wako Pure Chemi- cal Industries), and oxidized diamond (BET surface area = 12.6 m2 g1), then the impregnated materials were evaporated to dryness. Supported catalysts were calcined at 723 K for 3 h in air prior to the reaction.

151 The reaction was carried out with a fixed-bed flow type quartz reactor (i.d. 10 mm × 350 mm) at 1 atm pressure. Using 200 mg of a catalyst, 2527 ml/min CO2 (or Ar) and 53 ml/min of alkane (propane,iso-butane, or n-butane) were introduced at temper- ature ranges of 823973 K. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were heated in Ar. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography.
The surface area of the catalyst was measured by the BET method using N2 at 77 K with an automatic Micromeritics Gemini model 2375.
The catalysts, treated under different conditions,were analyzed by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spec- troscopy with a
JASCO
(V-550)
spectrophoto- meter.

Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature range of 873898 K. Thermal dehydrogenation oc- curred to give a propylene yield of only ca. 2.5% in both CO2 and Ar atmosphere at 898 K. Promoting effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga cata- lysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was two times higher than that in the absence of CO2 at 898 K (Fig. 1). Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over the oxi- dized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts produced mainly propylene (C3H6). The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst has been reported, and the ethylene yield was 22.5% with ethylene selectivity of 86.7% at 923 K [4]. In the case of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, dehydrogenation of propane was also promoted in the presence of CO2, However, sec- ondary reactions such as decomposition to methane,152

In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at 898 K, respectively. One of the characteristic features of diamond support is a higher propane conversion compared with those of other metal oxides.
Fig. 2 shows the results of propylene yields at 823 K on vanadium oxide catalysts loaded on several supports, in the presence or absence of carbon diox- ide. The support activity order at the reaction tem- perature of 823 K was oxidized diamond > Al2O3 > activated carbon > SiO2. The oxidized diamond- Fig. 2.

Composition of the feed gas: C3H8:CO2(Ar) = 3:27. of carbon dioxide over oxidized diamond-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, propylene yields remark- ably increased with increasing reaction tempera- ture, and 13.8% of propylene yield was obtained at 923 K. In addition, CO was formed during the temperature-programmed reaction with CO2 after the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst.
In the dehydrogenation of alkane, carbon deposition is one of the serious problems. In the dehydrogena- tion of alkane over the oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, carbon deposition was observed. Notably, Fig. 3. Effect of temperature on the conversion of C3H8 over V (5 wt.%)/oxidized diamond catalyst. Reaction time: 0.5 h; C3H8: CO2(Ar) = 3:27 (ml/ml); catalyst = 200 mg; SV = 9000 h1 ml/ g-cat. the carbon deposition in the presence of CO2 was less than that in the absence of CO2.
In dehydrogenation under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows:
CO2 + H2 CO + H2O
(4)
CO2 + C 2CO
(5) Therefore, two possible explanations for the increased conversion of dehydrogenation reaction in the pres- ence of CO2 are plausible. One is that the removal of hydrogen from products shifts equilibrium (reaction (4)), and the other is that elimination of deposited carbon (reaction (5)) occurs. Similar tendencies were observed with Cr2O3 and V2O5-loaded catalysts. De- hydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 using the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts was noticeably promoted by increas- ing the reaction temperature. Under Ar atmosphere at 923 K, C3H8 conversion showed the same value as that of thermal reaction.
At 823 K no significant effect of loading level of V2O5 was observed on the propane conversion and propylene yield.
In the dehydrogenation of propane under CO2, ox- idized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts afforded higher C3H6 conversions. It is considered that the CO2 played a role in the shift of equilibrium and in the elimination of deposited carbon.

Small promoting effects of CO2 on the n-butane conversion were observed upon the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 catalysts. Dehy- drogenation of n-butane in the presence CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst produced mainly trans-2-butene, CO, and H2.
Fig. 5 shows the results of the iso-butene yield at 873 K in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2. The order of activity of various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 873 K was as fol- lows: V2O5 = Cr2O3 > Ga2O3 > ZnO > ZrO2 > Fe2O3. A very small promoting effect of CO2 on the iso-butane conversion was observed upon the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst.
In the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 atmo- sphere, a large promoting effect on the ethylene yield was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst [4]. However, the promoting effect of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes under a CO2 atmosphere was small compared with that in the dehydrogenation of ethane. The weak promoting effect of CO2 atmosphere in the cases of C3 and C4 alkanes might be ascribed to the fact that lower reaction temperatures were applied in order to obtain considerable conversions, since the bond disso- ciation energy of CH2 or CH groups in propane, bu- tane, and iso-butane are lower than that of CH3 in ethane. In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane,the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields.
3.3. UV-Vis characterization of oxidized
diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts In order to understand the role that CO2 plays in relation to the catalyst surface or oxidation states of catalysts in the dehydrogenation reactions, UV-Vis measurements were carried out. Fig. 6 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr (5 wt.%) catalyst. For the fresh catalyst, four peaks appeared, one each at about 275,370, 460, and 600 nm. The peaks of 275 and 370 nm

corresponded to Cr6+, and the peaks of 460 and 600 nm to Cr3+ [23,24]. From these results, the fresh catalyst had both valency states of Cr6+ and Cr3+.
The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as com- pared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a higher oxidation state. Wang reported on the dehy- drogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 over Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst and found that Cr3+ and Cr6+ coexist on the surface of the catalyst. They proposed that the redox property played an important role in the dehydrogenation of alkane under a CO2 atmosphere [25].
Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spec- tra of the oxidized diamond-supported V (5 wt.%) cat- alyst. Fresh catalyst exhibited absorptions at around 270 and 400 nm. The peaks of 270 and 400 nm indi- cated the presence of tetrahedral V5+ species [18,26].
Both of the catalysts used in the presence and ab- sence of CO2 exhibited absorptions at 270 and 400 nm,and in addition to these, a very broad new peak at around 600 nm appeared. This peak corresponded to V4+ [18,26]. It is obvious that the reduction of the vanadium species during dehydrogenation of propane Fig. 7. UV spectra of V (5 wt.%)/oxidized diamond catalysts before and after dehydrogenation of propane: (a) fresh; (b) after reaction with CO2 flow; (c) after reaction with Ar flow. occurred in both the presence and absence of CO2.
However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of
CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized
vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2.
The oxidized diamond-supported V (5 wt.%) cat- alyst did not afford a high ethylene yield in the dehydrogenation of ethane [4]. However, it exhibited high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes. In general, it seems to be difficult to maintain a high valency state of vanadium oxides at higher temperatures under a low oxygen partial pres- sure. Dehydrogenation of ethane over the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst was carried out above 923 K [4]. In contrast, dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported catalysts was mainly carried out under 893 K. There- fore, the vanadium oxide in the high oxidation states was maintained due to lower reaction temperatures,and the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst could produce high catalytic activities.
We propose that maintenance of the higher oxida- tion state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic

157 activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2.
4. Conclusion
Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the pres- ence of CO2. A support effect of oxidized diamond for Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts was observed in the presence of CO2. Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature.
The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher ox- idation state of chromium and vanadium species.
