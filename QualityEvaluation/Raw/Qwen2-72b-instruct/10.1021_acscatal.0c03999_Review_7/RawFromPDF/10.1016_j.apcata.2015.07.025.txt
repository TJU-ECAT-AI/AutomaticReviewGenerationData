Abstract 
 
Ethylbenzene (EB) dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 was 
investigated over CeO2 catalysts of distinct morphologies: cubes, rods and particles. 
The presence of CO2 resulted in prolonged catalyst activity and higher initial benzene 
selectivity compared to the absence of CO2. However, CO2 had no effect on the 
catalytic activity of ceria catalysts after stabilization. CeO2 cubes exhibited about two 
times higher activity per m2 compared to rods and particles, independent of presence 
or absence of CO2. Product distribution and Raman spectroscopy characterization of 
the spent catalysts suggested that superior catalytic activity of CeO2 cubes originates 
from the enhanced amount of lattice oxygen species that can be extracted by EB on 
the (100) crystal planes of ceria cubes, contrary to highly intrinsically stable (111) 
crystal planes predominantly exposed on rods and particles. We suggest that these 
O species are consumed in nonselective EB conversion pathways, generating partly-
reduced surface sites, which are suggested to act as active sites for selective styrene 
formation.

1. 
Introduction   
Styrene molecule (Sty) is a main building block for various polymers: polystyrene, 
styrene-butadiene rubber, styrene-acrylonitrile and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
 
[1]. It is commercially produced by dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) in 
presence of excess steam acting as: heat supplier, diluent and coke gasifier. The use 
of steam is highly energy consuming, and several alternatives to steam have been 
studied [2]. CO2 is considered as a promising soft oxidant that could replace steam in 
the EB dehydrogenation (EBDH) [3,4,5,6]. CO2 addition requires less dilution 
compared to steam due to its high heat capacity. Thermodynamic coupling with 
reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is proposed to increase the Sty yield at 
equilibrium [7]. Moreover, CO2 shows considerable activity for coke gasification [8] 
and limited catalyst deactivation with CO2 has been also suggested.  
EBDH in presence of CO2 has been proposed to proceed via Mars van Krevelen 
mechanism initially for vanadia based catalysts and later also for other oxide 
catalysts [9]. The participation of lattice oxygen species in EB dehydrogenation in 
presence and absence of CO2 was experimentally demonstrated by transient studies 
on Cr, V, Fe oxides supported on activated carbon (AC), MgO, alumina and 
powdered diamond [10].  CO2 is proposed to dissociate at oxygen vacant sites to 
form CO and active O, filling the oxygen vacancy and providing active oxygen for the 
dehydrogenation reaction [ 3, 9,10]. The relation between the amount of extracted 
oxygen species on Sb promoted V2O5 supported on alumina and its catalytic activity 
in EBDH in presence of CO2 has been demonstrated using transient experimental 
studies [11].  
There is ample evidence in literature that ceria acts via Mars-van Krevelen 
mechanism [12] in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. EBDH has been studied on 
cerium oxide nanocrystals in the presence of oxidants such as oxygen [13] and N2O 
[14]. Supported ceria particles on SBA-15 were reported as a catalysts of prominent 
activity in EBDH with CO2 [15].  
Ceria gained particular attention as a catalyst with unique redox properties and high 
oxygen storage capacity (OSC), i.e. the ability to reversibly store and release oxygen 
while switching between Ce4+ and Ce3+ in a stable fluorite lattice [16]. Distinct ceria 
morphologies are known to stabilize specific crystal plane orientations. Recent work 
in our group reported that relative inactive (111) crystal planes are predominantly 
exposed at the surface of ceria rods in accordance with other reports [17], while 
highly reactive (110) crystal planes are stabilized at the surface of ceria cubes [18]. 
Theoretical studies have shown that the formation of oxygen vacancies on (110) and 
(100) crystal planes of CeO2 is more favourable compared to (111) planes [19,20]. 
Therefore, catalytic activity can be accomplished [21] by manipulating the ceria 
morphology and hence the preferential exposure of the desired crystal planes as 
intrinsic redox chemistry on CeO2 surface depends on exposure of specific planes. 
Many research groups took this advantage to manufacture materials with tailored 
catalytic properties [22,23,24]. Ceria rods for instance were emphasised as a 
morphology promising for CO oxidation[ 24], and 1,2 dichlorethane and ethyl acetate 
oxidation [25], while ceria nano spheres showed better performances than ceria rods 
for NO reduction [26]. Prominent activity of ceria cubes compared to rods and 
particles for WGS reaction has been recently reported by our group [18]. 
Ceria cubes are known to possess enhanced OSC [27,28]. In our previous study we 
reported that CeZrOx cubes exhibited prominent activity compared to the catalysts of 
spherical geometry in EBDH [29]. This was ascribed to altered reactivity of oxygen 
vacancies when morphology was changed from cubic to octahedral (spherical). The 
aim of this study is to further address the effect of morphology using pure ceria 
catalysts, comparing rods with cubes and particles in EBDH, as well as to address 
the effect of CO2 addition. 
 
2. Experimental   
2.1 
 Materials 
Commercially available NaOH pellets (Merck, 99%), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99% 
Aldrich) and Ce(OH)4 (Merck, 99%) were used for catalyst synthesis. 
 
2.2 Catalyst preparation 
Cerium oxide rods and cubes were prepared modifying the synthesis procedure 
reported elsewhere [17, 30]. In the preparation of ceria rods 1.75g of Ce(NO3)4·6H2O 
was first dissolved in 11 ml of distilled water. The mixture was rapidly added to 10 
mass% NaOH aq solution. Ceria cubes have been prepared performing the mixing 
vice versa [30]. The resulting mixtures were stirred for 10 min (250 rpm), transferred 
into an autoclave (125 ml) and kept for 18 hrs in an oven at 130°C. Thus obtained 
precipitates were centrifuged at room temperature, rinsed with distilled water until 
pH=7 was obtained and dried overnight at 110°C. Calcination was finally performed 
in flowing synthetic air at 650°C for 5 hrs. Irregularly shaped ceria catalyst was 
obtained by calcining commercial Ce(OH)4 under identical conditions.    
 
2.3 Catalyst characterization 
 
Catalysts surface area (BET) was determined by N2-adsorption isotherm obtained at 
77K (Micromeritics Tristar). The samples were outgassed in vacuum at 200°C for 24h 
prior to analysis.  
Catalyst morphology was studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy, (SEM) LEO 
1550 FEG-SEM equipped with in-lens detector. Transmission electronic microscopy 
(TEM) images were obtained on a Philips CM300ST-FEG electron microscope 
operated at an acceleration voltage of 300kV. Samples for TEM measurements were 
ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and subsequently droplets of the suspension were 
deposited on a copper grid coated with carbon.  
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using PANalytical X´pert-APD powder 
diffractometer equipped with a position sensitive detector analyses over the 2θ-range 
between 25° and 65° using Cu K α radiation, λ=0.1544 nm. 
Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed with a Senterra Bruker 
instrument, equipped with a cooled CCD detector. The spectra of the fresh ceria 
catalysts were recorded at λ=532nm, with 2s integration time and 20 co-additions, 
10mW laser power and at a resolution of 9-15 cm-1. Spent catalysts (after 5 hrs time 
on stream) were studied with lower laser power of 2mW and longer (10s) integration 
time to prevent damage of the carbonaceous deposits. 
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TG, Mettler Toledo) was performed in flowing air. 
Typically 10mg of the sample was pretreated at 125°C for 30 min prior to gradual 
temperature increase from room temperature till 800°C with the temperature ramp 10 
°C·min-1.     
 
2.4 Catalytic testing      
Catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure and isothermal conditions 
(560˚C) in a fixed‐bed quartz tubular reactor (4.0 mm i.d.). The amount of catalyst per 
run was tuned in such a way that Ethylbenzene (EB) conversion reaches 8±2% 
stable differential level after approximately 150 min time-on-stream (Table 1, 
Supplementary information: SI). EB concentration in the feed was 1 mol%, controlled 
via the vapor pressure using a double saturator. In the first saturator EB was 
evaporated at 35°C, followed by condensation at 23°C in the second saturator. The 
tests were carried out with and without CO2 keeping the total flow at 30 ml·min-1 
(balance N2). When CO2 was added, a CO2 to EB ratio was maintained at 7. Prior to 
the catalytic experiment, catalysts were pretreated in pure N2 (580°C during 30 min, 
followed by 560°C during 30 min) in case of experiments without CO2 addition. 
Experiments with CO2  were preceded with a treatment in pure N2 (580°C during 30 
min) and subsequently in pure CO2 (560°C during 30 min).  
Reaction products were analyzed by on-line GC Varian-450 equipped with TCD and 
FID detector and four columns: Hayesep T, Hayesep Q, Molsieve 13X and CP-Wax. 
The experiments were reproducible with a typical overall error in the carbon mass 
balance smaller than 5%. 
EB conversion was calculated as the fraction of EB converted vs. amount of EB fed. 
Selectivity to styrene (Sel.Sty) is defined as the fraction of styrene in the total amount 
of aromatic products (eq. 1). In the same manner selectivity to benzene and toluene 
were calculated. 
 
Sel.Sty (%)= [Styrene]/([Styrene]+[Toluene]+[Benzene])·100%                   (1) 
 
Equilibrium compositions of the reaction mixture in case of simple dehydrogenation 
was calculated using equation 2. In case of CO2 addition the reversed-water-gas-shift 
(RWGS) equilibrium was accounted for using equation 3. Water has not been 
quantified in this study; it has been calculated from the mole balances as the 
concentration of styrene minus the concentration of hydrogen as suggested by others 
[31].

Equilibrium constants were obtained using HSC chemistry 4.0 software: at 560°C for 
RWGS: KRWGS=0,301 (inverse reaction is WGS: KWGS=3,318) and for the simple 
dehydrogenation KSD=0,08723.  
 
3. Results 
3.1 Characterization of fresh catalysts 
Figure 1 shows the TEM images of ceria catalysts obtained using the three 
preparation routes, resulting in rods (Figure 1a), cubes (Figure 1b) and particles 
(Figure 1c). Ceria rods showed the most open stacked structure (Figure SI1a), 
followed by ceria cubes (Figure SI1b) and finally ceria particles that are more densely 
agglomerated, without any distinct structure (Figure SI1c).    
 
Pore size distribution indicated that all samples possess a very small fraction of micro 
pores (Figure SI2). Predominantly, all three catalysts are characterized with the 
presence of meso pores. Particles have broad pore size distribution ranging from 3 to 
30 nm (with a maximum at 4 nm). Average pore size for cubes is 18nm. Pore size 
distribution of rods exhibited a complex pattern with four local maxima. Cumulative 
pore volume increased in the following order: particles < cubes < rods consistent with 
the BET surface area increase (Table 1, Figure SI3).  
 
Catalysts structure was further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure SI4). 
Dominant Bragg diffractions were observed at 28.8°, 47.6° and 56.7° 2θ, 
corresponding to respectively to (111), (220) and (311) crystal planes of the fluorite 
fcc structure of CeO2  [32]. 
3.2 Catalytic testing 
The ceria samples were tested for ethylbenzene (EB) dehydrogenation with CO2 as a 
soft oxidant, aiming at differential conversion after initial deactivation. EB conversion 
with and without CO2 is shown in Figures 2 a, b and c, for respectively cubes, rods 
and particles. EB conversion without CO2 rapidly decreased during the initial 40 min 
time-on-stream (TOS) (Figures 2a, b, and c) for all samples. The presence of CO2 
significantly slowed down the deactivation to a period of about 250 min TOS. This 
positive effect of CO2 on EB conversion is most pronounced for ceria cubes (Figure 
2a). After approximately 250 min TOS, CO2 has no longer any significant effect on 
the EB conversion. Further for all samples, pre-treatment with CO2 resulted in a 
significantly lower initial EB conversion level.     
Conversion of CO2 as shown in Figure 2d, e and f follows a similar pattern as 
conversion of EB. Initial CO2 conversion is about 10%, decreasing to about 2% for all 
the catalysts with TOS.  
Styrene selectivity with and without CO2 is shown in Figures 3 a, b and c. The initial 
selectivity to styrene was about 80%, independent of the presence of as well as 
pretreatment with CO2, and increased to approximately 98% with TOS for all 
experiments. Remarkably, this increase was retarded by the presence of CO2 for 
cubes and rods, whereas no effect of CO2 was observed for particles. Even more 
remarkable is the fact that, despite the very similar initial selectivity, the product 
distribution (Figure 3) was strongly influenced by the presence of CO2. The main 
initial by-product with CO2 was benzene (Figures 3 d, e, f) whereas initially more 
toluene was formed in the absence of CO2 (Figures 3 g, h, i). 
 
Figure 4 shows the amounts of hydrogen and CO detected in the presence and 
absence of CO2. Without CO2, the production of H2 followed the EB conversion 
pattern, while CO was detected only during initial 40 min time on stream for all 
investigated samples (Figure 7a-c). In the presence of CO2, H2 was detected in minor 
amounts after 30 minutes while at any time CO was found in significant quantities. 
The amount of CO produced when EB dehydrogenation was carried out in presence 
of CO2 (empty symbols Figure 4 d,e,f) is higher than the amount of hydrogen 
generated via dehydrogenation in absence of CO2 (filled symbols Figures 4 a, b and 
c). 
 
3.3 Characterization of spent ceria catalysts   
The amount of coke accumulated on the catalyst surface after 5 hrs TOS in EB 
dehydrogenation with and without CO2 was determined by thermal gravimetric 
analysis (TGA, Figure 5). The amount of coke deposits per g of catalyst increased in 
the following order: particles < cubes < rods. The amount of coke was about 15% 
higher after experiments with CO2, for cubes and rods. For particles the amount of 
coke was 43% higher after the experiment in CO2. The amount of coke per m2 
surface area turned out to be very similar for cubes and rods, and was about 25% 
lower for ceria particles, as shown in Figure 5b.  
 
The spent catalysts were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy. In Figure 6 
a-c Raman spectra of fresh catalysts are compared with spectra of the catalysts 
spent in EBDH in presence and absence of CO2. Spectra of fresh catalysts (full black 
lines) are dominated by a strong peak at 464 cm-1 from the F2g mode of the CeO2 
indicating fluorite lattice structure in agreement with XRD results [33]. Spectra of the 
spent catalysts are dominated with intense bands at 1335 and 1552 cm-1 indicating 
disordered and graphitic structure of the deposited carbonaceous species, 
respectively [34].  
 
Spectra were normalized per the most intense bands: in case of fresh spectra, 464 
cm-1 band in case of spent spectra: 1552 cm-1 band. 
Spectra details for the spent ceria catalysts in absence of CO2 :cubes (full line), rods 
(dotted line) and particles (dashed line) (d). Spectra details for spent ceria catalysts in 
presence of CO2:cubes (full line), rods (dotted line) and particles (dashed line). 
Spectra were scaled per 464 cm-1 band of the fresh catalysts for easier comparison. 
 
 
Figure 6d and e provide a magnification of the main peak at 464 cm-1 in the spectra 
presented in Figures 6a-c, comparing spent ceria catalysts tested in EB 
dehydrogenation both in absence and presence of CO2. When tested in absence of 
CO2 new bands evolved in the spectra at 368 cm-1, 410 cm-1 and 530 cm-1 in addition 
to oxygen displacement band at 258 cm-1 [32].  These are the most pronounced for 
spent ceria rods (dashed line) followed by ceria cubes (full line) and finally ceria 
particles (dotted line). 
When catalysts were tested in presence of CO2 (Figure 6e), ceria cubes showed the 
most pronounced new bands evolution (full line) followed by rods (dashed line) and 
ceria particles (dotted line). Remarkable, a very intense overall symmetric 464 cm-1 
band broadening in the range 258-410 cm-1 and at the wavenumbers lower than 600 
cm-1 was observed in the spectra of spent ceria cubes (full line). 
 
4. Discussion  
4.1 Effect of shape on performance after deactivation 
At any time on stream, in presence as well as absence of CO2, the rate of EB 
conversion, as calculated from the data in Figure 2, normalized per catalyst’s surface 
area is about 2 times higher for ceria cubes as compared to rods and particles 
(Figure 7). Similar trends have been reported by our group and assigned to the 
higher reactivity of (100) surfaces preferentially exposed in cubes in water gas shift 
reaction, compared to relatively inert (111) facets exposed at rods and particles [18]. 
For detailed surface characterization and identification of the exposed crystal planes 
for the three different morphologies, we refer to earlier work of our group [18]. Based 
on AC-HRTEM, providing resolution better then 1Å [24,27,33], it was revealed that  
mostly (111) surfaces are exposed at the surface of ceria rods and particles, whereas 
ceria cubes and expose mainly (100) surfaces. These ceria nanoshapes exhibited 
exactly the same trends in activity per surface area in WGS reaction as we report in 
this study (Figure 7) and elsewhere in RWGS reaction [30]. This is furthermore in 
agreement with the results reported for hydrogen and ethanol oxidation on pure and 
supported ceria nanoshapes [28,35]. Fundamental studies, though under very 
different conditions, report  that (100) surfaces are more reactive towards methanol 
[36], water [37], acetaldehyde [38] and acetic acid [39] compared to (111) planes. 
They reveal that (100) ceria thin films are more susceptible for defects formation in 
the lattice relocating the surface charge to attain stability [40].  
 
In absence of CO2 direct dehydrogenation proceeds, as indicated by Sty/H2 ratio of 1 
corresponding to the stoichiometry of the dehydrogenation (reaction 1) (Figure 8, 
filled symbols).  
 
EB → Sty + H2                                         (1) 
Addition of CO2 does not affect the rate of EB conversion in steady state, as can be 
seen in Figure 2 and 7. However, in presence of CO2 about 90% of the hydrogen has 
been consumed via RWGS (reaction 2, Figure 4) leading to Sty/H2 ratios far above 
their stoichiometric values (Figure 8, empty symbols). The RWGS reaction is not in 
thermodynamic equilibrium in the steady state (Figure SI5).  
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O                                        (2) 
 
4.2 Changes in performance with time on stream  
In absence of CO2, EB conversion rate steeply decreased within initial 56 min TOS 
for all investigated catalysts (Figure 2, Figure 7). Initially, catalysts are in a high 
oxidation state contributing to enhanced by-products formation and decreased 
selectivity to styrene (Figure 3). The product distribution (Figure 3) and the sharp 
decrease in EB conversion rate we attribute to the consumption of ceria lattice 
oxygen, resulting in mainly toluene (reaction 3) and benzene (reaction 4) both 
accompanied with CO formation (Figure 4), schematically presented in equations 3 
and 4.  
EB + CeO2 → Tol + CO+ H2 + CeO2-x                      
 (3) 
EB + CeO2 → Benz + 2CO+ 2H2 + CeO2-x                   (4) 
Further, a lower amount of Sty compared to H2 is observed in the first hour on-stream 
(Figure 8, filled symbols), indicating that styrene and by-products have been further 
condensed into carbonaceous deposits, as confirmed by TGA (Figure 5) and Raman 
(Figure 6a-c) results.  
From the integrated amount of CO produced during initial 56 min TOS according to 
reactions 3 and 4, we estimated the amount of lattice oxygen species extracted by 
EB (Table 2).  It should be noted that the numbers presented in Table 2 are based on 
the assumption that production of toluene and benzene is accompanied by hydrogen 
formation (reactions 3 and 4). Water formation was below the detection limit.  The 
amount of hydrogen expected to be produced according reactions 1, 3 and 4 is 
compared to the amount of hydrogen actually measured in Figure SI6 For ceria rods 
and cubes we obtained excellent agreement between measured and calculated 
values indicating that estimated numbers in Table 2 are correct and that water 
formation is negligible. In case of ceria particles, a minor difference between 
calculated and measured H2 is observed, initially. This may be attributed to formation 
of hydrogen containing species following benzene and toluene formation initially. 
However, we cannot rule out formation of water, introducing a minor error in the 
numbers for particles in Table 2. 
As shown in Table 2 the amount of lattice oxygen extracted per m2 decreases in the 
following order: cubes > particles ~ rods, resembling the order in the catalytic activity 
per m2 (Figure 7). We assign this to the presence of the highly intrinsically stabile 
(111) crystal planes exposed, the lowest amount of oxygen species has been 
extracted from the surface of ceria rods. Contrary, at the (100) crystal planes of ceria 
cubes with lower energy of formation of oxygen vacancies [19,20], approximately 
double amount of oxygen species has been extracted by EB per m2. The extent of 
reduction is relatively mild, although the amount of oxygen removed is exceeding 
somewhat the monolayer capacity (Table 2) [26,41]. Therefore, removal of oxygen is 
not confined to the surface, but sub-surface or bulk are contributing, as would be 
expected for ceria. As deduced from hydrogen balance (Figure SI6), surface lattice 
oxygen species initially participate in nonselective EB conversion pathways 
(reactions 3 and 4) while styrene formation follows a simple dehydrogenation route 
(reaction 1). The amount of styrene initially formed is below the thermodynamic 
equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction (Figure SI7) [42].As deduced from Figure 
7a and Table 2, more reducible surfaces (ceria cubes compared to rods and 
particles) exhibited higher activity for EB dehydrogenation both initially and after 
stabilization. We suggest that in steady state, oxygen deficient Ce3+-O-Ce4+ sites,  
generated upon removal of surface lattice oxygen species, are active for 
dehydrogenation of EB to styrene, as demonstrated previously [14]. Even in absence 
of an oxidant, oxygen deficient surfaces of ceria cubes exhibited higher activity 
compared to rods and particles (Figure 7a). We can however not rule out that the 
difference is caused by difference in surface structure of (111) terminated surface 
versus (100) terminated surfaces. 
Pre-treatment with CO2 resulted in a significantly lower initial EB conversion for all 
samples (Figure 2). This might be ascribed to the presence of carbonate [43] 
hindering both reaction pathways, i.e. nonselective EB conversion involving O 
species and selective styrene formation on reduced active sites. Strong interaction of 
ceria with CO2 has been suggested to inhibit the Ce/AC reactivity in EBDH with CO2 
in the temperature range 550-650°C [44]. However, the fact that the EB conversion 
profiles in absence and presence of CO2 are crossing each other, (Figure 2) suggest 
that these carbonate species probably decomposed in the course of the reaction. In 
presence of CO2, all the catalysts approached the equilibrium oxidation state in 
steady state slower as compared to in absence of CO2 (Figure 2). CO2 is probably 
partially replenishing consumed active oxygen species prolonging the time needed to 
reach equilibrium oxidation state of the catalyst in absence of CO2 (reaction 6) [9,10].  
Partial re-oxidation of CeO2-x with CO2 has indeed been reported before [45]. The 
creation of active oxygen species by CO2 dissociation to CO and O [11] apparently 
affects the product distribution, i.e. more benzene (equation 4) compared to toluene 
(reaction 3) has been initially produced (Figure 3). This was accompanied by slightly 
higher coke accumulation as compared to results obtained in absence of CO2 (Figure 
5), which seems reasonable because benzene is a well-known precursor in coke 
formation.  
 
CO2 + CeO2-x → CO + CeO2                                             (5) 
 
We further estimated the cumulative amount of toluene and benzene produced prior 
reaching stable EB conversion levels, to evaluate initial catalytic performances of 
these ceria nanoshapes in EBDH in presence of CO2 (Table 3). 
 
As shown in Table 3 the amount of toluene and benzene produced per gram 
decreases in the following order: cubes > rods > particles. When expressed per 
surface area, these amounts decrease as follows: cubes > rods ~ particles, 
resembling the trends in catalytic activity (Figure 7) and the order of the amount of 
extracted oxygen species by EB per m2 in absence of CO2 (Table 2). Apparently, 
there is a correlation between the amount of O species per surface area that can be 
extracted by EB and the integrated amount of by-products formed in presence of CO2 
per surface area (Figure 9). This suggests that formation of by-products proceeds 
according reactions 3 and 4, both in presence and absence of CO2 and that 
extractable O species also constitute active sites for initial by-product formation, 
which initially can be re-activated by CO2 in a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism via 
reaction 5 
EBDH with CO2 can proceed via either an one-step pathway, i.e. a direct oxidation of 
EB with CO2 (reaction 6) in a concerted manor, or via a two-step pathway: 
dehydrogenation (reaction 1) followed by RWGS (reaction 2) [46,47]. 
EB + CO2 → Sty + CO + H2O                               (6) 
First, we compare the measured amount of hydrogen with the theoretical value 
assuming that the RWGS reaction is in equilibrium (calculated with equation 3, 
experimental part). After an initial period, the measured concentration of H2 is higher 
than the calculated value at RWGS equilibrium (Figure SI8). This means that H2 must 
be a primary product and that RWGS is relatively slow, which seems reasonable for 
ceria, clealry indicating that a two-step pathway is proceeding. Likewise, the  
concentration of produced CO is well below the CO concetration calculated according 
the WGS equilibrium (Figure SI9).Therefore, CO cannot be a promairy product, 
proving that an one-step pathway (reaction 6) followed by WGS, can be excluded. 
In contrast, one step pathway has been reported as the main route over Na2O/Al2O3 
and V/Al2O3 catalyst, while over Fe2O3/Al2O3 both pathways have been reported to 
proceed [44,45,46]. Both pathways have also been suggested for V-MCM-41, Cr-
MCM-41, Cr/AC and Ce/AC catalysts [48,49]. It is not possible to rule out a minor 
contribution of a direct pathway in this study, but it is evident that the two step 
pathway via dehydrogenation and RWGS is the dominant pathway over ceria under 
the conditions in this study. 
 
4.3 Characterization of the spent ceria catalysts with Raman spectroscopy 
When catalysts were tested both in absence and presence of CO2, pronounced 
broadening of the 464 cm-1 peak has been observed due to evolution of new bands 
(Figures 6 d and e). In absence of CO2, this was the most pronounced for ceria rods, 
followed by cubes and finally particles (Figure 6d). In presence of CO2, the observed 
trends were in the order cubes>>rods>particles (Figure 6e). Broadening is known to 
be associated with expansion of the ceria lattice induced by formation of defects 
[50,51,52].  
Moreover, lattice expansion/ distortion as observed is in line with the evolution of the 
band near 530 cm-1, originating from the formation of oxygen vacancies. Bands at 
540-560 cm-1 and 562 to 599 cm-1 have been assigned to vacancies in doped and 
pure ceria, respectively [53,54]. Recently, our group suggested that shoulders at 404 
and 487 cm-1 arise due to formation of defects, as studied by UV Raman 
spectroscopy [55]. Without going into the depth, we used Raman spectroscopy as a 
finger print technique to detect the degree of reduction of catalysts after EB 
dehydrogenation. The amount of extracted lattice O species by EB in absence of 
CO2 (Table 2) correlates with the intensity of both 368 and 530 cm-1 bands (Figure 6 
d). Clearly, the intensity of both 368 cm-1 and 530 cm-1 bands increased with 
increasing amount of lattice O extracted by ethylbenzene (Figure 10a). The band at 
368 cm-1 is taken as a measure of the degree of the fluorite lattice distortion and the 
band at 530 cm-1 is a measure for oxygen vacancy abundance in the spent ceria 
sample.  
 
Further, the cumulative amount of toluene produced in presence of CO2 (Table 3), 
which is an indirect measure for the amount of extractable lattice oxygen as 
discussed above, correlates with both 368 and 530 cm-1 band intensities (Figure 6 d, 
Figure 10 b). As presented in Figure 10, the degree of reduction of ceria nanoshapes 
after EB dehydrogenation has a relation with the amount of oxygen species extracted 
in absence and presence of CO2. In absence of CO2 ceria cubes and rods have the 
highest reduction degree (Figure 10a), while in presence of CO2 the reduction degree 
induced by EB in spent ceria catalysts is highest for ceria cubes (Figure 10b). The 
fact that the order changes on adding CO2, may hint that the reactivity of CO2 with the 
surface of the nanoparticles may be structure sensitive.  Spent ceria rods in presence 
of CO2 exhibited bigger difference of relative intensity of Raman bands at 368 cm-1 
and 530 cm-1 compared to cubes and particles. This clearly indicates that the 
interaction of CO2 with the surface of ceria rods is different compared to cubes and 
particles. This may be attributed to differences in the surface structure, i.e. ceria rods 
possess higher fraction of surface steps, voids, internal pores compared to particles 
(and cubes) [18], or it may be due to clustering of vacancies as reported in [17].  
Although Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed ex-situ, and the 
oxidation state of the catalysts is very likely to change with exposure to ambient 
conditions, the trends in the degree of reduction are apparently still preserved. Also, 
deposition of carbon does apparently not mask the effect. 
 
Conclusion 
EBDH over cerium oxide catalysts of various morphologies, i.e. cubes, rods and 
particles, show similar behaviour.  Initially, oxygen rich ceria causes over-oxidation of 
EB, forming CO, benzene and toluene. Presence of CO2 increased the amount of 
oxygen species available via a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism, prolonging the time 
window in which by-products are formed, before reaching stable operation with high 
selectivity to styrene. Removal of oxygen is qualitatively in agreement with the 
formation of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortion as observed with Raman 
spectroscopy. After reaching stable operation, dehydrogenation is found to proceed 
via a two-step pathway, i.e. EB dehydrogenation followed by consecutive RWGS 
reaction in case CO2 is present. Cubes, having specifically exposed (100) crystal 
planes of low intrinsic stability provide more oxygen during initial formation of CO, 
benzene and toluene. In addition, in stable operation ceria cubes exhibited 
remarkable higher activity per m2 for dehydrogenation of EB as compared to rods 
and particles, suggesting that EB dehydrogenation proceeds on partly-reduced 
surface sites.
