New active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH) were
prepared by chromium incorporation in siliceous SiBeta. The Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts were ob-
tained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the ﬁrst step, removal of aluminum
from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta
support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous
SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation. The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and
propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined. Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta
zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the
dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties. Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high
selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter
hydrocarbons. Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence
of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,
while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative eﬀect on the rate of propene formation was observed.
1. Introduction
Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important
intermediates for chemical industry. Particularly, the demand for pro-
pene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the
chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses.
Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per
year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a
value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that
such high demand for propene won’t be satisﬁed by its current two most
important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in
which propene is obtained as co-products. Attempts at increasing pro-
pene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these pro-
cesses, will negatively inﬂuence the production of other important co-
products. Thus, selective processes dedicated solely to propene synth-
esis, such as propane dehydrogenation, oleﬁn metathesis, and propene
synthesis using methanol (e.g. MTP - methanol-to-propene), will gain
signiﬁcance with time.
Concerns connected to meeting demand for propene without si-
multaneously decreasing production of remaining valuable products
also favour intensiﬁcation of fundamental research. One of the crucial
research directions is the development of a new selective process of
obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehy-
drogenation
process
(PDH)
currently
used
for
industrial
needs.
However, this process has disadvantages such as reversibility and en-
dothermalness. An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is
propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or
propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared
characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-re-
agent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases
production
through
hydrogen
binding
in
consecutive
reactions.
Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of
propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be
attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to
propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the
main products. Some possibility of CO2-PDH integration with syngas or
propene required processes are proposed previously [2].
Many diﬀerent catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing
Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [5–16], Ga [17–20], In-Al [21–23], Fe [24] or V

[25,26]. Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are con-
sidered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and se-
lectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of
CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which
propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with
participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox me-
chanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an
oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [10,27–31]. In
the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/re-
duced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr
(III) has been suggested. It has been recognized that high dispersion and
presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving
high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH [18,27,28]. From above reasons
chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support en-
suring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered me-
soporous structure. Due to large speciﬁc surface area (in the most cases
above 1000 m2 g−1) of mesoporous materials like MCM-41, SBA-1,
SBA-15 or MSUx a high dispersion and concentration of chromium
oxide species can be obtained in comparison to unordered silica support
[6,9,10,14,18,27,28]. Others tested support, for instance γ-Al2O3,
which is commercially used for chromium dispersion in PDH catalyst
(CATOFIN Process) or active carbon are less useful. Over γ-Al2O3 sup-
ported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning eﬀect
while in the case of active carbon supported catalyst an application in
CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air [5,11,32].
In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a
catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon di-
oxide. Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure,
the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings
(0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels),
a high thermal and acid stability and a large speciﬁc surface area
needed for high chromium species dispersion [33–35]. We have shown
that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by
simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation
The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by
calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air
at 550 °C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000
was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solu-
tion at 80 °C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 °C
overnight.
Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step
postsynthesis methodwet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta
was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing
from 0.8 to 15.2·10−3 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was con-
tacted with solution containing 3.2·10−3 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.
Then, the separation of the solids from the suspensions were done in
evaporator under vacuum of a membrane pump for 2 h in air at 60 °C.
Finally, all materials were calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. The sample with
SiBeta contained 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 7 wt % of Cr were labelled as
Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta, Cr2.0SiBeta, Cr5.0SiBeta and Cr7.0SiBeta and
this with AlBeta, containing 2 wt % of Cr was labelled as Cr2.0AlBeta.
2.2. Materials characterization
Textural properties of supports and catalysts were determined from
the
low-temperature
adsorption/desorption
isotherms
using
the
Micromeritics (ASAP 2020). Priori to measurements the samples were
degassed under vacuum at 350 °C for 12 h. Total pore volume were
measured for the value of p/p0 = 0,98 and the surface area of the
samples were calculated from nitrogen isotherm data using BET and
Langmuir models. The micropore volume was determined using the t-
plot method.
Powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) analysis of supports and catalysts
were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 154,05 pm) in 2θ range of 5–45°.
Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by ad-
sorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before
analysis, the samples were pressed at ∼1 ton cm−2 into thin wafers of
ca. 10 mg cm−2 and placed inside the IR cell. Then, the wafers were
activated by calcination in static conditions at 723 K for 3 h in O2
(1.6·104 Pa) andoutgassed at 573 K (10−3 Pa) for 1 h. After the wafers
were contacted at room temperature with gaseous Py (133 Pa). The IR
spectra were recorded after desorption at room temperature and 423 K
for 1 h with a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer (resolution 2 cm−1, 128
scans). The reported spectra were obtained after subtraction of the
spectrum recorded before Py adsorption.
29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker
AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz.
Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were
recorded with a 4.2 μs excitation pulse and a 10 s recycle delay.
27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm
zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of
500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al,
respectively. An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution was used as second
reference to determine chemical shifts. 1H MAS NMR was recorded with
a 90° pulse duration of 2.9 μs and a recycle delay of 5 s and 16 accu-
mulations. A small-ﬂip-angle technique with a pulse of 1.2 μs (π/8),
0.5 s for the recycle delay and 2048 accumulations was used for re-
corded 27Al MAS NMR.
The total Cr content (CrICP) in the samples was determined using an
Optima 2100 DV (Perkin-Elmer, USA) ICP-OES instrument, equipped
with axially viewed plasma. In the typical mineralization procedure, a
sample (ca. 50 mg) was crashed and mixed with 2 g of NaNO3 (POCh-
Polish Chemical Reagents) and 2 g of NaOH (POCh-Polish Chemical
Reagents) in a melting pot. Then, the mixture was heated to 600 °C in
air. The mineralization mixture was cooled to RT, dissolved in deio-
nized water and ﬁltered. CrICP was determined in a dissolved solution.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and
reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out using
microreactor connected on-line with a GC equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector. In NH3-TPD measurements about 0.1 g sample
(mixed with SiC to constant volume 1,5 mL) was preheated under he-
lium (99.999 vol %, Linde) with heating rate 10 °C min−1 to 550 °C,
kept for 2 h, and then cooled to 100 °C under the same atmosphere.
Subsequently, ammonia (99.98 vol %, Linde) at ﬂow rate 20 mL min−1
for 30 min were adsorbed at 100 °C. The sample was then ﬂashed by
helium at a ﬂow rate 30 mL min−1 for 2 h. The NH3-TPD measurement
was conducted by heating the sample from 100 °C to 800 °C with the
heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
In H2-TPR experiments 0.1 g of sample dilute with SiC was ﬁrst
preheated in air ﬂow for 30 min at 550 °C and then in dry He
(99.999 vol. %, Linde,) stream for next 30 min. After that the sample
was cooled down in the He stream to 100 °C. The H2-TPR analysis was
then performed using mixture of N2/H2 (95/5 vol. %, Air Liquide) en-
vironment at a total ﬂow rate 30 mL min−1 and ramped from 100 to
650 °C with heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The H2 consumption was
measured using TCD and NiO (99.999 %, Aldrich) was used as a re-
ference for the calibration of H2 consumption.
Diﬀuse reﬂectance UV–vis analysis was conducted using an Ocean
Optics HR2000+ spectrometer (integration time 50 ms, 50 scans)
equipped with an DH-2000 BAL halogen-deuterium light source. The
spectra were recorded between 225 to 800 nm and barium sulfate (99%
Sigma-Aldrich) was use as a standard.
During selected catalytic tests carried out at 550 °C experiments
with the oxidation state of chromium species was monitored using
UV–vis equipment mentioned above (integration time 25 ms, 25 scans)
and a high temperature reﬂection probe (FCR-7UV400-2-ME-HTX,

7 × 400 μm ﬁbers). The probe was attached at the top of quartz mi-
croreactor within the distance of 2–3 mm from catalyst bed.
2.3. Catalyst evaluation
CO2-PDH reaction was carried out in a ﬂow-type quartz reactor.
Typically, 0.2 g of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–0.3 mm) was preheated in
a stream of dry helium (99.999 vol. %, Linde) for 30 min at 550 °C
before each catalytic measurements, and then the reaction was started
at 550 °C under atmospheric pressure. The feed consisted of a mixture
of propane (99.96 vol %, Linde) and CO2 (99.996 vol %, Linde) diluted
with helium. The volumetric ratio of CO2/C3H8/He = 5/1/9 was in-
troduced into the reactor at a ﬂow rate of 30 mL min−1. In reference
catalytic test without CO2 (non-oxidative dehydrogenation) the volu-
metric ratio of C3H8/ He = 1/14 was used.
The composition of the reactor exhaust was analyzed by gas chro-
matograph (Agilent 6890 N) which was equipped with a thermal con-
ductivity detector, Hayesep Q and molecular sieve 5A columns. H2,
CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8 were separated by Hayesep Q column
while CH4 and CO were separated using column with molecular sieve
5A.
Activity normalized per catalyst weight (1), conversion of propane

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Support characterization
Initially, AlBeta (Si/Al = 17) and SiBeta (Si/Al = 1000) were
characterized for clarify dealumination eﬀect on structure, texture and
acid-base properties. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystallinity of Beta zeolite
is preserved after dealumination and in the SiBeta support any extra
lattice crystalline compounds and long range amorphization do not
occur. The increase of 2 theta value of the main diﬀraction line after
dealumination from 22.5 (AlBeta) to 22.7° (SiBeta) indicates contrac-
tion of the Beta matrix, in line with earlier investigations (Fig. 1 inset)
[36,37].
Moreover, the dealumination leads to small change in porosity and
speciﬁc surface area. After HNO3 treatment the BET speciﬁc surface
area (SBET) increases from 642 m2 g−1 (AlBeta) to 724 m2 g−1 (SiBeta)
while the total pore volume from 0.52 cm3 g−1 (AlBeta) to 0.72 cm3
g−1 (SiBeta) [38]. In contrary to structure and texture changes the
dealumination has much signiﬁcant impact on acidity. The NH3-TPD
proﬁles for AlBeta and SiBeta are compared on Fig. 2A. In both cases
two maxima at 200 °C (LT) and 370 °C (HT) are observed on the NH3-
TPD proﬁles suggesting the presence of two type of acid sites, such as
Lewis acid sites related to the presence in zeolite structure of Al3+ ions
(maximum at around of 200 °C) and Bronsted acid sites related to the
acidic proton of SieO(H) eAl groups (maximum at around of 370 °C),
in agreement with earlier reports [39,40].
However, the intensity of these two peaks on SiBeta proﬁle is much
lower than on AlBeta proﬁle indicating clearly that dealumination leads
to signiﬁcant reduction of acid sites number.
Presence of both type acidic sites is conﬁrmed by FTIR investigation
with pyridine as probe molecule Fig. 3.
The treatment of AlBeta zeolite with HNO3 solution involve of
elimination of Al atoms from the framework evidenced by dis-
appearance of IR bands at 3778, 3661 and 3606 cm−1 related to AlOeH
groups (Fig. 3A), in agreement with our earlier investigation [41–43].
The appearance of narrow band at 3735 and shoulder at 3710 cm−1
related to isolated silanol groups and of a broad band at 3524 cm−1 due
to H-bonded SiOH groups in SiBeta reveals the presence of vacant T-
atom sites [41,44]. As shown in Table 1, the number of Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites decrease strongly when AlBeta zeolite is dealuminated
and only traces of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are detected in SiBeta.
To determine the nature and strength of acidic centres in AlBeta,
Cr2.0AlBeta, SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta zeolite samples, the adsorption of
pyridine as probe molecules has been performed. Fig. 3B presents the
FTIR spectra of AlBeta, Cr2.0AlBeta, SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta after ad-
sorption of pyridine at room temperature and after that desorption by
outgassing 1 h under vacuum of 10−3 Pa at 150 °C. The several IR bands
at 1637, 1622, 1610, 1546, 1490, and 1450 cm−1 are observed for
AlBeta related to Bronsted acidic centres (the bands at 1637 and
1546 cm−1), Lewis acidic centres (the bands at 1622, 1610 and
1450 cm−1),
Brønsted
and
Lewis
acidic
centres
(the
band
at
1490 cm−1). The bands typical of pyridinium cations are seen at 1545
and 1637 cm−1, indicating the presence of Brønsted acidic centres re-
lated to the acidic proton of AleO(H)eSi groups, in line with earlier
data [45]. The bans at 1450 cm−1 correspond to pyridine interacting
with strong Lewis acidic centres (Al3+). The band at 1490 cm−1

The 27Al MAS NMR of AlBeta zeolite posses 4 resonances (Fig. 4).
The signals at 54.8 and 52.5 ppm associated to aluminum atoms present
in two types of the tetrahedral environment of the framework. The
signals at −1.7 and −10 ppm correspond to aluminum atoms in two
types of octahedral environment. The ﬁrst narrow peak, could be at-
tributed to aluminum atoms in a tetrahedral environment near water
molecules and the second a large peak could be attributed to extra-
framework species. Due to dealumination, the 27Al NMR spectrum of

SiBeta zeolite (Fig. 4) present only one a small signal at −52.5 ppm
corresponding to aluminum atoms in the framework of zeolite [46,47].
The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of AlBeta (Fig. 5) shows two peaks at
–114.5 and −111.0 ppm related to two crystallographic sites of the
framework, Si atom in a Si(OSi)4 (Q4) environment. The signals at
−102.2 and −106.1 ppm correspond to two Q3 species, (OSi)3Si(OH)
and (OSi)3Si(Al) groups, respectively. 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of Si-
Beta (Fig. 5) is very similar to that of AlBeta. Only the signal at
−106.1 ppm disappeared as a result of dealumination [48].
The 1H MAS NMR of the AlBeta zeolite (Fig. 6) shows a broad signal
at 4.7 ppm due to bridging hydroxyl protons (Si(OH)Al). The small
signal at 1.37 corresponds to proton of SiOH groups. In the 1H MAS
NMR spectrum of SiBeta (Fig. 6) two main signals at 4.5 and 1.37 ppm,
related to the protons of hydrogen bonded SieOH groups present at
vacant T-atom sites and to the protons of isolated SieOH groups re-
spectively [49,50]. Two peaks at 7 and 3.22 ppm are attributed to
protons of water molecules and of hydrogen bonded SieOH groups
located in a second type of crystallographic site [51].
Moreover, dealumination leads also to signiﬁcant reduction of basic
sites number. The CO2-TPD proﬁles for both materials are reported on
Fig. 2B. In the case of AlBeta one intensive and a broad maximum ca.
200 °C (LT) with high temperature (HT) shoulder appeared, conﬁrming
presence of weak and medium basic sites which can be assigned to
desorption weakly adsorbed CO2 (physisorbed) and decomposition of
carbonates like species. In contrast, the amount of CO2 adsorbed on
dealuminated support (SiBeta) is much lower than that on parent Al-
Beta support. Two maxima with very low intensity at about 200 and
350 °C appear. The quantitative calculation reported in Table 1 in-
dicates that the total amount of CO2 adsorbed on SiBeta is more than 8
times lower than on AlBeta.
3.2. Catalysts characterization
Using SiBeta support the series of Cr-containing SiBeta catalysts was
prepared by wet impregnation. Based on AlBeta support the Cr2.0AlBeta
reference catalyst was prepared as well. Base characterization results of
SiBeta series are summarized in Table 2.
Chemical analysis conﬁrms good reproducibility of Cr incorporation
into the Beta zeolite. Both BET and Langmuir speciﬁc surface areas as
well as total pore volume drops gradually with the total Cr content
indicating that chromium deposition on SiBeta leads to porosity and
surface area reduction, simultaneously.
The decrease of the 2θ value of the narrow main diﬀraction line
around 2θ of 22.60° after introduction of Cr ions (Fig. 1) indicates some
expansion of the Beta structure and suggests that the latter are in-
corporated into lattice sites. The 2θ value of this diﬀraction line de-
creases from 22.71 (SiBeta) to 22.64 (Cr0.5SiBeta), 22.61 (Cr1.0SiBeta)

and 22.56° (Cr2.0SiBeta) which indicates expansion of the matrix after
incorporation of chromium ions into framework of SiBeta support. For
higher Cr content, the decreasing of the 2θ value of this diﬀraction line
is not observed (Fig. 1), so it suggests that for higher amount than 2 Cr
wt % the Cr ions are introduced in the extra-framework position of the
zeolite structure.
In contrast, the same 2 theta value of the main diﬀraction line at
22.55 for AlBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta suggests that upon wet impregnation
of AlBeta support with Cr(NO3)3 precursor expansion of zeolite matrix
do not occurred. It indicates that Cr ions are introduced in the extra-
framework position of Beta structure.
The incorporation of Cr leading to Cr0.5SiBeta, Cr1.0SiBeta and
Cr2.0SiBeta induces a reduction of intensity of the bands of silanol
groups, isolated and hydrogen bonded at 3735 and 3524 cm−1 re-
spectively (Fig. 3). Similar change has been observed for incorporation
of vanadium and cobalt ions into SiBeta suggesting that silanol groups
are consumed in the reaction with chromium nitrate and Cr ions are
simultaneously incorporated into framework of Beta zeolite, in agree-
ment with later reports [41,44]. In addition, introduction of Cr ions in
the AlBeta support leads to decreasing of Brønsted acid sites from
235.6 μmol g−1 for AlBeta to 227.3 μmol g−1 Cr2.0AlBeta and Lewis
acid sites from 134.8 μmol g−1 for AlBeta to 126.4 μmol g−1 for
Cr2.0AlBeta. For SiBeta and Cr2.0SiBeta only traces of Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites are observed.
The incorporation of chromium in SiBeta and AlBeta causes a de-
crease
in
the
signal
corresponding
to
the
(OSi)3Si(OH)
group
(−102.2 ppm), which suggests an interaction between the chromium
and the silanols of the zeolite (Fig. 5). The eﬀect is much more im-
portant on Cr2.0SiBeta than on Cr2.0AlBeta.
In presence of chromium, the signals of bridging hydroxyl protons in
AlBeta (4.7 ppm) and the signal of H-bonded SieOH groups present at
vacant T-atom sites in SiBeta (4.5 ppm) are very disturbed (Fig. 6).
These modiﬁcations are due to the paramagnetic properties of chro-
mium, which indicates a proximity between the species.
Furthermore, an oxidation state of chromium species in fresh sam-
ples was monitored using UV–vis diﬀuse reﬂectance spectroscopy
(UV–vis DRS). Fig. 7A summarizes the spectra recorded in the range of
225–800 nm that is characteristic for charge transfer (CT) and d-d
transition of chromium species. In all cases, in the CT transition region
two peaks at 270 nm and 360 nm are detected. These peaks are assigned
to CT of Cr6+-O2−transition in monochromate species attached with
support [52,53]. In the case of catalysts with 5 or higher wt % of Cr an
additional bands with low intensity in d-d region appeared (Fig. 7A).
These two bands are characteristic for spin-allowed d-d transitions of
Cr3+ [52–55]. Moreover, the band at 600 nm is asymmetric and has
two low energy shoulders ca. 650 nm and 705 nm, which are assigned
to spin-forbidden transition of Cr(III) (inset to Fig. 7A) [43]. The UV–vis
DRS results indicate that below 5 wt % of Crtotal on SiBeta surface
predominate Cr(VI) species while at and above this content Cr(VI) and
Cr(III) species coexists.
Presence of Cr(VI) species in fresh samples is conﬁrmed by H2-TPR
experiments (Fig. 7B). In all cases a single reduction maximum between
450 to 470 °C was observed. This maximum is assigned to reduction of
Cr(VI) to Cr(III) species [54–56]. However, over ordered and unordered
silica supports a deeper reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(II) may also occur
[27,28,56–58].
Quantitative results of H2-TPR (Table 2) reveal that the hydrogen
consumption rises with the Crtotal content indicating systematic rises of
redox Cr(VI) species concentration. However, the ratio of H2/Crtotal
drops from 1.46 to 0.81 as Cr content rise from 0.5 to 7 wt % suggesting
that with Crtotal content rises faster contribution of non redox Cr species
(mainly Cr2O3 amorphous and crystalline) than redox ones. UV–vis DRS
results (Fig. 6A) conﬁrm that above 2 wt % rise the intensity of the d-d
transition bands characteristic of Cr(III) species which are non-redox in
nature while XRD indicates α-Cr2O3 formation above 5 wt % of Cr
(Fig. 1).
3.3. Catalytic performance
Initially, the catalytic performances of all materials was investigated
in CO2-PDH process at 550 °C. Table 3 summarized initial speciﬁc ac-
tivity, propane and carbon dioxide conversion as well as propene yield
and selectivity to hydrocarbon products. The catalytic results for re-
ference Cr2.0AlBeta catalyst and several others Cr-based materials re-
ported in literature are summarized as well.

It is clear from Table 3 that CrxSiBeta exhibits high catalytic per-
formance, similar to other well know chromium oxide-based system
supported on mesoporous silica supports (SBA-1, SBA-15, MCM-41,
MSU-x) or active carbon. In CrxSiBeta series maximum initial yield 27.2
% was obtained on the sample with 7 wt % of Cr.
Moreover, it is clear that dealumination signiﬁcantly improve both
activity and selectivity. In the case of Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst, the
low selectivity to propylene is due to high concentration of strong acid
sites over AlBeta support which prefer cracking of propane. Thus, over
Cr2.0AlBeta in product predominates methane, ethane and ethene pro-
duced in cracking reaction.
The variation of propane conversion and selectivity to propene vs.
time-on-stream (TOS) are summarized in Fig. 8. Over all materials in-
vestigated conversion of propane drops with TOS, slightly for Cr-
containing SiBeta zeolite with low Cr content (Cr0.5SiBeta and
Cr1.0SiBeta) and much signiﬁcantly for Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite
with higher Cr content (higher than 2 Cr wt %). The selectivity to
propene variation has opposite trend than propane conversion. It is also
clear that in all cases the deactivation has not monotonic trend. It is
faster at the beginning of the process and slow down with TOS.
To clarify deactivation process the catalysts was investigated upon
catalytic test by UV–vis DRS. During the CO2-PDH process over
Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta the spectra were collected in two time
period. The ﬁrst period between 0–1 min and second ones between
1–240 min on stream. The Fig. 9 summaries the spectra collected in
these two periods.
In both cases, spectra of degassed in helium samples (fresh catalysts
before CO2-PDH process) have two main maxima at 270 nm and 360 nm

Simultaneously,

the dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,27,28]. Ohisih et al. [59] have
proposed redox cycle between Cr(II) and Cr(III) species in which CO2
acts as a mild oxidant. However, CO2 is very weak oxidant. As we found
previously Cr(VI) species reduced with CO selectively to Cr(II) species
are very slowly reoxidized by ultrapure CO2 (additionally deoxygenated
and dry) [62]. This may suggest that in the case of chromium-

containing SiBeta catalyst an oxidation role of CO2 cannot be re-
sponsible alone for observed promoting eﬀect.
In the second time period (between 1–240 min on stream) con-
tinuous rise of the intensity in whole range was observed that conﬁrms
a darkening of the sample due to coke formation. Tracking of the in-
tensity variation at 1000 nm indicates that darkening of the catalysts is
faster at the beginning of the process and slow down with TOS unlike to
propylene yield (inset to Fig. 9B and D). This variation of coke forma-
tion rate with TOS can be explained based on higher reactivity of
propylene than propane. Because coke is produced more easily from
propene its high yield leads to faster deactivation. Similar eﬀect was
observed in propane dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 [63,64].
Fig. 10 shows variation between initial propene yield (after 10 min
on stream) and hydrogen consumption (from H2-TPR) that is propor-
tional to number of redox Cr species for several various supported
chromium oxide based catalysts including also CrxSiBeta.
Over diﬀerent Cr-containing Beta materials the yield of propene rise
with the number of redox Cr species which on various silicas depend on
their pore structure and speciﬁc surface area of method of Cr in-
corporation/deposition as well as total Cr content. Typically, the yield
rises with the increase of total Cr content up to the maximum value
(monolayer coverage). After exceeding the monolayer coverage of
support the redox Cr species are no longer stabilized (attached directly
with support) and during the preparation there are decompose to less
active and non-redox Cr2O3 particles. In CrxSiBeta series linear pro-
portion between formation rate and number of redox species is ob-
served up to 2 wt % of Cr. After exceeding this content catalytic per-
formance did not correlate further with number of redox sites. In this
respect the CrxSiBeta catalysts exhibits quite diﬀerent behavior than
chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on ordered mesoporous si-
lica (SBA-1 or SB-15). In the latter case propane rate was proportional
to redox Cr species in wide range (between 07–13.6 wt % of Cr) while in
CrxSiBeta series the yield of propene reminds constant at and above
5 wt % of Cr.
Finally, the eﬀect of CO2 on catalytic performance was investigated.
Fig. 11 shows the variation of formation rate of propene, carbon
monoxide and hydrogen with TOS in the dehydrogenation of propane
in the presence and absence of CO2, respectively. The switching process
was carried out over Cr2.0SiBeta and Cr2.0AlBeta catalysts.
Promoting eﬀect of CO2 on formation rate of propene was observed
over Cr2.0SiBeta catalyst. In each cycle with CO2 addition, the
formation rate of propene was higher than in the cycles without it.
Similar promoting eﬀect was observed over chromium oxide-based
catalysts supported on diﬀerent pure siliceous supports, such as non-
ordered
SiO2
or
ordered
MCM-41,
SBA-15,
SBA-1,
MSU-x
[5,9–11,14,15,27,28]. Typically, CO2 addition enhances propene for-
mation in comparison with PDH carried out using dilution with inert
gas only [5,27,28]. Over Cr2.0SiBeta, in CO2 presence, rises formation
rate of propene and carbon monoxide while at the same time decreases
formation rate of hydrogen. It should be pointed hear that addition CO2
never stops formation of hydrogen. Changes of formation rate of pro-
pene and hydrogen in cycles with and without CO2 are similar sug-
gesting that positive eﬀect of CO2 on propene production is due mainly
due to shifting propane dehydrogenation equilibria via RWGS reaction.
A good catalytic performance of Cr-containing catalysts in RWGS re-
action was conﬁrmed previously [13,27]. The equilibria calculations
for two-step pathway of CO2-PDH process i.e. for PDH reaction coupling
with RWGS reaction and for single PDH conﬁrm that CO2 addition
enhances signiﬁcantly equilibrium conversion of propane [66]. Under
reaction conditions applied in this work (p = 1 atm, t = 550 °C and feed
with molar ratio C3H8:CO2:Inert = 1:5:9 or C3H8:Inert = 1:14) the
equilibrium conversion of propane rise from 70 % in PDH process to 89
% in CO2-PDH process [2].
Taking in count above and considering very weak oxidative abilities
of CO2 against reduced Cr species it can be conclude that over chro-
mium-containing SiBeta catalysts propene is produced mainly by PDH
pathways facilitated by hydrogen removing in RWGS. Propane oxida-
tive dehydrogenation (PODH) pathway has small contribution because
CO2 reoxidize very slowly reduced Cr species. Scheme 1 summarized
both possible pathways responsible for CO2 promoting eﬀect on for-
mation rate of propene.
It should be pointed hear that the promoting eﬀect observed in the
case of Cr2.0SiBeta is similar to those observed on Cr-based catalysts
supported on ordered or unordered mesoporous silicas. Over all these
catalysts CO2 addition enhance only partially propene formation
(10–25 %). Comparing to others catalytic systems, for instance palla-
dium supported on Ce-based supports the promoting the eﬀect of CO2
on Cr-based systems is moderate [3]. This variation of CO2 eﬀect with
catalyst can be explained by diﬀerent contribution of PODH and PDH
pathways. In the case of Pd/Ce-based catalysts a dissociation of CO2 to
active O species and CO over ceria-based support facilitated both PODH
and RWGS reactions, while over Cr/Silica based (or Si reach supports)

catalysts such dissociation is not pronounced thus propene is produced
mainly in PDH reaction.
In the contrast, over Cr2.0AlBeta reference catalyst CO2 exerts ne-
gative eﬀect, e.g. the formation rate of propene drops in the process
carried out with CO2. In this respect the Cr2.0AlBeta exhibits similar
catalytic behavior to CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst [2,5,11]. In the latter case
the poisoning eﬀect of CO2 was assigned to strong CO2 adsorption on
the surface of γ-Al2O3. FTIR investigation with CO2 as a probe molecule
have revealed that on the surface of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 carbon dioxide is
strongly adsorbed in form of carbonates which may limit dehy-
drogenation of propane [2]. The quantitative CO2-TPD measurements
show that amount CO2 adsorption on AlBeta is much higher than over
dealuminated form (SiBeta) (Table 1). This conﬁrms stronger interac-
tion of CO2 with AlBeta which may explain poisoning eﬀect observed
over the Cr2.0AlBeta zeolite catalyst.
4. Conclusions
Catalytic performance of chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts was
investigated in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in CO2 as-
sistance. Dealumination with acid nitrate leads to signiﬁcantly reduc-
tion of Si/Al module from 17 to 1000. This has great impact on catalytic
performance in CO2-PDH process. A comparative catalytic results in-
dicate that the promoting eﬀect of CO2 propylene formation was ob-
served on Cr2.0SiBeta. On this dealuminated form of Beta zeolite both
the yield and selectivity to propene rise in the presence of CO2. In
contrasts, on Cr2.0AlBeta zeolite catalyst CO2 exerts negative eﬀect si-
milar to poisoning eﬀect observed over γ-Al2O3 based chromium oxide
catalyst. Moreover, in series of CrxSiBeta catalysts a correlation be-
tween number of redox Cr species and catalytic performance was found.
