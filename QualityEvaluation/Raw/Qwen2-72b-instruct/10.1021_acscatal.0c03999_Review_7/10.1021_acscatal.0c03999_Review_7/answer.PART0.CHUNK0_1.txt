[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[5] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[6] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[7] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, known for their ability to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Among the tested catalysts, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) outperforms others in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC is a key factor in its high catalytic performance. This is evidenced by H2-TPR results showing that the reduction of Fe2O3/AC proceeds through Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, FeO, and finally Fe, unlike Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts, where the reducibility is hindered due to strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial in CO2-ODHP, facilitating the reaction through the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂，因其催化烃类氧化脱氢的能力而闻名，是CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的潜在候选者。在测试的催化剂中，负载在活性炭上的Fe2O3（Fe2O3/AC）在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面超过其他催化剂，与裸Fe2O3具有相当的C3H6选择性。Fe2O3在AC上的改善的还原性是其高催化性能的关键因素。这一点通过H2-TPR结果得到证实，结果显示Fe2O3/AC的还原过程从Fe2O3到Fe3O4，再到FeO，最后到Fe，与负载在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂不同，后者的还原性因Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而受阻。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP中起着关键作用，通过C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化成C3H6，随后由CO2还原被还原的Fe氧化物来促进反应。
