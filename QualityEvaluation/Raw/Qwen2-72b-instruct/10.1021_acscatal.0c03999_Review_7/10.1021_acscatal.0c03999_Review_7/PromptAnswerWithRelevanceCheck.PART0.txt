[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[5] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[6] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[7] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their ability to catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Among the tested catalysts, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) shows superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, as evidenced by H2-TPR results, is a key factor in its high catalytic performance. This is in contrast to Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts, where the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support retards reducibility. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and the subsequent reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2, is proposed to play a crucial role in CO2-ODHP.

Fe氧化物基催化剂由于其催化烃类氧化脱氢的能力，是CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的有希望的候选者。在测试的催化剂中，负载在活性炭上的Fe2O3（Fe2O3/AC）在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现出优越的性能，与裸Fe2O3的C3H6选择性相当。Fe2O3在AC上的增强还原性，如H2-TPR结果所示，是其高催化性能的关键因素。这与Fe2O3负载在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂形成鲜明对比，其中Fe氧化物与载体的强相互作用阻碍了还原性。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，涉及C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化为C3H6，以及随后由CO2还原的Fe氧化物的再氧化，被提议在CO2-ODHP中起关键作用。

Fe oxide-based catalysts, including Fe2O3 and its supported versions, are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their ability to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) stands out for its superior performance in terms of propane (C3H8) conversion and propylene (C3H6) yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe2O3/AC can be attributed to its improved reducibility, as evidenced by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results. This reduction process occurs through a series of steps: Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, then to FeO, and finally to metallic Fe. In contrast, the reducibility of Fe2O3 supported on gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support, leading to the formation of a spinel phase (FeAl2O3) that is difficult to reduce. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, facilitated by the improved reducibility on AC, is crucial for the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC in CO2-ODHP. The reaction mechanism is proposed to involve the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, acting as a soft oxidant.
