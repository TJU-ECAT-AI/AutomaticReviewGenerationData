[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[5] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[6] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[7] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their ability to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Among the tested catalysts, Fe2O3/AC outperforms others in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on activated carbon (AC) is a key factor in its high catalytic performance. In contrast, the reducibility of Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support, leading to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 that is difficult to reduce. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial in CO2-ODHP, involving the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂由于其催化烃类氧化脱氢的能力，是CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的潜在候选者。在测试的催化剂中，Fe2O3/AC在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面超过其他催化剂，与裸Fe2O3具有相当的C3H6选择性。Fe2O3在活性炭（AC）上的改善的还原性是其高催化性能的关键因素。相比之下，Fe2O3在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂上的还原性受到阻碍，由于Fe氧化物与支撑物之间的强烈相互作用，导致形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP中至关重要，涉及C3H8在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化为C3H6，随后由CO2还原氧化的Fe氧化物。
