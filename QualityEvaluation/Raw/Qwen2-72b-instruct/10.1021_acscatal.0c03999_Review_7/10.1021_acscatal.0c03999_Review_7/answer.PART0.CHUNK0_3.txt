[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support."
[5] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[6] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[7] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, including Fe2O3 and its supported versions, are promising for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their ability to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Among these, Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) stands out for its superior performance in terms of propane (C3H8) conversion and propylene (C3H6) yield, with comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe2O3/AC can be attributed to its improved reducibility, as evidenced by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results. This reduction process occurs through a series of steps: Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, then to FeO, and finally to metallic Fe. In contrast, the reducibility of Fe2O3 supported on gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is hindered due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide and the support, leading to the formation of a spinel phase (FeAl2O3) that is difficult to reduce. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, facilitated by the improved reducibility on AC, is crucial for the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC in CO2-ODHP. The reaction mechanism is proposed to involve the oxidation of C3H8 to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, acting as a soft oxidant.

基于Fe氧化物的催化剂，包括Fe2O3及其支撑版本，由于其催化氧化脱氢反应的能力，是CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的有希望的候选者。在这些催化剂中，负载在活性炭上的Fe2O3（Fe2O3/AC）在丙烷（C3H8）转化和丙烯（C3H6）产率方面表现出色，与裸Fe2O3具有相当的C3H6选择性。Fe2O3/AC增强的催化活性可归因于其改进的还原性，这在氢气温度程序还原（H2-TPR）结果中得到证实。这一还原过程通过一系列步骤进行：Fe2O3到Fe3O4，然后到FeO，最后到金属Fe。相比之下，Fe2O3在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂上的还原性受到阻碍，由于Fe氧化物与支撑物之间的强烈相互作用，导致形成难以还原的尖晶石相（FeAl2O3）。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，由AC上的改进还原性促进，对于Fe2O3/AC在CO2-ODHP中的高催化性能至关重要。反应机制被提议涉及使用Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，随后由CO2作为软氧化剂重新氧化还原的Fe氧化物。
