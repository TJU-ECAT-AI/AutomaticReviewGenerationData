Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

1.The literature does not provide information to directly answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, or the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. The document discusses the use of CO2 and N2O as oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over a Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, but does not compare this to redox-inactive catalysts or provide detailed mechanisms for CO2 activation. It does not specifically mention V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters, nor does it discuss energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

1.文献没有提供直接回答关于比较和对比在氧化脱氢烷烃中红氧化活性和红氧化非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制，或传统氧化剂和CO2的作用的信息。该文件讨论了CO2和N2O作为氧化脱氢n-丁烷的Ni-Mo/Al2O3催化剂的氧化剂的使用，但没有将其与红氧化非活性催化剂进行比较，也没有提供详细的CO2活化机制。它没有特别提到V2O5，VOx/SiO2，CeO2或过渡金属簇，也没有讨论CO2解离的能量障碍。

1. The literature does not provide information to directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the role of different oxidants, including traditional oxidants like O2 and soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O. The literature suggests that CO2 and N2O limit the formation of electrophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which can promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene. The literature also indicates that the use of soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O facilitates easier migration of lattice oxygen from bulk to surface to complete the oxidation process. The literature does not provide detailed information on the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane or the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

1. 文献没有直接比较和对比红氧化活性和红氧化惰性金属氧化物催化剂在烷氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制。但是，它确实讨论了不同氧化剂的作用，包括传统的氧化剂如O2和软氧化剂如CO2和N2O。文献表明，CO2和N2O限制了催化剂表面电荷性氧物种的形成，这些物种可以促进烯烃氧化为碳氧化物，从而提高丁二烯的选择性。文献还表明，使用软氧化剂如CO2和N2O促进了晶格氧从体相到表面的更容易迁移，以完成氧化过程。文献没有提供关于不同催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性，或CO2解离的建议机制和能垒的详细信息。
