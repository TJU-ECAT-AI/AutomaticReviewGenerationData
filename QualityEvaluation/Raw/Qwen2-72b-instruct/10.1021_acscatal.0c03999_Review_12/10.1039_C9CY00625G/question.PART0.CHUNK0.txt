www.rsc.org/ Catalytic halogenation of methane: a dream reaction with practical scope?
Vladimir Paunovid* and Javier Prez-Ramrez* Development of catalysts that could surpass the activity and selectivity constraints of the non-catalytic radical-mediated halogenation of methane constitutes a long-standing challenge, which holds great potential to valorise this readily available resource for the production of commodities. This study presents comprehensive performance maps of a large library of materials, comprising carriers (quartz, SiO2, SiC, -Al2O3, -Al2O3, carbon), noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru), metal oxides (Fe2O3, CeO2), chlorides (PdCl2, CuCl2) and oxyflourides (TaOF3) supported over SiO2, -Al2O3, carbon or H-ZSM-5 carriers,sulfated systems (S-ZrO2, S-ZrO2-SBA-15, S-TiO2, S-Nb2O5, S-Ta2O5, Nafion) and zeolites (3A, H-USY, H-MOR, H-SAPO-34, H-BETA, H-ZSM-5) in chlorination and bromination of methane under practically relevant conditions and gains insights into the nature of the catalytic effects as a function of the catalyst and halogen of choice. Chlorination activity of different catalyst beds at low temperatures (473-523 K) was 2-5.5 higher compared to the void reactor of identical volume, while the bromination rate was almost unaffected by the solids in the whole temperature range (643-723 K). Except for zeolites and Pt/carbon, which promoted polyhalogenation, selectivities to halomethane over most of catalysts were similar to those in the non-catalytic reactions and were higher in bromination (SCH3Br = 80-95% verusus SCH3Cl = 52-90% at XCH4 = 5-18%). The formation of carbon oxides (SCOx = 2-28%) over several materials in chlorination and virtually all systems in bromination implied the decomposition of halomethanes, which at higher temperatures led to cooking, particularly in the latter reaction. The kinetic fingerprints along with the marginal impact of Si:Al ratio, counter ions and extraframework aluminium species on the performance of the most active H-ZSM-5 catalyst indicated that methane chlorination over various materials is governed by the radical-chain mechanism, which limits the scope for breaking the selectivity-conversion relationships by tailoring the catalyst acidity. Nonetheless, the enhancement of chlorination activity over zeolites that followed a volcano-like dependence on their micropore size coupled with a more significant impact of the intracrystalline mesopororsity and crystallite size on the product distribution revealed the important role of confinement effects in this reaction, which may pave the way for the advancements in the production of chloromethanes.
Introduction The reactions of methane with molecular halogens (X2, X = F, Cl, Br or I, eqns (1-4)) constitute the earliest known routes to functionalize this astonishingly inert hydrocarbon, the history of which dates back to 1840 when the French chemist Jean Baptist Dumas reported the conversion of marsh gas by the action of chlorine (Fig 1).1,2 The extensive kinetic studies of these thermally or photo-activated halogenation processes performed between the 1910s and the 1940s led to the postulation of the radical-chain mechanism that was verified for all halogens and paraffins (Fig 1).3-11 The halogen radicals (X•) initially formed via homolytic bond dissociation of X2 and regenerated through the reaction of alkyl radicals with X2, play a central role in this reaction network. The differences in stability between the X•, which increases in the order F• < Cl• < Br• < I•, cause that methane fluorination is extremely exothermic and often explosive, chlorination and bromination display medium and mild exothermicity, respectively, and moderate activity, while the iodination is endothermic and equilibrium limited (eqns (1-4)).1 The differences in radicals reactivity induce substantial variations in the product distribution as a function of halogen, since the mono- (CH3X),di- (CH2X2) and threehalomethanes (CHX3) could react in analogue fashion as methane leading to polyhalogenation. In contrast to fluorinations which inevitably lead to a complete substitution, chlorination could provide a high selectivity to monohalomethanes if operated at a relatively high methane-to-chlorine ratio (typically molar
CH4:Cl2 >10),
although CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 are formed in significant amounts at close to stoichiometric feed composition.12,13 In contrast,methane bromination yields a high selectivity to CH3Br (>90%) at smaller methane excess (CH4:Cl2 >5), while polybromination is generally limited to the formation of CH2Br2.1

The industrial interest for methane halogenation already ignited in the early 20st century, when following a series of patents, the first industrial process based on non-catalytic thermal chlorination of methane was established in 1923 by Hoechst.2 After incorporating several refinements during its life-span, this remains the state-of-the-art technology for the manufacture of chloromethanes (mostly CH2Cl2 and CHCl3), the world-wide production of which is estimated to exceed 1.4 Mt year-1, with a market size of ca. 1,000 M$ (Fig 1).2 Although the latter chemicals are mostly used as solvents and precursors in synthesis of polymers and fine chemicals, as early as in the 1920s CH3Cl was recognized as an attractive intermediate to produce methanol and ethers by reacting it with oxides such as CaO.14 This concept was advanced in the 1980s, when George A. Olah proposed a disruptive halogen-mediated route to valorise methane, the main constituent of highly abundant and inexpensive natural gas, by mitigating the costly and energy-intensive syngas-based processes.15 The concept is based on a selective C-H bond activation using Cl2 or Br2 to yield CH3X, which are versatile platform molecules that can be readily coupled into value-added chemicals and liquid fuels via catalytic pathways that are similar to those of methanol (Fig 1).1519 The implementation of this technology is contingent on the full recycling of hydrogen halide (HX) formed in the halogenation and coupling steps, the ability to maximize the productivity of CH3X over polyhalomethanes and its coupling efficiency.1,20 The recent decade testified significant progress in HX recovery via cataloreactants systems,21-22 electrochemical and thermochemical

One approach to enhance the selectivity to CH3X is based on the use of a substantial methane excess in the non-catalytic halogenation, which, however results in a large CH4 recycle stream.1,12,13 Alternatively, the polyhalomethanes can be reformed by reproportionation with another alkane (eqn (5)),28-30 or hydrodehalogenation (eqn (6)).31 Still, the key to selective monohalogenation relies on mitigating the radical steps via an alternative reaction pathway that is facilitated by the catalyst. Although the early reports on halogenation describe the enhancement of reaction rate in the presence of different inert solids (e.g., silica and active carbons) as well as the CuCl2-based melts and fluidized beds,11,32 the fundamental landmark to this goal was set by Olah, who devised the concept of electrophilic C-H bond activation enabled through the polarization of the X2 molecule by the action of super-acid catalysts (Fig 1).15,33 This pathway displays an inherent propensity to CH3X as the addition of strongly electron withdrawing halogen substituents destabilizes the intermediate carbonium ion complex and hinders further substitution. The proof of concept was demonstrated using homogeneous SbF5 catalyst, but aiming to achieve more practical space-time yields, Olah et al. studied supported noble metals as well as solid-acid catalysts based on oxyflourides (Fig 1).15,33 The former systems were found active at low temperatures (543 K), providing unprecedented selectivity to CH3Cl (80-99%) and CH3Br (99%) even when a substantial excess of halogen was applied. The same group also reported the catalytic effect of sulfated zirconia and several zeolites in methane chlorination.13,34 The high selectivity to CH3Cl (99%) can be obtained over mordenite using a molar ratio of
CH4:Cl2 4 at >623 K, while lower temperatures and small
methane excess favour the radical pathways and consequent polyhalogenation. Nevertheless, the zeolite catalysts displayed a fast deactivation that was associated with excessive dealumination. The interest in selective halogenations has been rekindled in the early 2000s as a response to a shale gas surge. In addition to their work on non-catalytic bromination and CH2Br2 reforming via reproportionation and hydrodebromination,29,31 the groups of McFarland and Metiu described sulfated Nb2O5 and ZrO2 as selective bromination catalysts (95% CH3Br),21 while Degirmenci et al.35 reported high CH3Br selectivity (>99%) over sulfated ZrO2 included in SBA-15 structures (S-ZrO2-SBA-15) at large bromine excess. Joo et al.36 showed that methane chlorination over H-Y, Pt/H-Y and Pt/Na-Y leads to a slightly higher activity compared to the non-catalytic reaction, although the selectivity patterns remain almost unaffected. Batamack et al.37 reported the one-pot conversion of methane to valuable hydrocarbons by integrating methane halogenation and CH3X coupling over SAPO-34 catalyst achieved using a high CH4:X2 molar ratio of ca. 10.
In spite of these encouraging results, the previous reports were typically limited to the reaction of one halogen (i.e., Cl2 or Br2) and few catalytic systems, which were investigated under very different regimes, precluding thus to assess the catalytic over non-catalytic effects and to derive the generalized performance trends as a function of catalyst family and type of halogen, which are essential for the catalyst development. Besides, the stability of halomethanes over different materials and propensity of the latter towards coking or reactions with halogen under corrosive halogenation environment were rarely discussed.
Herein, aiming to set the basis that will revitalize the research in this field, we conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of a large library of catalytic materials comprising inorganic and carbon carriers, supported noble metals, metal oxides, chlorides and oxyflourides, as well as sulfated systems and zeolites in both methane chlorination and bromination under identical reaction conditions and provided the general overview on their potential to promote these reactions. In addition, the impact of the framework structure and topology on the performance of zeolite catalysts in methane chlorination was investigated, which along with the kinetics analysis uncovered the significant role of confinement effects on C-H bond activation with chlorine.

The material was dried at ambient pressure and 333 K, and then thermally treated in flowing N2 (GHSV = 10,000 h-1) at 673 K for 5 h (5 K min-1). TaOF3/Al2O3 was prepared by gradually dissolving TaF5 (ABCR, 99%) in cold (195 K) methanol (Acros, 99.8%) followed by the addition of the resulting solution (0.48 M) to -Al2O3 (2.0 cm3 g-1 Al2O3).
Thereafter, the material was calcined at 523 K (1.5 K min-1).
Sulfated oxides S-ZrO2 (Alfa Aesar, 2-4% active SO3) and Nafion (Aldrich, SAC-13, 10-20% Nafion on SiO2) were purchased commercially.S-TiO2 was synthesized by stirring TiO2 (Aldrich, nanopowder,

The zeolites containing ammonium ion were thus transformed in protonic (H) form.
Li-ZSM-5-25, Na-ZSM-5-25, Cs-ZSM-5-25, Ca-ZSM-5-25 and Fe-ZSM-25 were prepared by triple ion exchange of H-ZSM-25 zeolite using a 0.1 M aqueous solution of the respective salts, LiNO3 (FLUKA, 98%), NaNO3 (Acros, 99%), CsNO3 (Acros,

Pt-ZSM-5-25 was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of H-ZSM-5-25 material with a solution of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2·nH2O (1 wt% Pt) using the analogues procedure detailed for supported metal catalysts. Mg-ZSM-5-140 (2 wt% MgO) was prepared following the recipe of Liu et al.18 Herein, 0.16 M solution of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich,99%) was mixed with H-ZSM-5-140 zeolite for 2 h (3.2 cm3 g-1 zeolite). The suspension was dehydrated at 353 K for 4 h, dried and calcined at 723 K for 8 h.
H-ZSM-25-ox was prepared by refluxing the parent H-ZSM-5-25 sample with 1 M H2C2O4 aqueous solution (50 cm3 g-1 zeolyte) for 13 h. Thereafter, the material was recovered by filtration, washed with deionized water, dried and calcined. H-ZSM-5-25-st was derived by steaming (100 mol% H2O) the parent H-ZSM-5-25 material in fluidized bed reactor (GHSV = 5350 h-1) for 12 h. H-ZSM-5-40-at zeolite was prepared using the well-established alkaline treatment protocol.39 In brief, the parent H-ZSM-5-40 zeolite was exposed to a 0.2 M NaOH (Acros, 98.5%) aqueous solution (3.75 cm3 g-1 zeolyte) and the resulting suspension was stirred at 338 K for 30 min in a Mettler Toledo Easymax 102 reactor system. The treatment was quenched by diluting the mixture with a twentyfold excess of deionized water, followed by solid separation by filtration and its washing until neutral pH. The material was ion exchanged three times with 0.1 M NH4NO3 (Acros, 99%) aqueous solution (100 cm3 g-1 zeolyte) at 338 K for 12 h,and finally dried and calcined.
Nanocrystalline H-ZSM-5-40-nc zeolite was synthesized according to the procedure of Van Grieken et al.40 Aluminium isopropoxide (Al-iPr, Aldrich, 98%), NaOH, TEOS and ethanol (Acros, 99.8%) were added in the as listed order to a 1 M TPAOH aqueous solution (molar ratio of
TEOS:Al-iPr:NaOH:ethanol:TPAOH = 40:1:0.16:100:25)
and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The clear solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated under static conditions at 438 K for 4 days. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water, dried and calcined.
H-SnBETA-220 was synthesized using the alkaline-assisted stannation,41 that is equivalent to the above detailed alkaline-treatment in all the aspects, except that the parent BETA-220 zeolite (Tosoh Corp.) was exposed to an aqueous solution comprising 0.3 M NaOH, 0.04 M SnSO4 (ABCR, 95%) and 0.2 M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, Alfa Aesar, 20 wt%).
Unless stated otherwise, the standard drying conditions involve a pressure of 5 kPa (vaccum), a temperature of 373 K and a treatment time of 12 h, while the standard calcination conditions involve the static air atmosphere, a temperature of 823 K, a time of treatment of 5 h and a heating rate of 5 K min-1.

The presence of the sulfate groups in sulfated oxides was evidenced by Diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS) performed using Bruker Optics Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with a high-temperature DRIFT cell (Harrick) and an MCT detector. N2 isotherms of selected catalysts were recorded at 77 K using Micromeritics TriStar II analyzer. Samples (ca. 0.15 g) were evacuated to 50 kPa at 573 K for 12 h prior to the measurement.
Catalyst testing Chlorination and bromination of methane as well as the reactions of CH2Cl2 and CH2Br2 with different solids were performed at ambient pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor setup described in Fig 2. Gases, CH4 (PanGas, purity
5.0), Cl2 (PanGas, purity 2.8), O2 (PanGas, purity 5.0),
Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0) and He (PanGas, purity 5.0) were fed by a set of digital mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst). Br2 was supplied by passing CH4 flow through a bubbler containing liquid Br2 (ABCR, 99%) and placed in a water bath, the temperature of which was maintained at 3020.5 K. Water, CH2Cl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and CH2Br2 (ABCR, 99%) were supplied by a syringe pump (Nexus 6000, Chemyx). The catalyst (catalyst volume, Vcat = 2.7 or 15 cm3, particle size,dp = 0.4-0.6 mm) was loaded in the central wide section of the glass reactor (characteristic dimensions,dr = 10.5 mm,dt = 4 mm,hr = 55 mm and hc = 5.5 or dr = 18.5 mm,dt = 4.8 mm,hr = 80 mm and hc = 10.2 mm, Fig 2 inset) between the two plugs of quartz wool. The reactor was heated by home-build electric oven. The temperature was controlled by a thermocouple inserted in a glass thermowell (outside diameter, dtw = 3 mm), which was positioned along the vertical reactor axis with its tip aligned with the bottom of the bed,while the pressure was monitored by the pressure sensor installed prior to the reactor. The thermowell and the bed composed of glass beads were used to additionally reduce the volume of the narrow top and bottom reactor sections,respectively. The aluminium foil shielding the reactor, as well as the opaque tubbing, connections and valves were used to preclude the contact of light with the reaction mixtures and hence photo-induced halogenation. The gas lines used to feed Br2, water, CH2Cl2 and CH2Br2, as well as the downstream lining were maintained at 393 K to prevent the condensation of these reactants and reaction products such as CH2Cl2, CH2Br2 and CHCl3.
Prior to testing, the solids were heated to 723 K for 2 h in flowing He (GHSV = 13700 h-1) to eliminate the traces of moisture, O2 and other possible gas impurities. The only exceptions were PdCl2/SiO2, CuCl2/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3 and Nafion catalysts, which were treated at 573 K to avoid their potential thermal decomposition or volatilization. Thereafter,the bed was cooled down to desired temperature and left to stabilize for at least 30 min before the catalytic test. Unless stated otherwise, the reactant mixture comprising CH4:Cl2 in a molar ratio of 8.5:3.5 was fed at GHSV = 267 h-1 or 50 h-1 in methane chlorination and the mixture containing CH4:Br2 in a molar ratio of 8.5:3.20.1 was introduced at GHSV = 260 h-1 or

Moderate methane excess simulates the practically relevant operating regime, which strives at full halogen consumption that facilitates the downstream product separation while minimizing the size of the hydrocarbon recycle. Moreover, the selected ratios were smaller than those at which free-radical halogenations display an inherently high selectivity to CH3X,enabling thus the resolution of the catalytic from the non-catalytic effects.15,34 With regard to the latter problematics, the catalyst activities were compared at constant GHSV and constant temperature (GHSV = 267 h-1 and T = 523 K in methane chlorination, GHSV = 260 h-1 and T = 643 K in methane bromination) and benchmarked to the activity patterns of the empty glass reactor and reactor accommodating the bed of quartz particles, whereby the values of the latter two reaction parameters are consistent with the typical conditions applied in the previous studies.13,15,34,35,37 This approach, which was practiced in the work of Olah at al.,13,15,34 enables the decoupling of the catalytic from the non-catalytic gas-phase contributions, since the volume of the interparticle voids does not differ significantly between the different catalyst beds. Besides, it also has a practical relevance as it shows the level of productivity enhancement of a given reactor in the presence of

The assessment of both methane and halogen conversion in methane chlorination at 523 K indicated that the bed of quartz particles displays an almost identical performance as an empty reactor of the same volume (Fig 3a). Considering the fact that the effective void volume of the bed is ca. 2 times smaller than that of the empty reactor (bed porosity,   0.4),43 this result suggests that chlorination reaction is promoted even in the presence of inert and low-surface area solids. The conversion of methane and Cl2 over Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, S-ZrO2 and H-SAPO-34 catalysts was ca. 2-2.5 higher compared to quartz, suggesting the further activity promotion over these solids. The onset of methane bromination was shifted to ca. 120 K higher temperature with respect to chlorination. The activity of quartz particles was comparable to that of an empty reactor, but in contrast to chlorination, methane conversion in bromination was almost unaffected by the catalytic materials.
Still, the conversion of bromine was higher over the catalysts,especially H-SAPO-34, which can be associated with a more pronounced polybromination, oxidation and reactions with a catalyst (vide infra).
In addition to the conversion profiles, the differences in the selectivity to CH3X were evaluated as another indicator of the potential catalytic effects (Fig 3b). In general, the operation under comparable CH4:X2 molar ratios and GHSVs led to a higher fraction of CH3X in bromination compared to chlorination (SCH3Br = 80-95% verusus SCH3Cl = 52-90% at XCH4 = 5-18%). Besides, the selectivity to CH3X declined less steeply upon increasing the methane conversion in the former reaction, corroborating the higher inherent propensity to selective monohalogenation in the former reaction.
Nevertheless, the selectivity to CH3X in both reactions decreased in the similar order,empty reactor  quartz  Pt/SiO2 > TaOF3/Al2O3  S-ZrO2 > H-SAPO-34, indicating the prominent impact of the catalyst on the product distribution.
In order to generalize the performance trends, the analysis was extended to a significantly broader range of the materials which can be classified into four distinct groups, supports,metal-based materials, sulphated oxides and zeolites. Aiming to provide the comprehensive overview of their catalytic behaviours and the facile benchmarking of the activity and selectivity patterns of the materials with respect to the void reactors, supports as well as other families and their individual members, the circular plots are devised as presented in Figs 4 and 5. These are composed of the top semicircle, which provides the information of the catalyst activity and the bottom semicircle, which outlines the product distribution patterns. The semicircles are further divided into four circular sectors, a-d (top) and e-f (bottom), which present the performances of the materials within a specific family. The activity sectors provide the information on the halogen and methane conversion at constant temperature and GHSV,which both increase in the direction from the circle centre. The bottom sectors present the selectivities to CH3X, CH2X2, CHX3 and COx as a function of methane conversion, which increases in clockwise direction, and indicate the formation of coke deposits. The red- and dark-coloured background areas of the subsections denote the performance regions of empty reactors and inorganic carriers, respectively, serving thus as the
