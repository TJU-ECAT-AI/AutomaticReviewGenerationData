The catalysts were prepared by two variations of the wet-impregnation method using aqueous ammonium metavanadate or organically-based methanolic vanadyl acetylacetonate solutions. The catalyst surface area depends on the vanadium content and the preparation method. Catalyst characterization (i.e. XRD, 51V NMR, FTIR, LRS) results indicate the presence of poor crystalline Mg-orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8), while the presence of other Mg-vanadates is not clear. Oxygen isotopic-exchange experiments on VMgO catalysts indicate an R2 process: 18O2  216O2 s ! 18O18O16O16O4 s ! 218O2 s 16 O2g at temperatures higher than 1023 K, while an R0-type [18O2(g)16O2(g)!216O18O(g)] is observed at 823 K, as a consequence of a small activity for homophase isotopic. Both the catalytic activity and the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depend on the vanadium content but is independent on the catalyst preparation method. This behavior is observed in the ODH of n- butane with both O2 and N2O. However, while conversion of n-butane was higher when using O2 as oxidant, the selectivity to C4-olens was higher with N2O as oxidant. Pulse experiments show that prereduced surfaces are not effective in producing olens while selective catalysts are achieved with preoxidized surface. A mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n- butane is proposed. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction VanadiumMagnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts have been proposed as selective catalysts in the oxi- dative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane [14] and propane [510]. VMgO mixed oxide catalysts have generally been obtained by impregnation of MgO with an ammonium metavanadate solution [1,2,5,11].
However, other preparation methods have been employed, including impregnation of Mg(OH)2 with an ammonium metavanadate solution [6], adsorption of vanadyl compounds from non-aqueous solutions [12,13]; co-precipitation of Mg-nitrate and NH4VO3 [14] or of Mg-oxalate and vanadyl oxalate [7,15];citrate methods [9].
Characterizations of resulting materials have been carried out by several techniques,i.e.
XRD
[2,3,6,7,9,16], infrared [2,3,6,7,9,11,16], laser Raman [7,911,16], diffuse reectance UV-vis [11,15], 51V

P I I S 0 9 2 0 - 5 8 6 1 ( 9 8 ) 0 0 0 1 0 - 8 [27]. The nature of Mgvanadates revealed by those techniques is found to depend on the V-concentration and the preparative procedure adopted. Dependence on preparative procedure and vanadium content has likewise been reported for the catalytic properties of VMgO catalysts in the ODH of propane, and for the dispersion of vanadium on MgO [7].
Not surprisingly, then, the nature of active and selective sites for the ODH of alkanes is still under discussion. Thus, isolated VO4 tetrahedra in both amorphous and crystalline Mg3V2O8 [13,7], dimeric VOV-like species on Mg2V2O7 [6], or synergetic effects between crystalline phases [9], each have been held mainly responsible for high selectivity in ODH of propane and n-butane. Other factors, includ- ing the presence of impurities [30,31], the acidbase character of the catalysts [4], or the use of supported vanadium magnesium mixed oxides [32] are also reported to inuence the catalytic behavior of these materials.
The aim of the work, reported in the present paper,include further characterization of VMgO catalysts,clarication of the inuence of preparative methods on their catalytic properties, and a study of the extent to which activity and selectivity in ODH of n-butane could be enhanced by utilizing N2O rather than using molecular oxygen as oxidant. The extent of agreement of the results obtained in both continuous- ow and pulsed-reactant experiments, with possible mechanisms for the ODH of n-butane [2,4,6], is discussed.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalyst preparation MgO was prepared by the calcination of magne- sium oxalate at 923 K for 3 h. Magnesium oxalate was obtained by precipitation, at pH 56, of a magnesium acetate solution with an oxalic acid solution and it was ltered, washed and dried at 353 K for 16 h [7]. Two series of catalysts featuring vanadium supported on such MgO were prepared by two variations of the wet- impregnation method: impregnation with an aqueous ammonium metavanadate solution, according to the previously reported procedure [1] (AC-series), or with an organically-based methanolic vanadyl acetylaceto- nate solution, using different methanol/vanadyl acet- ylacetonate molar ratio (OR-series) [31]. The solids were dried at 343 K and 27 KPa and then kept at 383 K overnight. Finally, the samples were calcined in air at 873 K for 4 h. Identication of the resulting MgO- supported vanadium catalysts (referred as AC- or OR- series) is afforded by a number that indicates the wt% of vanadium expressed as V2O5 (Tables 1 and 2,respectively).
