Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

1.The literature does not provide information to directly answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, or the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The literature focuses on the selective oxidation of propane over V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 catalysts using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It discusses the activation of C-H bonds in propane and the formation of propene and oxygenated products but does not compare redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts or discuss the role of CO2 in the reaction mechanism.

1.文献没有提供直接回答关于比较和对比在氧化脱氢烷烃中红氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制，传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，或不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性的问题的信息。文献集中于使用周期性密度泛函理论（DFT）计算研究丙烷在V2O5和V2O5/TiO2催化剂上的选择性氧化。它讨论了丙烷中C-H键的活化和丙烯和含氧化合物的形成，但没有比较红氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性催化剂，也没有讨论CO2在反应机制中的作用。
