Answer: The literature does not provide detailed mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. It does not compare the effectiveness of different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes over oxidized diamond-supported catalysts in the presence of carbon dioxide. It reports that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited comparatively higher catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes in the presence of CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. UV-Vis analyses revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species.

回答: 文献没有提供C-H键活化和催化剂再生在氧化脱氢烷烃中对于氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂的详细机制。它没有比较V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性。文献主要关注在二氧化碳存在下,氧化金刚石支撑的催化剂对轻烷烃的脱氢。它报告说,在二氧化碳存在下,氧化金刚石支撑的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在较低烷烃的脱氢中表现出相对较高的催化活性。观察到二氧化碳对氧化金刚石支撑的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂上丁烷转化率和丁烯产率的促进作用。UV-Vis分析显示,CO2使表面V2O5和Cr2O3的氧化状态略高于没有CO2的情况。在较低烷烃的脱氢中,CO2在氧化金刚石支撑的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂上的作用可能是维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态。
