1. Mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, and oxidant utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with a focus on metal oxide catalysts and CO2 as an alternative oxidant

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a critical process in the petrochemical industry, is significantly influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the oxidant \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, where oxygen is donated to the alkane to form alkenes and water, with CO2 regenerating the catalyst by refilling lattice oxygen vacancies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 heterolytically into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates alkanes, but bind alkanes at acidic sites, risking cracking and deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, unlike CO2, which is milder and avoids over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Catalysts' effectiveness for CO2 activation varies: V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 are highly active due to redox properties and oxygen mobility, while transition metal clusters like Mo2C are also effective \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2 dissociation mechanisms involve activation by the catalyst, with energy barriers influenced by redox properties, and catalyst stability and selectivity are crucial for overall reaction effectiveness \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\].

In oxidative dehydrogenation, redox-active metal oxides activate C-H bonds via the MvK mechanism, forming water and an oxygen vacancy that requires an oxidant for catalyst regeneration \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\]. Redox-inactive oxides directly reduce the oxidant without forming a vacancy \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\]. CO2 can act as an oxidant through direct dissociation or hydrogenation before CO formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\]. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation, VOx/SiO2 has a lower but still significant barrier, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters show easier CO2 dissociation, highlighting their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\].

Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 activate C-H bonds through a redox mechanism, with CO2 partially oxidizing the catalyst to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, have less effective CO2 activation due to higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

CO2 maintains higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, acting as an oxidant for catalyst regeneration over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Notably, V2O5 exhibits high catalytic activities for dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, transition metal oxides follow a redox mechanism where propane oxidation by surface lattice oxygen is rate-limiting \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. h-BN, in contrast, involves heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds followed by gas phase oxidant reduction, showing high ethylene selectivity \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. The literature lacks direct comparison between redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts but highlights the differing mechanisms \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters activate CO2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, though the literature does not discuss their effectiveness in detail \[10.1002/anie.202002440\].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient catalysts for CO2 activation, particularly in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The role of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which avoids over-oxidation, presents a promising avenue for the design of catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability. The effectiveness of catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane suggests that further investigation into their mechanisms and optimization could lead to significant improvements in the process. Additionally, the exploration of alternative redox-inactive catalysts that can overcome the limitations of cracking and deactivation while maintaining high activity for CO2 activation is a promising direction. The integration of computational methods, such as DFT calculations, with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration, guiding the rational design of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation.
