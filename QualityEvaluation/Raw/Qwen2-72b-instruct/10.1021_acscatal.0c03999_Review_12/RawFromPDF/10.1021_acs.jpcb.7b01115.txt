Abstract
Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory (DFT-GGA, PW91) calculations are used to study the reaction mechanism for nitric oxide (NO) reduction by hydrogen (H2) on Pt(100). Energetics of various N–O activation paths, including both direct and hydrogen-assisted N–O bond-breaking paths, and the formation of three different N-containing products (N2, N2O, and NH3), are systematically studied. On the basis of our analysis, NO* dissociation has a lower barrier than NO* hydrogenation to HNO* or NOH*, and therefore, the direct NO dissociation path is predicted to dominate N–O activation on clean Pt(100). The reaction of atomic N* with N* and NO* is proposed as the mechanism for N2 and N2O formation, respectively. NH3 formation from N* via three successive hydrogenation steps is also studied and is found to be kinetically more difficult than N2 and N2O formation from N*. Finally, NO adsorption phase diagrams on Pt(100) are constructed, and these phase diagrams suggest that, at low temperatures (e.g., 400 K), the Pt(100) surface may be covered by half a monolayer of NO. We propose that high NO coverage might affect the NO + H2 reaction mechanism, and therefore, one should explicitly take the NO coverage into consideration in first-principles studies to determine the reaction mechanism on catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions. A detailed analysis of high NO coverage effects on the reaction mechanism will be presented in a separate contribution.

1. Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is a major pollutant produced in the combustion of fossil fuels and has many deleterious effects. (1−3) To limit its release to the atmosphere, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have been enacted, stimulating the development of more efficient methods to abate NO emitted from combustion processes. (1,4−8) NO dissociation into N2 and O2 is exothermic, which suggests that it is thermodynamically favorable. However, because of kinetic limitations, the N–O bond is difficult to break. In general, a catalyst and a reducing agent are needed. In automobiles that consume gasoline, three-way catalysis (TWC) is a generally used method, with carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons acting as the reductants. In stationary plants, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO is a common process where ammonia (NH3) is used as the typical reductant. (1−4,9−13) A number of experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to investigate NO + CO (14−25) and NO + NH3 (26−33) reactions. Although these methods are widely applied, the use of a very expensive metal, Rh, in TWC, and the environmental and economic drawbacks associated with NH3 in SCR, motivate the search for improved NO removal processes. The reduction of NO by H2 over transition-metal catalysts is one promising alternative method. (6,8,9,34) In addition, the presence of H2O vapor in the NO + CO reaction mixture, potentially leading to the in situ formation of H2 (through the water-gas-shift reaction), which in turn can serve as a second reductant for NO in this reactive mixture, could be informed from the results of this present study. (34−36)
In NO reduction by H2, there are three major reactions
corresponding to three different products, namely, N2, N2O, and NH3. N2 is the most desirable product because it is environmentally benign, while N2O and NH3 have negative impacts on the environment. Many researchers have examined NO reduction by H2 on various monometallic catalysts, e.g., Pt, (21,37−50) Pd, (21,40,41,44,51,52) Rh, (21,40,41,43,44,53−57) Ir, (44,58,59) Au, (60−62) Ni, (63,64) and metal alloys. (43,56,65,66) Experimental studies suggest that chemisorbed H atoms (H*) assist the dissociation of NO and enhance the reaction rate, (21,25,48,49,67) which is similar to the role that H* plays in the intensely studied Fischer–Tropsch reaction. (68−72) Theoretical analyses of NO reduction on H-preadsorbed Au surfaces suggest that the kinetically most favorable N–O activation path is the hydrogen-assisted route, where NO* is hydrogenated to NOH* before N–O bond scission. (61,62) H-assisted NO dissociation is also reported as an important step on the basis of experimental studies of NO reduction by H2 on Pt catalysts. (5,21,48,49) However, the detailed reaction mechanism for NO reduction by H2 remains unsettled.
A recent theoretical study from our group investigated the NO reduction by H2 reaction mechanism on Pt(111). (73) We found that the H-assisted NO dissociation path is indeed more favorable on Pt(111), and that the addition of at least two hydrogen atoms is required to lower the barrier for N–O bond breaking on that surface. To gain more insights into the active sites for this reaction on Pt nanoparticle catalysts, in the present work, we study the mechanism of NO reduction by H2 on a more open platinum surface, Pt(100), using periodic, self-consistent density functional theory (DFT-GGA, PW91) calculations. To understand the role of hydrogen in N–O activation, we consider the direct NO dissociation as well as H-assisted paths, and rigorously calculate the energetics of all the intermediates and elementary steps in the proposed reaction network. The minimum energy path for N–O activation is identified by comparing the potential energy surfaces of direct and H-assisted NO dissociation paths. Further, the energetics of reactive paths leading to the formation of N2, N2O, and NH3 is studied to gain initial insights into the overall product selectivity.
2. Computational Methods
Periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (74,75) The projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials (76,77) were used to describe electron–ion interactions, and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91) (78) was used to describe the exchange-correlation functional. The electron wave function was expanded using plane waves with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Pt(100) surface was modeled by a periodically repeated four-layer slab, with a (2 × 2) surface unit cell. The top two layers were allowed to relax. Adsorbates were allowed to adsorb on one surface of the slab atop the relaxed layers, and the dipole correction to the electrostatic potential was included accordingly. Successive slabs were separated by a vacuum of ∼12 Å in the z-direction. The first Brillouin zone was sampled with a 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh. (79) Convergence of the total energy with respect to calculation parameters, such as cutoff energy, number of layers in the slab, and k-point set, was confirmed. Structures were fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces acting on the atoms were smaller than 0.05 eV/Å. Spin-polarized calculations were performed to check the magnetic properties of adsorbates; all the calculated ground states have zero magnetic moment. The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method (80,81) was used to determine the minimum energy path and the activation energy barrier for each elementary step. The transition states found by CI-NEB calculations were verified by identifying a single imaginary vibrational frequency along the reaction coordinate. (82) The calculated activation energy barriers (Ea’s) and reaction energies (ΔE’s) are reported with respect to reactant and product states at infinite separation, unless stated otherwise. Zero-point energy (ZPE) and van der Waals corrections were not included in this work, as such corrections are typically small and are not expected to affect the relative energetics of competing reaction pathways. Importantly, these corrections have not been included in many similar DFT-based reaction mechanistic investigations, though they might be of more relevance when a microkinetic modeling analysis is involved. (73,83−88) The calculated lattice constant of Pt is 3.99 Å, in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.92 Å. (89)
The binding energy (BE) of an adsorbate on Pt(100) was calculated as BE = Eads+Pt(100) – EcleanPt(100) – Egas, where Eads+Pt(100), EcleanPt(100), and Egas are the calculated total energies of the Pt(100) slab with the adsorbate on it, the clean Pt(100) slab without adsorbed species, and the adsorbate species in the gas phase, respectively. The differential binding energy of NO was defined as the binding energy of the last NO molecule introduced on the slab, and was calculated as BE(NO) = E(n+1)NO*+Pt(100) – EnNO*+Pt(100) – ENO(gas), where E(n+1)NO*+Pt(100), EnNO*+Pt(100), and ENO(gas) are the calculated total energies of the Pt(100) slab with (n + 1) NO* molecules on it, the Pt(100) slab with n NO* molecules on it (n = 0, 1, 2, 3), and the NO molecule in the gas phase, respectively.
It has been reported that, in the presence of strongly adsorbing species (e.g., NO, CO, etc.), open Pt facets [e.g., Pt(100)] might undergo reconstructions to form more closely packed hexagonal surfaces. (90,91) We did not specifically consider surface reconstruction effects in this study. Though the top two layers of Pt atoms were allowed to relax in all calculations, the unit cell size might limit our capability of capturing stabilizing surface reconstructions.
NO adsorption phase diagrams (92−94) on Pt(100) were constructed from the grand potential (Ω) at each NO surface coverage, with the equation Ω = EnNO*+Pt(100) – EcleanPt(100) – nμNO – TS, where n is the total number of NO molecules in the system, μNO is the chemical potential of NO, T is the absolute temperature, and S is the vibrational entropy of the n NO adsorbates calculated with all NO molecules relaxed. The chemical potential of NO is calculated as μNO = ENO(gas) + kBT ln(pNO/p0) – TSNO(gas), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, pNO is the partial pressure of NO, p0 is the reference pressure of 1 atm, and SNO(gas) is the entropy of NO in the gas phase.
3. Results and Discussion
This section is organized as follows: We will first introduce the whole reaction network, including both N–O activation and product formation mechanisms, on the Pt(100) surface. Then, detailed adsorption properties of surface species and energetics of elementary steps will be presented. Finally, we will discuss our results for NO adsorption at different coverages, concluding with the NO adsorption phase diagrams on Pt(100).
3.1. NO + H2 Reaction Mechanism on Pt(100)
The NO reduction by H2 reaction network on Pt(100) considered in this study is presented in Table 1 and includes 6 gas-phase species, 14 surface species, and 22 elementary steps. The reaction network is separated into two parts: (i) the N–O activation mechanism and (ii) the product formation mechanism. The N–O activation mechanism contains a H2 dissociation step (R1), a NO adsorption step (R2), all NO hydrogenation steps (R4, R5, R8, and R9), and several N–O bond-breaking steps (R3, R6, R7, R10, and R11), while the product formation mechanism involves N2 (R12 and R13), N2O (R14 and R15), NH3 (R16–R19), and H2O (R20–R22) formation and desorption steps.

In the N–O activation mechanism, the N–O bond is proposed to potentially break in four different surface species, NO*, HNO*, NOH*, and HNOH*. We will refer to the path that involves N–O bond breaking in NO* as the direct NO dissociation path. Adding one H* to NO* to form HNO* or NOH* intermediates before N–O bond breaking is possible in the presence of H*. HNO* and NOH* are isomers of each other. N–O bond breaking in HNO* or in NOH* is referred to as the HNO-mediated path or the NOH-mediated path, respectively. The formation of HNO* or NOH* in the presence of hydrogen has been reported in the context of NO reduction reactions, and has been proposed as a possible key reaction step. (54,61,62,95−97) Alternatively, adding two hydrogen atoms to NO* to form HNOH* prior to N–O bond breaking is also possible and will be referred to as the HNOH-mediated path.
In the product formation mechanism, we propose paths for the production of all three possible N-containing products (N2, N2O, and NH3), as well as a route toward H2O formation.

Our calculations show that the most stable site for H* is the bridge site (Figure 1a) with a BE of −2.89 eV. Previous periodic DFT studies showed the same site preference for H* and gave similar BE values at the same coverage (0.25 monolayer, ML). (87,98,99) We find that N* binds to Pt(100) with a BE of −4.48 eV on the hollow site (Figure 1b), in excellent agreement with previously reported results. (87,99−101) Atomic O* binds to the bridge site (Figure 1c) with a BE of −4.25 eV, which also agrees well with previous calculation results. (17,100−104) Among these three atomic species, N* binds the strongest. Importantly, N-containing species tend to preferentially bind to Pt(100) through the N atom (Figure 1).
On Pt(100), NO* prefers to bind on the bridge site through the N atom with its molecular axis normal to the surface (Figure 1d), which is consistent with results in the literature. (17,103,105−107) The calculated BE of NO* in our study is −2.24 eV, very close to the NO adsorption energy calculated by Ge et al. using GGA at the same coverage. (103) Similar results were also obtained in other theoretical studies. (17,100,102) NO adsorption on Pt(100) was also studied extensively using experimental techniques. (15,108−111) The calorimetric heat of adsorption of NO was in the range from −205 to −180 kJ/mol (−2.13 to −1.87 eV) at coverage of ∼0.05–0.30 ML, which is consistent with our calculated value. (15)
Both HNO* and NOH* have been proposed as possible reaction intermediates after the addition of one hydrogen atom to NO in NO reduction reactions. (54,61,62,97) HNO* adsorbs through both the N and O atoms on two parallel bridge sites across one hollow site (Figure 1e). Our calculated BE of HNO* on Pt(100) is −2.30 eV, in reasonable agreement with the value of −2.04 eV calculated by Perez-Ramirez et al. (102) In addition, our optimized Pt–N and Pt–O bond lengths are consistent with their results. NOH* is isomeric to HNO*. The BE of NOH* on Pt(100) is −2.80 eV. NOH* binds on the bridge site through the N atom, with the O atom pointing away from the surface (Figure 1f). The angle between the N–O bond and the surface normal is 49.7°. Perez-Ramirez et al. found a similar binding geometry of NOH* on Pt(100); however, their calculated BE is −1.76 eV. (102) Ford et al. studied the adsorption of HNO* and NOH* on Pt(111) and reported binding energies of −3.91 and −4.14 eV with respect to gas-phase NO + H, respectively, indicating that NOH* is 0.23 eV more stable on Pt(111). (112) Using the gas-phase energy of NO + H as the reference, we calculated the binding energies of HNO* and NOH* on Pt(100) to be −4.62 and −4.10 eV, respectively. Therefore, on Pt(100), HNO* is 0.52 eV more stable than NOH*. Similar to NOH*, HNOH* also binds on the bridge site through the N atom with a BE of −2.36 eV. The N–O axis is tilted 47.2° from the surface normal (Figure 1g), which resembles the binding structure of NOH*.
N2* adsorbs to the top site of Pt(100) with a perpendicular configuration (Figure 1h). The calculated BE of N2* on Pt(100) is −0.40 eV. Both the most stable structure and the BE agree well with reported results of calculations. (17,101,102) Similarly to N2, we find that N2O, a possible product in the NO reduction by H2, prefers to bind on the top site through the terminal N atom (Figure 1i). The calculated BE of N2O* is −0.18 eV, in excellent agreement with −0.17 eV reported by Perez-Ramirez et al. (102) Mei et al. also found that the top site was the most stable site for N2O*. (101)
The adsorption of NHx* (x = 1, 2, 3) is also investigated in this work. NH* prefers to bind at the hollow site (Figure 1j) with a BE of −4.01 eV. The N–H bond is perpendicular to the surface with H pointing upward. The most favorable binding site for NH2* is the bridge site (Figure 1k) with a BE of −3.14 eV. NH3* prefers to bind the top site via the N atom, with all three N–H bonds pointing away from the surface with equivalent H–N–H bond angles (Figure 1l), and with a BE of −0.82 eV. All NHx* intermediates bind on the surface through the N atom, and the fewer H atoms they have, the more strongly they interact with the surface. Our findings agree well with previously reported NHx* binding properties on Pt(100). (87,99,102,113)
OH* preferentially adsorbs on the bridge site of Pt(100) through the O atom (Figure 1m) with a BE of −2.93 eV. The O–H axis is tilted by 71.2° from the surface normal. The BE of H2O* on Pt(100) is −0.29 eV. It binds on the top site through the O atom (Figure 1n). The calculated BEs of OH* and H2O* are in good agreement with available results. (102,104)
3.3. Energetics of Elementary Steps on Clean Pt(100)
Mechanism of N–O Activation
As discussed above, the N–O bond can be activated through different paths: the direct NO dissociation path, the HNO-mediated path, the NOH-mediated path, and the HNOH-mediated path. The calculated activation energy barriers (Ea’s), reaction energies (ΔE’s), and transition-state bond lengths for elementary steps in those paths are summarized in Table 3. All the transition-state configurations are shown in Figure 2.

H2 Dissociation (H2 + 2* → H* + H*)
H2 dissociation is spontaneous with a reaction energy of −1.20 eV on Pt(100). The lack of a barrier and exothermic character of this reaction on clean Pt(100) ensure the availability of atomic H* on the surface, which is the prerequisite for the subsequent hydrogenation steps.
Direct NO Dissociation
In this path, the N–O bond is broken directly from NO* (i.e., NO* + * → N* + O*). The calculated activation energy barrier and reaction energy are 0.96 and 0.79 eV, respectively. Ge and Neurock found the same barrier for this step in their study of NO dissociation on Pt(100). (103) Similar values were also reported in other theoretical (17,100−102) and experimental studies. (14) To break the N–O bond, the O atom first moves down toward the Pt(100) surface to reach a molecular NO configuration that is quasiparallel to the surface, which is about 0.45 eV less stable than the most favorable perpendicular NO configuration. Then, the N–O bond is stretched over a hollow site to reach the transition state with a N–O bond length of 1.97 Å. Similar results for this elementary step have been reported on Pt(100) by Ge et al. (103) and Eichler et al. (17) On clean Pt(111), a much higher barrier of 2.32 eV was found for NO dissociation, indicating that the more open Pt(100) facet is more active for dissociating NO. (73)
HNO-Mediated and NOH-Mediated Paths
NO* + H* → HNO* + * is endothermic by 0.50 eV and has an activation energy barrier of 1.21 eV. For the formation of the N–H bond, the initial state of NO* and H* contains both species at opposing bridge sites. NO* then tilts toward the H atom to facilitate bond formation. At the transition state, the N–H bond length is 1.32 Å. Adding H* to the O-end of NO* to form NOH* (R5) is also an endothermic step (ΔE = 1.04 eV) with an activation energy barrier of 1.07 eV, which is 0.14 eV lower than the barrier for HNO* formation. For the formation of the O–H bond, the N–O axis tilts away from the surface normal such that the O atom moves down to reach the H* atom. The O–H bond length at the transition state is 1.22 Å. We note that the barriers for these hydrogenation steps are higher than that for direct NO* dissociation, indicating that the hydrogenation of NO* to form HNO* or NOH* is less energetically favorable.
N–O bond-breaking steps in HNO* (R6) and NOH* (R7) have barriers of 0.18 and 0.34 eV, respectively, which are significantly lower than the barrier for direct NO dissociation (0.96 eV). Therefore, the addition of H to NO* weakens the N–O bond and thus decreases the bond-breaking barrier, which is reminiscent of results reported earlier for H-assisted C–O bond breaking on transition-metal surfaces. (114−116)
HNOH-Mediated Path
Besides the case of adding one hydrogen atom to NO* prior to breaking the N–O bond, we also examine N–O bond breaking after the addition of two hydrogen atoms. Our results show that further hydrogenation of HNO* (R8) and NOH* (R9) to HNOH* has barriers of 0.68 and 0.64 eV, respectively. We note that those barriers are more than 0.40 eV lower than the barriers for the first NO* hydrogenation, indicating that addition of the second hydrogen becomes energetically easier after the initial NO* hydrogenation step. We consider two possible paths to break the N–O bond in HNOH*. One is to break only the N–O bond (R10), and the other is to break the N–O and N–H bonds, and to form an additional O–H bond simultaneously (R11, HNOH* + * → N* + H2O*). The calculated activation energy barrier for the former step is 0.64 eV, while for the latter the barrier is 1.46 eV. Therefore, the N–O bond-breaking path leading to NH* + OH*, is preferred for N–O bond breaking in HNOH*. Comparing this barrier with that for direct NO dissociation (R3), we find that N–O bond breaking becomes easier in the twice-hydrogenated NO.
The thermochemistry and activation energy barriers of various elementary steps discussed in the previous section are summarized in the potential energy surface shown in Figure 3. The DFT results suggest that the minimum energy path for N–O activation on clean Pt(100) may go through the direct NO dissociation path, rather than the H-assisted paths. This is mainly because of the lower barrier for direct NO dissociation compared to the barrier for NO hydrogenations, and is despite the weakening of the N–O bond following hydrogenations to HNO*, NOH*, and HNOH* (i.e., the hydrogenation steps may kinetically limit these paths). Yet, this conclusion is only tentative, as it reflects expectations on low-coverage surfaces, and even then, it is not informed by insights to be derived by detailed microkinetic models. On Pt(111), we have found that the H-assisted pathways are more favorable because direct NO dissociation on that facet is difficult, suggesting that NO reduction by H2 is sensitive to the surface structure of Pt. (73)

The reference zero of the energy scale corresponds to the energy of NO and H2 in the gas phase, and the clean Pt(100) slab, at infinite separation from each other. All species at each state are infinitely separated. Table 3 provides further details on the energetics for these elementary steps. The energetically most favorable path is the direct NO dissociation path (in bold, red).
Product Formation Mechanism
The direct NO dissociation path is preferred based on the N–O activation mechanism discussed above, leading to adsorbed N* and O* surface species. We next investigate the formation of three major N-containing products, namely, N2, N2O, and NH3, from N*, and study H2O formation from O* as well. The calculated activation energy barriers (Ea’s), reaction energies (ΔE’s), and transition-state bond lengths for elementary steps in the product formation mechanism are summarized in Table 4. All the respective transition-state configurations are shown in Figure 4.

N2 Formation
N2 is the most desirable product among all three major products in NO reduction by H2. Formation of N2 from the combination of two atomic N* species (R12, N* + N* → N2* + *) is the most straightforward and widely assumed path. (5,43,61,65) For the formation of N2* on Pt(100), two N* atoms on opposite bridge sites (across a hollow site) move toward each other. At the transition state, the N–N bond length is 2.24 Å. The barrier for this step is 0.45 eV, and it is exothermic by 1.78 eV. In fact, the barrier can be decomposed into the reaction energy to move N* to opposing bridge sites from infinite separation (0.38 eV) and the barrier to form the N–N bond (0.07 eV). A very similar minimum energy path was reported in previous studies with a barrier of 0.06 eV, which is very close to the barrier identified by our CI-NEB calculation. (102)
N2O Formation
Atomic N* derived from NO* dissociation can combine with another adsorbed NO* to form N2O* (R14). The barrier for this step is 0.75 eV, which is about 0.30 eV higher than the barrier for N2 formation. The minimum energy path for N2O* generation is very similar to that of N2* formation. The coadsorption of N* and NO* on two opposite bridge sites (across a hollow site) is the initial state. Atomic N* and the N atom in NO* move toward each other to form the N–N bond over the hollow site in between to reach the transition state. This minimum energy path was also found by other researchers. (102) At the transition state, the N–N bond length is 1.86 Å. The energy of the transition state is 0.47 eV higher than that of the initial state in the minimum energy path, in agreement with a previous DFT-calculated barrier of 0.51 eV on a periodic Pt(100) slab, (100) while Mei et al. found a much higher barrier (1.47 eV) for the same step over Pt(100) surfaces when using platinum nanoparticles in their calculations. (101)
NH3 Formation
Formation of NH3* from adsorbed N* involves three successive hydrogenation steps (R16–R18). The first hydrogenation of N* has a reaction energy of −0.40 eV and is activated by 0.70 eV, in good agreement with a previously reported barrier of 0.58 eV. (87,99) At the initial state, both N* and H* are on bridge sites (across a hollow site) on Pt(100). The final state involves NH* at the same bridge site as N* in the initial state, with the N–H bond tilted by 48° from the surface normal. At the transition state, the N–H bond length is 1.53 Å. The addition of a second hydrogen is exothermic by 0.57 eV. Similar to the first hydrogen addition step, at the initial state, both NH* and H* occupy opposing bridge sites with a hollow site between them. NH2* at the final state sits on the same bridge site as NH* at the initial state. The barrier for this step is 0.81 eV, which is about 0.1 eV higher than the barrier for NH* formation. At the transition state, the N–H distance is 1.63 Å. A similar transition state has been identified in other DFT studies. (87,99) While the first two hydrogenation steps are exothermic, the addition of the last hydrogen to NH2* is endothermic by 0.22 eV. Moreover, the minimum energy path for the final hydrogenation step is also very different from those for the two preceding hydrogenations. At the initial state of the CI-NEB calculation, both NH2* and H* are on top sites (across a bridge). The distance between N* and H* at the transition state is 1.96 Å. The barrier for NH3* formation is 1.38 eV, much higher than barriers for the formation of NH* (0.70 eV) and NH2* (0.81 eV). Previous studies reported a barrier of 1.33 eV for NH2 hydrogenation to NH3, (102) and also found this step to be the most highly activated among all the three hydrogenation steps. (87,99)
H2O Formation
Formation of H2O* from adsorbed O* involves two hydrogenation steps, R20 and R21. Step R20, O* + H* → OH* + *, is exothermic by 0.53 eV. The minimum energy path for this elementary step is quite similar to that for N* + H* → NH* + *. At the initial state, both O* and H* occupy two bridge sites (across a hollow site), and at the final state, OH* sits on the same bridge site as O* at the initial state, with the O–H bond tilted 71.7° from the surface normal. At the transition state, the O–H distance is 1.55 Å. The barrier for this elementary step is 0.49 eV, which is 0.35 eV lower than the barrier for the second hydrogenation step to form H2O. The H2O* formation minimum energy path is similar to that of NH3* formation. OH* and H* sit on two top sites at the initial state, and the HO–H bond forms over the adjoining bridge site with a bond length of 2.01 Å at the transition state. The long bond length at the transition state, approximately double the O–H bond length in H2O* (Table 2), is also found in the formation of NH3*.
Figure 5 shows the thermochemistry and activation energy barriers of elementary steps in the product formation mechanism. From this figure, we note that, from atomic N*, the barrier for N2* formation (0.45 eV) is lower than those for N2O* (0.75 eV) and NH* (0.70 eV). Therefore, on the basis of the DFT-derived energetics, N2 might be the major product in NO reduction by H2 on Pt(100). Experimental studies of the NO reduction by H2 reaction on platinum catalysts, however, suggested that N2O is the major product. (40,49) Several factors might lead to this apparent discrepancy between our DFT-predicted and experimentally observed major products. One particular parameter, the coverage of NO, has been identified as a key factor that affects the NO reduction mechanism, (73) and is discussed in the next section.

3.4. Phase Diagrams for NO Adsorption on Pt(100)
For the construction of a phase diagram for NO adsorption on Pt(100), the binding properties of NO at coverages of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 monolayer are studied. The most stable adsorption structure and NO differential binding energy at each coverage are shown in Figure 6. As discussed above, at a total coverage of 0.25 ML, NO* prefers to bind to a bridge site through its N atom, with a binding energy of −2.24 eV. At a total coverage of 0.50 ML, each (2 × 2) unit cell has two NO* molecules, both of which bind to bridge sites. The differential binding energy of the second NO is −2.02 eV. Eichler and Hafner reported a BE(NO) of −2.07 eV using PW91 functional at θ = 0.50 ML on Pt(100), (17) in excellent agreement with our findings. At the same coverage, Moussounda et al. reported a differential binding energy of −2.09 eV, similar to our calculated value. (117) The introduction of another NO* into the unit cell further increases the total coverage of NO* to 0.75 ML. This additional NO* also prefers to bind to a bridge site, the same as the other two NO* molecules. The differential binding energy of the third NO* is −0.95 eV, which agrees well with the previously reported value of −0.98 eV. (117) At the NO* coverage of 1.00 ML, all four NO adsorbates occupy bridge sites with perpendicular configurations. Therefore, the site preference for NO* adsorption on Pt(100) does not change with increasing coverage. The fourth NO* molecule has a differential binding energy of −0.84 eV. The average binding energy of all four NO adsorbates from our calculation is −1.51 eV, which is close to previously reported values of −1.64 (117) and −1.69 eV, (17) at the same coverage. We note that the NO differential binding energy decreases with increasing coverage, which is in accordance with previous experimental (15) and theoretical (17,117) studies of NO adsorption on Pt(100), and DFT studies of NO adsorption on Pt(111). (118)
Figure 6
Figure 6. Most stable configurations for NO adsorption on Pt(100), at coverages (θ) of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 ML. Top and bottom panels for each pair of images provide a cross section and an on-top view of the slabs, respectively. Differential binding energy of NO at each coverage is also provided below the respective images.
Using the methodology described in Computational Methods, we construct two phase diagrams to capture the NO adsorption behavior on Pt(100) under typical reaction conditions (e.g., temperature is 400 K, and NO partial pressure is 0.005 atm), as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a,b shows phase diagrams for NO adsorption as a function of NO partial pressure at T = 400 K, and as a function of temperature at a NO partial pressure of 0.005 atm, respectively. We note that, at T = 400 K, 0.50 ML NO is the most thermodynamically stable state on Pt(100) in the NO partial pressure range from as low as 10–6 to 0.96 atm, and that, at PNO = 0.005 atm, 0.50 ML NO is also thermodynamically more favorable than other states on Pt(100) in the temperature range ∼340–780 K. Using single crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC), Yeo et al. projected that the saturation coverage of NO on Pt(100) is 0.50 ML, which is exactly the most stable state on the basis of our phase diagrams. (15) This finding indicates that, under typical reaction conditions, the Pt(100) surface is most likely covered by 0.50 ML of NO molecules. Previous studies have shown that surface coverage is a very important parameter in catalytic reactions. At different coverages, surface species exhibit varied adsorption behavior, and elementary steps can have dramatically different energetics. (19,117,119−130) Therefore, we propose that the surface coverage of NO* should be explicitly accounted for in first-principles studies of NO reduction by H2. We have investigated surface coverage effects on the NO reduction by H2 on Pt(100) reaction mechanism by explicitly including 0.50 ML NO adsorbates in our calculations and determine that the reaction mechanism indeed changes. A detailed analysis of the reaction network on a 0.50 ML NO-covered Pt(100) surface model will be presented in a separate publication.

4. Conclusions
We presented a detailed periodic, self-consistent DFT (GGA-PW91) study of the NO reduction by H2 reaction mechanism on clean Pt(100). We found that the direct NO dissociation path is preferred to H-assisted paths via HNO*, NOH*, or HNOH* intermediates. The formation of N-containing products from atomic N* was also investigated, since N* is the product of NO dissociation. The combination of N* with N* to form N2 has a lower barrier than NH* and N2O* formation steps. Therefore, our computational results indicate that N2 might be the major product for NO reduction by H2 on clean Pt(100). Ab initio phase diagrams for NO adsorption on Pt(100) were then constructed, and these phase diagrams suggest that, under typical reaction conditions, the catalyst surface is most likely covered by half a monolayer of NO molecules. Surface coverage effects are explicitly studied using first-principles calculations and will be presented in a separate publication.

Figure 2. Transition-state configurations of elementary steps in the N–O activation mechanism on clean Pt(100). Top and bottom panels for each vertical pair of images provide a cross section and an on-top view of the transition state, respectively. Table 3 provides further geometric details for these structures.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Potential energy surface for the N–O activation mechanism on clean Pt(100). The reference zero of the energy scale corresponds to the energy of NO and H2 in the gas phase, and the clean Pt(100) slab, at infinite separation from each other. All species at each state are infinitely separated. Table 3 provides further details on the energetics for these elementary steps. The energetically most favorable path is the direct NO dissociation path (in bold, red).
