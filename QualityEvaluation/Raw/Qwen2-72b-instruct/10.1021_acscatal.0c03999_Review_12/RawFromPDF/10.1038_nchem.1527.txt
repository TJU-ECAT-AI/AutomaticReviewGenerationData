methane conversion probed by experiment
and theory

Developing efﬁcient catalytic processes to convert methane into useful feedstocks relies critically upon devising new
coupling processes that use abundant, thermodynamically ‘mild’ oxidants together with selective catalysts. We report here
on elemental sulfur as a promising ‘soft’ oxidant for selective methane conversion to ethylene over MoS2, RuS2, TiS2, PdS
and Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Experiments and density functional theory reveal that methane conversion is directly correlated
with surface metal–sulfur bond strengths. Surfaces with weakly bound sulfur are more basic and activate methane C–H
bonds more readily. In contrast, experimental and theoretical selectivities scale inversely with surface metal–sulfur bond
strengths, and surfaces with the strongest metal–sulfur bonds afford the highest ethylene selectivities. High CH4/S ratios,
short contact times and the provision of a support maximizes the coupling of CHx intermediates and selectivity to
ethylene, because these conditions yield surfaces with stronger metal–sulfur bonding (for example, Pd16S7), which
suppresses the over-oxidation of methane.
T
he anticipated long-term decline in petroleum reserves
coupled with increasing worldwide energy demands will
require alternative hydrocarbon feedstocks and conversion
processes to produce fuels and basic chemical intermediates such
as ethylene and propene1. Methane, the principal component of
natural gas, is proposed as a suitable alternative because of its abun-
dant reserves and high hydrogen:carbon ratio2–4. Although methane
steam reforming to give synthesis gas (CO þ H2)5,6—followed by
catalytic conversion to methanol and other oxygenates7,8 or
Fischer–Tropsch synthesis9—is widely practised, these routes are
highly capital-intensive. A direct, high-selectivity, one-step route for
the methane-to-oleﬁns process would therefore be highly desirable.
Signiﬁcant methane reserves are currently found in ‘stranded’
locations, and utilizing these reserves will require strategies for
their efﬁcient conversion to higher-value and/or more transportable
products10. Indeed, for methane to be a viable carbon feedstock,
more selective, less capital-intensive conversion processes are
needed—a true ‘grand challenge’11. To date, approaches explored
for the direct, large-scale chemical transformation of methane to
useful chemicals include aromatization12, oxyclorination13,14 and
oxidative coupling15. However, these processes all have recognized
limitations, including modest selectivities and yields, the require-
ment for corrosive reagents, heat management and temperature
control, and/or dependence on toxic halogenated intermediates.
The seemingly straightforward oxidative transformation of
methane with O2 is in principle an attractive approach15;
however, the yields to desired products are typically limited by
severe over-oxidation pathways. Desired targets such as methanol,
formaldehyde and ethylene are far more reactive with O2 than
methane, and are therefore rapidly converted into more thermo-
dynamically stable products, principally CO2. Furthermore, the
reactions with O2 are highly exothermic, and can increase local
temperatures within reactors by 150–300 8C, thereby presenting
signiﬁcant heat management and reactor design issues. New
catalytic
strategies
to
enhance
the
selective
conversion
of
methane to oleﬁns or to other value-added intermediates with
lower heat emission are therefore pivotal to developing viable
methane conversion processes16–23.
In comparison to O2, the thermodynamic driving force for
methane over-oxidation by S2 is signiﬁcantly less (it is a ‘softer’
oxidant; see Table 1 for a thermodynamic comparison of O2 and S2
as oxidants)24,25. This result arises primarily from the weaker C–S
and H–S bonds and the lower bond enthalpies of the expected inter-
mediates and products in comparison with those involving O2. Note
that the vapour-phase oxidative coupling of methane by sulfur (as
gaseous S2) to produce ethylene is entropically driven, and is exergo-
nic only at temperatures above 950 K (Table 1, reaction 6). The use of
sulfur as the oxidant in methane conversion may alleviate engineering
issues associated with the signiﬁcant local temperature excursions

that occur when O2 is used. The thermodynamic data show that selec-
tive catalytic oxidative coupling of methane by S2 should be possible if
methane can be activated selectively. Note that the over-oxidation of
methane to CS2 or other species (Table 1, reactions 7–10) is far less
favourable than the analogous over-oxidation by O2 (Table 1, reac-
tions 2–5), as summarized graphically in Fig. 1.
There is an extensive body of information concerning catalyst
structure and reactivity26–29 for the industrial desulfurization of
hydrocarbons over transition-metal sulﬁdes such as Co/MoS2 and
RuSx catalysts30–35. However, very few studies have reported catalytic
reactions involving elemental sulfur and saturated hydrocar-
bons36,37. Here, we report on the catalytic conversion of methane
to ethylene (as expressed in reaction 6 of Table 1), using elemental
sulfur as an oxidant over transition-metal sulﬁde catalysts.
Experimental results indicating promising selectivity are used
together with ﬁrst-principles quantum chemical calculations to
show that both the activation of methane and the selectivity of
the subsequent conversion to ethylene can be linearly correlated
with the catalyst metal–sulfur (M–S) bond strength (deﬁned here
as the energy to remove atomic sulfur as H2S from the sulﬁde
surface, using H2), and that the two relationships are inversely
related to one another. The sites that are most active for
methane activation involve weakly bound surface sulfur atoms,
which promote hydrogen abstraction, whereas those that are
most selective involve strongly bound surface sulfur atoms, which
facilitate hydrocarbon fragment coupling to C2 products and
suppress the over-oxidation of methane. Higher methane:sulfur
(CH4/S) feed ratios and higher temperatures enhance methane
conversion and ethylene selectivity, and at the same time appear
to reduce the active sulﬁde catalysts and increase the metal:sulfur
compositions at the surface. This in turn decreases overall conver-
sion while increasing the selectivity to ethylene. These insights
demonstrate that sulfur is a promising reagent for the selective
oxidative transformation of methane and should help guide the
discovery of even more selective catalytic materials. The highest
methane-to-ethylene selectivity is found here for supported PdSx
catalysts operating at relatively high temperatures, high CH4/S
ratios and short contact times.
Results and discussion
Catalytic reactions were carried out in a ﬂow reactor specially
designed to generate gaseous sulfur38 as S2 for reactions with
hydrocarbons,
using
argon
as
the
balance
gas
(see
Supplementary Section A1 for details). Figure 2 presents a
summary of methane conversion and ethylene selectivity data as
a function of temperature over a series of catalysts. Note that
these reactions are very clean and the only detectable carbon-con-
taining products observed in the efﬂuent stream are ethylene and
carbon disulﬁde. Control experiments included blank reactions in
quartz chip-packed reactor tubes. Passing methane through the
reactor at 1,173 K in the absence of sulfur produces negligible
amounts of ethylene. Although the reactions are carried out at
relatively high temperatures, there is no evidence of signiﬁcant
coke formation on the catalyst surfaces after reaction, as assayed
by UV–Raman spectroscopy39 and combustion analysis (for a
spent PdS catalyst operated for 4 h at 1,273 K, C ≤0.03 wt%),
and the mass balance in these processes is invariably .98%. Both
methane conversion and ethylene selectivity (reported as two
times the moles of ethylene produced/moles of methane reacted)
increase markedly with increasing reaction temperature for all cata-
lysts examined. The selectivity for ethylene is also strongly catalyst-
dependent (Fig. 2b), following the trend PdS . TiS2 . RuS2 .

substantially higher with rising temperatures. In contrast, both the
RuS2 and MoS2 catalysts exhibit very low ethylene selectivities—
lower than the selectivity measured in the ‘blank’ experiments
over the entire temperature range—because they efﬁciently catalyse
over-oxidation to CS2. A minimal ethylene yield is observed
for all catalysts at temperatures below ≏1,073 K. The absence
of detectable ethane and methanethiol formation over any of the
catalysts is in agreement with thermodynamic expectations that
the formation of these products is unfavourable under these con-
ditions (Table 1).
CHx coupling can conceivably occur either on the surface of the
catalyst or in the gas phase. The increased selectivity and conversion
with increasing temperature reported in Fig. 2 in principle supports
both surface as well as gas-phase CHx coupling pathways, because
increasing the temperature or conversion will increase CHx
species formation on the surface as well as in the gas phase. The
increase in selectivity that occurs when using less active catalysts,
however, would indicate that, regardless of where the actual CHx
coupling takes place, the key step involves CHx–S* bond weakening
to generate the active intermediates. Although we will explicitly
discuss the coupling of CHx–S* species on the surface, the results
are essentially the same if the coupling occurs in the gas phase, as
the desorption rate of CH3
· radicals from the surface is inversely
related to the CH3–S* bond strength and linearly related to the
M–S bond strengths.
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out to help understand the reaction pathways and
mechanisms, the nature of the active catalytic sites and the effects
of the catalyst, as well as the reaction conditions on methane conver-
sion and the selective formation of ethylene. Details concerning the
computational methods used, as well as the results for the initial
activation of methane, the subsequent C–H activation of other
CHx–S* intermediates, the coupling of surface hydrocarbon inter-
mediates (CHx–S*) to form ethylene, and the desorption of CHx
species from the surfaces are discussed in Supplementary Sections
B1, B2. The coupling of CHx intermediates was explored on the
surface as well as in the gas phase.
Detailed structural optimizations were carried out on the close-
packed 111, 100 and 110 surfaces of MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS
over a range of sulfur coverages to establish the lowest energy struc-
tures of the surfaces at different temperatures and CH4/S ratios. The
results for these model MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS surfaces (shown
in Supplementary Fig. S5) were used to determine the most
favourable surface termination at speciﬁc sulfur chemical potentials
and temperatures. As has been shown previously for methane oxi-
dation, the chemical potential sets the composition of the surface
as well as the nature of the active surface sites40,41. The lowest
energy states and compositions for all of these structures were sub-
sequently used to calculate the reaction energies and barriers for
methane activation and the subsequent coupling of hydrocarbon
fragments to form ethylene. These results suggest that under
nearly all experimental conditions, MoS2, RuS2, TiS2 and PdS are
highly sulﬁded and the active sites comprise S–S pairs. The sole
exception, as will be discussed below, occurs at high temperatures
and high CH4/S ratios where theory and experiment indicate that
PdS is reduced to Pd16S7.
The rate of methane conversion is controlled by the activation of
the initial CH3–H bond, whereas catalytic selectivity for ethylene is
controlled by the rate of coupling of two bound methylene (CH2–S*)
fragments to form ethylene versus the rate of further C–H bond
activation to ultimately form CS2. The calculated transition states
for CH3–H activation over S–S sites and the coupling of CH2–S*
fragments to form ethylene are shown in Fig. 3 and involve charac-
teristic hydrogen abstraction and reductive C–C formation steps,
respectively. Both reactions are strongly inﬂuenced by the M–S
bond strength, which sets the basicity and reactivity of the surface
sulfur sites. Weaker M–S bonds can readily abstract hydrogen and
bind the resulting methyl groups more strongly, thus enhancing
the activation of methane, whereas strong M–S bonds result in
weaker C–S bonds, which enhance C–C coupling and increase the
selectivity to form ethylene. The barriers for both the C–H bond
activation of methane and the subsequent coupling of CH2
surface intermediates to form ethylene appear to be linearly
related to the M–S bond strength, as shown in Fig. 4.
The computed barriers for methane activation over the different
metal sulﬁdes reported in Fig. 4 increase with increasing M–S bond
strength as MoS2 . RuS2 ≈PdS . TiS2 and directly track the

experimental low-temperature conversion results in Fig. 2a.
Although entropy has a signiﬁcant effect on the reaction rate at
high reaction temperatures, the changes in entropy that result
from changes in the sulﬁde are very small and can be neglected
without loss of generality. Methane activation is governed by a
hydrogen abstraction, for which the reactant and transition-state
structures for all of the sulﬁdes examined were nearly identical.
Methane conversion is clearly governed by the M–S bond
strength. Sulﬁdes with weaker M–S bonds result in more basic
and reactive sulfur sites that can readily abstract hydrogen in the
transition state and bind the resulting CH3 and hydrogen inter-
mediates. Subsequent C–H activations of the resulting CHx*
species have lower activation barriers and more favourable acti-
vation entropies than those for methane, and are therefore more
reactive. As such, metal sulﬁdes with weaker M–S bonds will not
only readily activate the C–H bond of methane, but will continue
on to activate the C–H bonds of the subsequent CHx fragments
and ultimately mediate over-oxidation to CS2. The calculations
for C–H activation at CH3*–S, CH2*–S and CH*–S sites on
MoS2 yield barriers of 119, 63 and 178 kJ mol21, respectively,
which are signiﬁcantly lower than the initial 184 kJ mol21 barrier
for methane activation.
In contrast to these results, computed trends in the methane-to-
ethylene selectivity are inversely related to M–S bond strength, as
also shown in Fig. 4, where the barriers for ethylene formation
decrease as MoS2 . RuS2 . PdS . TiS2. These results are consistent
with the experimental results shown in Fig. 2b at temperatures
below 1,175 K, with the exception that PdS is only slightly more
selective than TiS2. Similar results for selectivity are found if the
CH3
· radicals desorb from the surface and recombine in the gas
phase to form ethane, because the CH3
· desorption barriers are lin-
early correlated with the CH2–S* coupling barriers, as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S12. The barriers to activate the C–H bonds
of CH3–S* intermediates and subsequently couple the CH2–S*
species to form ethylene are both lower than the barriers for CH3
·
radical desorption, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S12. This
suggests that CH2–S* coupling on the surface is more favourable
than the desorption and gas-phase coupling of CH3
· radicals.
A more detailed analysis of the C–H bond activation steps versus
the CH2–S*...CH2–S* coupling reactions indicates that the M–S
bond becomes sufﬁciently strong in PdS and TiS2 to begin to
reverse the driving force to over-oxidize to CS2 and instead increases
the likelihood of CH2–S* coupling to form ethylene. On PdS, the
barrier to CH2–S* coupling to form ethylene is 183 kJ mol21,
which is only 50 kJ mol21 greater than the barrier to activate the
C–H bond of CH2–S* (134 kJ mol21). Note, however, that the
change in entropy for CH2–S* coupling is signiﬁcantly more favour-
able than that for C–H bond activation. At higher temperatures,
both steps become favourable. On TiS2, the CH2–S* coupling
process is computed to be far more favourable than the C–H acti-
vation of CH2–S* species.
Further examination of the experimental results in Fig. 2b indi-
cates that although the selectivity to ethylene increases with increas-
ing temperature for all of the sulﬁdes, the results for PdS are
characteristically different because the selectivity increases far
more dramatically with temperature than for the other sulﬁdes.
As can be seen in Fig. 2a, there also appears to be a distinct
change in the relative experimental ordering of methane activation
over the different metal sulﬁdes at temperatures above ≏1,150 K.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the PdS catalyst before and after
operation at high temperatures are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2A and compared with PDF (Powder Diffraction File)
database spectra for PdS (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and Pd16S7
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data suggest that the bulk of the
PdS is reduced to Pd16S7 under catalytic reaction conditions.
Similar XRD characterization of the initial and spent MoS2 catalysts
(Supplementary Fig. S3) reveals that these remain unchanged under
all reaction conditions.
The CH4/S ratio is found to be a critical parameter governing
selectivity in the present catalytic conversions over PdS. The
experimental results in Fig. 5a show that over-oxidation of
methane to CS2 is suppressed at high CH4/S ratios, thereby
enhancing ethylene selectivity. In reactant streams with CH4/S
ratios less than 1:1, ethylene formation is suppressed, and CS2 is
the only observed carbon-containing product. The dependence of
selectivity on the CH4/S ratio logically follows because over-
oxidation is stoichiometrically more favourable at high oxidant
concentrations. The increasing ethylene selectivity with increasing
CH4/S over PdS is consistent with the experimental results
presented in Fig. 2b, which show a signiﬁcant increase in selectivity
with increasing temperature. Both higher temperatures and higher
CH4/S ratios lead to the reduction of PdS to Pd16S7. The results
clearly show that the more reduced Pd16S7 state is less active but
signiﬁcantly more selective for ethylene. Similar phase changes
between PdO and oxygen-covered Pd metal, and concomitant
decreases in the rate of catalytic methane activation, have been

reported for methane oxidation with increasing CH4:O2 ratios
and temperatures42.
To increase catalyst dispersion and possibly enhance catalytic
performance,
a
ZrO2-supported
10 wt%
palladium
catalyst
(Pd/ZrO2) was synthesized and evaluated. As can be seen in
Fig. 6, both methane conversion and ethylene selectivity are sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced over those for bulk PdS, with ethylene selec-
tivity now approaching 20%. Considering that the palladium
loading in Pd/ZrO2 catalysts is ≏10% that of bulk PdS catalysts,
we infer that Pd/ZrO2 exhibits signiﬁcantly higher efﬁciency in
methane conversion to ethylene. Furthermore, examination using
XRD indicates that the palladium in Pd/ZrO2 is converted to
Pd16S7 after ≏2 h on stream (Supplementary Fig. S4B), in agree-
ment with the observation that, after a short initial period,
Pd/ZrO2
catalytic
performance
is
stable
for
at
least
24 h
(Supplementary Fig. S4A).
DFT-computed phase diagrams for Pd16S7 (Supplementary
Fig. S15) indicate that higher temperatures and higher CH4/S
ratios result in stable sulfur-terminated 110 and 111 surfaces that
expose Pd–S site pairs with M–S bond strengths of 167 kJ mol21,
which is 55 kJ mol21 greater than the M–S bond strengths on
PdS. Despite the stronger M–S bonding, methane can be readily
activated at the Pd–S sites in a four-centre transition state via a s-
bond metathesis-type mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S17) with
a barrier of 166 kJ mol21. Although the initial methane molecule
is activated at this site and continues to form CH2*, the coupling
of two CH2* surface intermediates requires the activation of a
second methane molecule at a vicinal S–S site pair. The large Pd–
S bond strength at these vicinal S–S sites increases the methane acti-
vation barriers at these sites to 241 kJ mol21 (Supplementary
Fig. S16), which is 34 kJ mol21 greater than for the Pd–S bonds
present on the PdS surface. These strong M–S bonds also signiﬁ-
cantly weaken the CH2–S* bonding and lower the barriers for sub-
sequent coupling of the CH2–S* intermediates to form ethylene
(Supplementary
Fig.
S18)
to
only
103 kJ mol21,
which
is
80 kJ mol21 lower than that on PdS. This situation signiﬁcantly
enhances the selectivity to ethylene on the reduced Pd16S7 surface
compared with that on the other metal sulﬁdes examined, and
raises important implications for future catalyst design.
The resulting C–H activation and CH2–CH2 coupling barriers
over
the
Pd16S7
surface
S–S
pairs
track
very
closely
the
aforementioned linear correlation with M–S bond strength, and
are plotted together with the barriers for all the highly sulﬁded sur-
faces in Fig. 4. The resulting barriers are fully consistent with the
experimental results, showing that the Pd16S7 catalytic material
has lower activity than the other sulﬁdes but proceeds with mark-
edly higher selectivity to ethylene at higher temperatures (Fig. 1)
and at higher CH4/S ratios (Fig. 5).
To better understand the methane over-oxidation pathways in
the present catalytic systems, methane conversion and ethylene
selectivity over the PdS catalysts were also studied as a function of
weight hour space velocity (WHSV; Fig. 5b). At high WHSV,
where the residence time in the catalyst bed is short, selectivity to
ethylene is signiﬁcantly enhanced, but over-oxidation to CS2
becomes more pronounced at longer residence times and is reason-
ably attributable to follow-up reactions of ethylene with S2 to form
CS2. This scenario was veriﬁed in control experiments.
Conclusions
The results reported here demonstrate that sulfur is a promising
‘soft’ oxidant for the heterogeneous catalytic conversion of
methane to ethylene because the M–S bonds are signiﬁcantly stron-
ger than the M–O bonds in the corresponding O2 oxidations. Lower
(more controlled) conversions of methane as well as higher selectiv-
ities of methane to ethylene conversion are observed here on sulﬁdes
with the strongest surface M–S bonds. High CH4/S ratios and high
WHSVs promote favourable conversion selectivity to ethylene and
suppress undesired over-oxidation pathways. MoS2, RuS2, TiS2
and PdS are effective catalysts for methane conversion to ethylene
and/or CS2 using sulfur as the oxidant. However, activity and selec-
tivity are strongly catalyst-dependent, with the partially reduced PdS
in the form of bulk or ZrO2-supported Pd16S7 exhibiting the highest
selectivity. Although the selectivities to ethylene in these prelimi-
nary experiments are currently modest, it is likely that they will be
increased substantially following optimization of conditions and
catalysts. These results demonstrate that metal sulﬁdes and, more
generally, transition-metal chalcogenides, offer the ability to sub-
stantially control the conversion and selective oxidation of
methane to ethylene by sulfur. Furthermore, using S2 as the
oxidant rather than O2 should suppress the dramatic temperature
excursions that occur in oxidative methane coupling with O2,
because the S2 reactions are nearly thermoneutral. This should

removal. Note also that the H2S produced in the present catalytic
coupling can be used to regenerate the sulfur feedstock by means
of the efﬁcient, industrially practised Claus process43:
2H2S + O2  S2 + 2H2O
In essence, sulfur serves in the present approach as a redox mediator
for O2 oxidation.
Methods
A custom heterogeneous catalytic reactor (fabricated by Altamira Instruments) was
designed for using elemental sulfur as a gaseous reactant for the oxidative coupling
of methane. Typical reactions were carried out between 1,073 and 1,323 K with a 5%
methane stream, using argon as the balance gas. Blank tests were carried out under
identical reaction conditions using an empty reactor ﬁlled with quartz chips. The
metal sulﬁde catalysts MoS2, TiS2, RuS2 and PdS were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, and were used without further puriﬁcation. The WHSV was
varied between 6,000 and 30,000 ml h21 g21 by adjusting the amount of catalyst in
the reactor from 500 to 100 mg. All the reactions were carried out under ambient
pressure. Reaction products were monitored online and quantiﬁed using a gas
chromatograph with ﬂame photometric detection (FPD), thermal conductivity
detection (TCD) and ﬂame ionization detection (FID) detectors. A more detailed
description of the reaction setup and catalyst characterization is provided in
Supplementary Sections A1, A2.
