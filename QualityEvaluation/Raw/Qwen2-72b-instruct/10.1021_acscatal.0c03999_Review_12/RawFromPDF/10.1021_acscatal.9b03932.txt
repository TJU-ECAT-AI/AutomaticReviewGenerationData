Abstract
The modular structure of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) makes them promising platforms for catalyst design and for elucidating structure/performance relationships in catalysis. In this work, we systematically varied the composition of the metal nodes (Fe2M) of the MOF PCN-250 and used density functional theory (DFT) to identify promising catalysts for light alkane C–H bond activation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes was studied using N2O as the oxidant to understand the reactivity of the oxocentered Fe2M nodes found in PCN-250, where the Fe ions are in the +3 oxidation state and M is a metal with the oxidation state of +2. We show that the N2O activation barrier is positively correlated with the oxygen-binding energy at the metal center, and the C–H activation barrier is negatively correlated with this same quantity. For clusters containing early transition metals, oxygen binds strongly, facilitating N2O activation but hindering C–H activation. To validate the DFT predictions, we synthesized and tested PCN-250(Fe2M) with M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and found that PCN-250(Fe2Mn) and PCN-250(Fe3) are more active than PCN-250(Fe2Co) and PCN-250(Fe2Ni) in agreement with the DFT predictions, demonstrating the power of DFT calculations to predict and identify promising MOF catalysts for alkane C–H bond activation in advance of experiments.

Introduction
Due to increasing natural gas production, many researchers are seeking catalysts that can activate the inert C–H bonds found in light alkanes as a way to upgrade natural gas into liquid fuels and value-added chemicals. (1) Of particular interest are the direct conversion of methane to methanol, to bypass the industrial two-step process through a syngas intermediate, (2)and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to meet increasing demand for propylene. (3) To accelerate catalyst discovery, first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT) can be used to computationally model the activity of promising catalysts and develop structure–activity relationships to guide experimental efforts. (4) Cation-exchanged zeolites, especially those containing Cu-oxo sites, have attracted significant interest for methane partial oxidation, (5) and based on modeling, their activity has been related to descriptors such as the hydrogen addition energy (6) and the formation energy of the hydrogen-abstracting oxygen site. (7) However, the structures of these active sites are often difficult to characterize experimentally, and debates about the active site, such as the number of copper atoms in it, are still ongoing for a number of zeolite frameworks. (5,8,9) Mixed-metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx, supported on silica, alumina, and others (3) have been extensively studied for propane ODH, but the surface structure and active site responsible for C–H bond activation are not well-known. (10)
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for catalysis (11−15) and are starting to attract attention for challenging reactions such as C–H bond activation. (13,16) Their modular structure consisting of nodes and linkers of known structure and composition makes them attractive platforms for catalyst screening and tailoring of their catalytic properties. MOFs containing coordinatively unsaturated transition-metal sites are particularly interesting for their potential redox activity. The coordination environment of the open metal sites, such as in Fe-MOF-74, (16,17) can promote the formation of metal-oxo moieties that can activate the C–H bond in light alkanes, and recent work in our group found that the binding energy of oxygen to such metal sites is inversely related to the ability of the MOF to activate the C–H bond in methane. (18)
Several families of MOFs with open transition-metal sites contain trimetallic nodes with the chemical composition M23+M2+/3+(μ3-O)(X)(RCOO)6 (where M represents the metal sites, X represents a counteranion that may be present, and R represents the remaining part of the organic linker). These oxocentered trigonal-prismatic building units appear in MOFs such as MIL-100(Fe3, Cr3), (19,20) MIL-101(Fe3, Cr3), (21,22) and PCN-250(Fe2Mn, Fe3, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni). (23,24) The undercoordinated open metal sites found in these trimetallic nodes (25−28) make this class of MOFs attractive for oxidation catalysis. For instance, MIL-100(Fe3 and Cr3) and MIL-101(Fe3 and Cr3) are active toward the allylic oxidation of alkenes, oxidation of cyclohexane and cyclohexene, and aerobic oxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons. (25,28) In the trimetallic node, two of the metal centers are always trivalent, and the third metal can be divalent or trivalent if a monovalent counteranion is present (typically OH–, F–, or Cl–). The coordination of each metal center is square pyramidal when the metal site is open or octahedral with a bound counteranion or solvent. All metal centers are linked to a central oxygen atom and bridged by carboxylate groups that belong to the linkers of the MOF. Variations of this trimetallic cluster have also been synthesized and widely studied in the inorganic chemistry field for their magnetic properties with metals including Al, V, Cr, and Fe. (29,30) MOFs with these nodes have also been explored for catalysis via modeling, such as recent work by Vitillo and co-workers. (31)
In this work, we study the reactivity of PCN-250 (Fe2Mn, Fe3, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni). (23,24) The diverse, mixed-metal composition and facile (24,29,32,33) synthesis of the preformed trimetallic inorganic node make these MOFs an attractive platform to systematically study the effect of the node composition on the catalytic properties of the MOF and to develop structure–function relationships. We used DFT calculations to examine metal-substituted variations of PCN-250 where the divalent metal is varied across the first row of transition metals to develop structure–function relationships and guide experimental testing. We modeled the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the partial oxidation of propane to propanol, and we experimentally confirmed the predicted activity trends of PCN-250 variants toward light alkane C–H activation.
Results
DFT Predictions for the Catalytic Activity of PCN-250
The structure of PCN-250(Fe2M) consists of trimetallic nodes of composition Fe2M bridged by tetratopic azobenzene-based ABTC linkers (ABTC = 3,3′,5,5′-azobenzenetetracarboxylate) to produce a soc net (Figure 1a), where M = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni. (23) The Fe atoms are in the +3 oxidation state, and the remaining M atom is in the +2 oxidation state for the resting state of the catalyst. We examined the catalytic activity of the trimetallic Fe2M node of PCN-250 upon replacing the M site with divalent first-row transition-metal ions (Ti–Zn). Because the unit cell of PCN-250 consists of over 400 atoms and we are primarily concerned with the tunability and activity of the node, we represent the node of PCN-250 with the cluster model shown in Figure 1c and replace the linkers with formate ions. We show in Section S2 of the Supporting Information that the reaction barrier energies differ by less than 12 kJ/mol if the benzene rings of the ABTC linker of PCN-250 are also included.

The crystal structure of PCN-250(Fe3) was obtained from ref (23) as provided in the Cambridge Structural Database.
Alkane oxidation over the open metal sites in PCN-250 is proposed to occur via the following steps: activation of the oxidant to create an oxidized active site, C–H bond activation, formation and release of the product(s), and reoxidation of the active site. N2O has been used as the oxidant in several experimental studies of alkane partial oxidation due to its demonstrated selectivity, (16,35−37) and the mechanism by which N2O is activated is well-known and has also been studied particularly for methane and ethane partial oxidation. (17,38) Therefore, we use N2O as the oxidant in both our computational and experimental studies of oxidation catalysis by PCN-250. After formation of the metal-oxo active site, activation of secondary C–H bonds can lead to an alkene via oxidative dehydrogenation or to an alcohol via oxygen transfer (radical rebound). In our DFT studies, we examined the activation of propane, the smallest molecule with secondary C–H bonds.
The proposed catalytic cycle for propane oxidation over PCN-250 variants is shown in Figure 2. N2O first adsorbs on the open metal site of Fe2M (1) and N2O is activated (TS1), forming a metal-oxo moiety (16) (2) as the oxygen atom from N2O oxidizes the metal. In the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway, the alkane undergoes two hydrogen abstractions by the metal-oxo moiety to form the alkene and water. The oxidized cluster (2) first abstracts a secondary hydrogen during the first C–H activation step (TS2), forming an alkyl radical and a bound hydroxyl group on the metal site (3). The newly formed hydroxyl group abstracts a second hydrogen (TS3) to produce a bound water molecule and a physisorbed alkene (4). The alkene then desorbs, leaving a bound water molecule (5a). Finally, water desorbs to reform the open metal site (1), completing the catalytic cycle. We also consider the possibility that the alkyl radical (3) can attack the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group, forming a bound alcohol molecule (5b), which can desorb to regenerate the open metal site (1).

Figure 3 shows the computed Gibbs free energy along the reaction pathway at 250 °C for the Fe3 cluster as a representative result for the entire series of Fe2M clusters. For the Fe3 cluster, we obtained an energy barrier of 147 kJ/mol to activate N2O (species 1_N2O to TS1) and 20.6 kJ/mol (2_C3H8 to TS2) for the initial C–H bond activation. Our result for the N2O activation barrier (electronic energy; see Figure S16a) agrees with the previously reported barrier for the partial oxidation of methane and ethane on Fe3 MOF nodes within 5 kJ/mol. (32) The N2O activation barrier for our system is higher in energy by 65 kJ/mol compared to what has been previously reported on Fe-MOF-74. (17) Our result for the C–H bond activation energy is 40–80 kJ/mol lower than those reported for ethane and methane in MOF screening and Fe-MOF studies due to the weaker secondary C–H bond in propane. (17,18,32) For the subsequent C–H bond cleavage that leads to the alkene, we were unable to find a transition state for Fe3 and observed low barriers for other clusters, as discussed in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). We assume this to be due to the instability of the alkyl radical intermediate, and as such, the activation of the C–H bond on the radical is not discussed further in this manuscript and is omitted in Figure 3. The alkene product forms and desorbs favorably with a downhill energy of −29 kJ/mol (4 to 5a), but water binds strongly to the node, with a desorption free energy of 51 kJ/mol (5a to 1). The alternative formation of the bound alcohol (5b) is thermodynamically more favorable than forming the bound alkene and water (4) by 40 kJ/mol, but desorption of the alcohol is 43 kJ/mol uphill in free energy (5b to 1) at 250 °C. The strong adsorption of the alcohol is consistent with observations in cation-exchanged zeolites (39,40) and MOFs, (16,41) which also contributes to the selective but stoichiometric conversion of methane to methanol in those systems. (7,42,43) Our calculations also show that the alkene product desorbs favorably during the ODH pathway, while the water molecule exhibits an unfavorable desorption from the node even at 250 °C. As such, we expect to observe experimentally the formation of the alkene product and water and alcohol molecules to contribute to catalyst inhibition, since they are more likely to remain bound to the framework due to their unfavorable desorption energies.

All atoms are shown as spheres, with the exception of the hydrogen-terminated formate bridges, which are represented as tubes. The species are labeled as follows: (1) the bare cluster, (1_N2O) adsorbed N2O, (TS1) N2O activation, (2) the oxidized cluster, (2_C3H8) adsorbed propane, (TS2) first C–H activation, (3) adsorbed propyl radical, (4) adsorbed propene and water, (5a) adsorbed water, and (5b) adsorbed propanol. The formation of propene and water from the radical species 3 is shown in red, and the formation of the alcohol is shown in blue. Enthalpy and electronic energy profiles are shown in Figure S16.
For those clusters that contain two different types of metals, we modeled the reactivity on both metal sites (Figures S12–S20). To understand the reactivity trends among all clusters, we focused on the N2O and C–H activation barriers represented by the energy difference from species 1 to TS1 and from species 2 to TS2, respectively. As shown in Figure 4a, the N2O activation energy increases across the periodic table from Fe2Ti to Fe2Zn whether the reaction occurs on the Fe site or the M site and ranges from 90 kJ/mol (Fe2Ti) to 310 kJ/mol (Fe2Cu). The C–H activation barrier on the M═O site decreases across the periodic table and ranges from 162 kJ/mol (Fe2V) to 14 kJ/mol (Fe2Zn), as shown in Figure 4b in gray. However, for C–H activation on the Fe═O site, as the spectator metal M is varied periodically from Ti to Zn, we observe only a weak trend in the C–H activation barrier, which ranges from 28 to 70 kJ/mol (purple in Figure 4b). This shows that the C–H activation appears to depend mostly on the identity of the M═O moiety, and the spectator metal has little effect on the reactivity of the Fe═O site for C–H activation. During hydrogen abstraction, Fe4+═O is reduced to Fe3+═O with the transfer of one electron to the d orbitals of the Fe metal site. In contrast, the N2O activation involves the transfer of two electrons. When the N2O activation occurs on a Fe3+ site, the spectator metal can influence the reactivity of the cluster by donating an electron and becoming oxidized as well, as the Fe3+ site is less likely to become oxidized to Fe5+ (Section S8 and Table S16). Propene desorption across all clusters is favorable and ranges from −34 to −23 kJ/mol in free energy (Figure S24). Propanol desorption on the Fe and M sites is unfavorable and ranges from 32 to 62 kJ/mol (excluding the Cu site of Fe2Cu) (Figure S25). Water desorption is unfavorable as well and ranges from 38 to 67 kJ/mol (again excluding the Cu site of Fe2Cu) (Figure S26). The Cu site of Fe2Cu is an outlier for both propanol and water desorption and shows anomalously low desorption energies.

Oxygen-Binding Energy as a Reactivity Descriptor
Theoretical findings within the zeolite literature, (7) a recent study on Fe complexes, (44) and previous work in our group on MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (18) find that the stability and thermodynamic favorability of the oxo moiety that activates alkane C–H bonds is inversely proportional to its reactivity toward hydrogen abstraction. A more unstable M═O abstracts a hydrogen more easily. Thus, the binding energy of oxygen to the cluster, also referred to as the oxo formation energy, is a relevant characteristic for understanding reactivity trends among the clusters.
Here, we compute the binding energy of oxygen as the stability of the oxidized cluster (2) relative to the bare node (1) and N2O. Negative free-energy and enthalpy values correspond to exergonic and exothermic oxo formation.

We use N2O as a reference rather than triplet O2, which is commonly used in the literature. Using N2O rather than triplet O2 simply shifts the energy by 25 kJ/mol. The binding energy of oxygen correlates well with the N2O activation barrier whether the N2O activation occurs on the Fe or M site (Figure S27a). In addition, the N2O activation barrier also correlates inversely with the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for each of the bare clusters (Figure S31), implying that as the energy level of the HOMO increases, the cluster donates electrons more easily and a stronger bond is formed between the cluster and oxygen, facilitating the N2O activation.
From the oxygen-binding free energies, we can predict which site (Fe or M) is preferentially oxidized on each of the clusters. The results are shown in Figure 5a. Generally, oxygen prefers to bind to the M site for clusters containing the earlier first-row transition metals (Ti, V, and Cr) and prefers to bind to the Fe site for those containing the later transition metals (Ni, Cu, and Zn). In the case of Fe2Mn, oxygen binds nearly equally to the Fe and Mn sites. A greater population of M═O or Fe═O moieties will be present depending on where oxygen preferentially binds, and an equal amount of nodes with oxygen bound to the Fe or Mn site is expected for Fe2Mn.
Figure 5
Figure 5. (a) Preference of oxygen to bind to the Fe or M site, represented by the difference between the binding free energies of oxygen on the M site (ΔGM═O) and on the Fe site (ΔGFe═O). A negative value corresponds to a favorable binding to the M site and a positive value corresponds to a favorable binding on the Fe site. (b) Correlation between the oxygen-binding energy and the N2O activation barrier (blue) and the C–H activation barrier (red). We calculate the N2O activation barrier from 1 to TS1 and the C–H activation barrier from 2 to TS2. The squares and circles correspond to the reaction occurring on the Fe site and M site of the cluster, respectively. All calculated energies are free energies at 250 °C. Figure S29 shows the correlations with energies calculated as electronic energies with zero-point energy corrections and the N2O activation and C–H activation barriers calculated from 1_N2O to TS1 and from 2_C3H8 to TS2, respectively.
Figure 5b shows that there are strong correlations between the binding energy of oxygen and (1) the N2O activation barrier (in blue) and (2) the C–H activation barrier (in red) for our system. In all cases, Figure 5b shows results for the site (Fe or M) that binds oxygen more favorably based on thermodynamics (results for all sites are shown in Figure S28). As the oxygen-binding free energy becomes more endergonic, the N2O barrier increases and the C–H activation barrier decreases. With the exception of Fe2Ti and Fe2V, the N2O activation energy is higher than the C–H activation barrier on all clusters. The trends in Figure 5b demonstrate that the substitution of the M site with the later first-row transition metals weakens the oxygen-binding energy to the trimetallic node, and a weaker bonding interaction between the oxygen and the node facilitates the hydrogen abstraction step. For example, the most active clusters toward C–H abstraction (Fe2Ni, Fe2Cu and Fe2Zn) have Fe═O bond orders that fall between a single bond and a double bond, and the least active toward C–H abstraction (Fe2Ti, Fe2V, and Fe2Cr) have M═O bond orders that fall between a double bond and a triple bond (Figure S32). Because Ti and V prefer an oxidation state of +4, oxygen binds more strongly to these sites, causing the C–H cleavage to be more difficult. On the other hand, because Ni and Zn are more unstable in an oxidation state of +4, oxygen prefers to bind to Fe.
The linear correlations for the N2O and C–H activation barriers intersect at an oxygen-binding free energy of −140 kJ/mol (ΔH = −190 kJ/mol), so that the C–H activation becomes the highest barrier for materials with an oxygen-binding free energy that is more endergonic than −140 kJ/mol. The materials expected to perform the best overall are those closer to this intersection, which corresponds to Fe2Ti and Fe2V. Because Ti and V are not stable in the +2 state, we believe it may be experimentally difficult to synthesize MOFs with these node compositions. Furthermore, although MOFs such as Ti-MOF-74 and V-MOF-74 have been computationally found to perform better than other M-MOF-74 analogues for N2/CH4 separation, they are yet to be synthesized. (45,46) We therefore focused our attention on MOFs that can be more readily synthesized, namely, PCN-250(Fe2Mn, Fe3, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni). For these materials, the highest barrier is the N2O activation, and the barrier for C–H activation is 100– 200 kJ/mol lower. Thus, we predict the following order of reactivity toward the oxidation of species with a secondary C–H bond: PCN-250(Fe2Mn) ∼ PCN-250(Fe3) > PCN-250(Fe2Co) > PCN-250(Fe2Ni). Based on our predictions, we demonstrated this trend experimentally as described in the next section.
Experimental Testing of PCN-250
Samples of PCN-250(Fe2Mn, Fe3, Fe2Co, and Fe2Ni) were synthesized following literature procedures. (23) The materials are fully consistent with prior published results, as described in the Supporting Information (Section S9). These materials were tested in the vapor-phase oxidation of cyclohexane by N2O at 250 °C (Figures S35 and S36). Given that the DFT-predicted reactivity trends were predicated on rate-limiting N2O activation, cyclohexane was used in 10:1 excess to help ensure rapid utilization of the oxidized form of the active site. Cyclohexane has a number of advantages for use as a reactant in alkane oxidation studies. (47−50) It has only a single type of C–H bond that facilitates comparison to theory, its relatively large size makes all products readily detected by gas chromatography even at low conversions, and its C–H bond dissociation energy is the same as that of propane to within ∼1 kcal/mol. (51,52) Most importantly, overoxidation of cyclohexane leads to additional detectable products, such as benzene, in the case of ODH. This provides additional mechanistic information vs molecules such as propane, where overoxidation leads to CO2.
Over 7 h time on stream, cyclohexene and benzene were the only significant products, with trace levels of CO2 as the overoxidation product. Plotting the reaction selectivity against instantaneous conversion in Figure 6a, the intrinsic reaction selectivity is calculated by extrapolation to zero conversion. PCN-250(Fe3) and PCN-250(Fe2Mn) have near 100% intrinsic selectivity to cyclohexene, while PCN-250(Fe2Co) and PCN-250(Fe2Ni) have 93–95% intrinsic selectivity to cyclohexene, with the remainder being benzene. The catalysts decrease moderately in selectivity with increasing conversion to form the benzene overoxidation product without significant CO2 formation.

(b) Comparison of the experimental pseudosteady rates of cyclohexane ODH (represented by the point plot and left y-axis) and DFT-predicted N2O activation energies calculated from the difference between the Gibbs free energies of 1 and TS1 at 250 °C (represented by bars and right y-axis) on PCN-250(Fe3) (black), PCN-250(Fe2Mn) (blue), PCN-250(Fe2Co) (red), and PCN-250(Fe2Ni) (green). Figure S37 in the Supporting Information shows the comparison with the oxygen-binding energy.
Figure 6b compares the experimental rate of cyclohexene formation after each of the catalysts approaches steady state to the DFT-predicted N2O activation energies. Recall that N2O activation is predicted to be rate limiting for these catalysts. Rates are plotted as turnover frequencies assuming that each node is an active site. As predicted from the N2O activation energies, the catalytic turnover frequencies follow the trend PCN-250(Fe2Mn) ∼ PCN-250(Fe3) > PCN-250(Fe2Co) > PCN-250(Fe2Ni). For PCN-250(Fe3) and PCN-250(Fe2Ni), we predict the reaction to occur on the Fe site of both MOFs (Figure 5a). Computationally, we show that replacing the spectator metal from Fe to Ni can substantially increase the DFT-computed N2O activation barrier on the Fe site by 74 kJ/mol. This is further validated by the experimental results, which show that the rate of reaction on PCN-250(Fe2Ni) is reduced by more than half of the rate of reaction on PCN-250(Fe3) (7.2 vs 16.9 mmolproduct/(molnode min), respectively). DFT calculations are often used to explain results in catalysis after the initial experimental work. This work is a rare case of predictions from DFT being performed before experiments and then validated in the lab afterward. The ability to make predictions, even for difficult alkane C–H activation reactions, is facilitated by the uniformity and tunability of the metal sites in this family of MOFs, demonstrating the power of theory for MOF catalysis.
Conclusions
In this work, we used DFT to model the mixed-metal nodes of PCN-250 (Fe2M) MOFs and predict their reactivity toward oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using N2O as the oxidant. We showed computationally that the N2O and C–H activation barriers are correlated with the oxygen-binding energy for a series of Fe2M clusters (where M = Ti–Zn) that are representative of the node of PCN-250. As the oxygen-binding energy becomes more favorable, the N2O activation barrier is lower, and the C–H activation energy is higher. The N2O activation barrier is correlated with the HOMO energy as well; as the HOMO energy of the cluster increases, the cluster donates electrons more easily and binds oxygen more strongly, facilitating N2O activation. For those PCN-250(Fe2M) MOFs whose crystal structures already exist in the literature (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni), the N2O activation barrier is higher than the C–H activation barrier. Our calculations predict that their reactivity follows the trend PCN-250(Fe2Mn) ∼ PCN-250(Fe3) > PCN-250(Fe2Co) > PCN-250(Fe2Ni) based on the N2O barrier height, and we subsequently confirmed this trend experimentally. This work demonstrates the opportunity that MOFs offer as tunable materials for catalyst design and how computational methods can be used to guide experimental efforts in finding active catalysts for light alkane oxidation and other challenging reactions.
Computational Methods
All DFT calculations were performed using the software package Gaussian 16 Rev. A.03. (53) All calculations were spin-unrestricted and used the M06-L functional due to its moderate computational cost for catalyst screening studies. M06-L is recommended for transition metals and inorganic and organometallic systems, (54) has shown good performance in reproducing experimental trends for hydrocarbon adsorption on Fe-MOF-74 (55) and ethylene dimerization on Co- and Ni-decorated NU-1000 nodes, (56) and has been used for similar studies of alkane partial oxidation in MOFs. (12,16,17,57) M06-L has also shown good agreement with functionals such as B3LYP-D3, PBE-D3, and M06 for computationally derived reactivity trends toward propane ODH on NU-1000-supported heterobimetallic clusters. (57) The choice of spin states for each of the species in the catalytic reactions and a comparison of spin state energy splitting with other hybrid and local functionals are discussed in Section S3 of the Supporting Information. The def2-SVP basis set was used for H, C, N, and O and the def2-TZVP basis set was used for the first-row transition metals. (58,59)
The Cu site in Fe2Cu tended to acquire a square planar geometry in the steps following C–H activation, causing the structure of the cluster to be significantly different from the rest of the clusters and incompatible with being part of an extended MOF structure. For this reason, we froze the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the formate groups of the clusters containing copper. The rest of the clusters were fully optimized.
Vibrational frequencies were calculated from the optimized geometries to confirm the nature of the intermediates and transition states in the catalytic reaction. The vibrational frequencies were also used to calculate the molecular partition functions, from which thermal and entropic contributions to free energies were calculated at 523.15 K. We employed the quasi-harmonic oscillator approximation, (60) by replacing all frequencies below 50 cm–1 with 50 cm–1 when computing vibrational free energies to reduce errors associated with the breakdown of the harmonic oscillator approximation for very low-frequency normal modes. (61,62) The rotational and translational partition functions were set equal to one for the cluster species to describe the solid-state nature of the cluster as a part of the crystal structure. Additional computational details can be found in Section S1 of the Supporting Information.
Materials Synthesis
Synthesis of PCN-250 (Fe3O)2(C16H6N2O8)3
A solution of N′,N dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetic acid (AA) 600 mL (DMF/AA 2:1 by vol) was heated to 120 °C. To this solution, (E)-5,5′-(diazene-1,2-diyl)diisophthalic acid (2.8 g, 7.8 mmol) was added and dissolved by sonication. To this solution, iron nitrate nonahydrate (7 g, 17.3 mmol) was added, and the mixture was further sonicated to dissolve the iron nitrate nonahydrate. The solution was placed in a preheated oven at 140 °C for 24 h. The solution was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The solution was filtered to yield an orange solid. PCN-250 (the resulting powder) was solvent-exchanged with DMF (3 × 100 mL) and MeOH (6 × 100 mL) over a 3 day period. Vacuum activation at 200 °C yielded activated PCN-250.
Synthesis of Metal Cluster Fe2M(C2H3O2)6 (M = Ni, Co, and Mn)
Sodium acetate trihydrate (210 g, 1.54 mol) was added to water (350 mL) and stirred at room temperature. To this solution, iron nitrate nonahydrate (40.4 g, 0.1 mol) and metal nitrate (0.1 mol) were added. After 24 h, the precipitate was filtered off, washed with cold water (500 mL), then ethanol (500 mL), and dried at room temperature for 24 h. (Mn: manganese nitrate tetrahydrate (25.1 g), Co: cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (29.1 g), Ni: nickel nitrate hexahydrate (29.8 g))
Synthesis of PCN-250(Fe2M) (Fe2MO)2(C16H6N2O8)3 (M = Ni, Co, Mn)
A solution of N′,N dimethylformamide and acetic acid 600 mL (DMF/AA 2:1 by vol) was heated to 120 °C. To this solution,(E)-5,5′-(diazene-1,2-diyl)diisophthalic acid (2 g, 5.6 mmol) was added and dissolved by sonication. To this solution, the presynthesized metal cluster (2 g) was added, and the mixture was further sonicated to dissolve the metal cluster. The solution was placed in a preheated oven at 140 °C for 24 h. The solution was removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The solution was filtered to yield an orange solid. PCN-250(Fe2M) was solvent-exchanged with DMF (3 × 100 mL) and MeOH (6 × 100 mL) over a 3 day period. Vacuum activation at 200 °C yielded activated PCN-250(Fe2M).
Material Characterization
Characterization results are shown in Figure S33 of the Supporting Information. All reagents and solvents unless otherwise stated were obtained from commercial sources (Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich) and were used without further purification. The 1.5 mm glass capillary tubes used to load powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) samples were purchased from Hampton Research.
PXRD experiments were conducted at the Jerome B. Cohen X-ray Diffraction Facility located at Northwestern University using the 18 kW Rigaku ATX-G Thin-film Diffraction Workstation. The samples were analyzed over a two theta range of 3–30° and with a scan rate of 8°/min (Figure S33).
All N2 gas adsorption and desorption measurements, unless stated otherwise, were performed on a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 system (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA) at 77 K. Between 75 and 200 mg of samples were employed in each measurement. The specific surface areas for N2 were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) model in the range of 0.005 < P/P0 < 0.05. DFT pore size distributions were calculated from the desorption part of the isotherms. A carbon slit pore model with a N2 kernel was employed to describe the pore geometry.
Reaction Methods
Cyclohexane ODH reaction studies were carried out in a plug-flow quartz tube reactor at 523 K over PCN-250(Fe2M). To maintain differential conversion (conversion less than 10% of cyclohexane), 100–200 mg of the catalyst was used. For N2O activation, the system was heated to 523 K with a ramp rate of 5.0 K/min and kept at 523 K for 8 h under flowing N2O (5 mL/min, 1%, Airgas). For reaction with the reactant, in addition to the same N2O flow at the same temperature, cyclohexane (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced by He (5 mL/min, 99.999%, Airgas) through a saturator with a total pressure of 1.4 bar at 298 K (0.13 bar of reactant). Flow rates of reactant and oxidant were controlled by mass flow controllers (Altamira Instruments). Online product identification and quantification were performed by a 7890 A GC (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Hydrocarbons were separated by DB-Wax column (Agilent, 30 m length, 0.32 mm diameter, and 0.25 μm film) and then detected by a FID. Any other species were separated by a combination of HP-Plot/Q column (Agilent, 30 m length, 0.53 mm diameter, and 40 μm film) and HP-Molsieve column (Agilent, 15 m length, 0.53 mm diameter, and 50 μm film) and then detected by a TCD. The catalysis and online product analysis were performed in the REACT core facility at Northwestern University.

Figure 5. (a) Preference of oxygen to bind to the Fe or M site, represented by the difference between the binding free energies of oxygen on the M site (ΔGM═O) and on the Fe site (ΔGFe═O). A negative value corresponds to a favorable binding to the M site and a positive value corresponds to a favorable binding on the Fe site. (b) Correlation between the oxygen-binding energy and the N2O activation barrier (blue) and the C–H activation barrier (red). We calculate the N2O activation barrier from 1 to TS1 and the C–H activation barrier from 2 to TS2. The squares and circles correspond to the reaction occurring on the Fe site and M site of the cluster, respectively. All calculated energies are free energies at 250 °C. Figure S29 shows the correlations with energies calculated as electronic energies with zero-point energy corrections and the N2O activation and C–H activation barriers calculated from 1_N2O to TS1 and from 2_C3H8 to TS2, respectively.
