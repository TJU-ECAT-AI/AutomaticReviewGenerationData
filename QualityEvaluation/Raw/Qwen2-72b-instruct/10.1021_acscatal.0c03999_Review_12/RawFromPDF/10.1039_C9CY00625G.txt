Catalytic halogenation of methane: a dream reaction with 
practical scope? 
Vladimir Paunovid* and Javier Pérez-Ramírez* 
Development of catalysts that could surpass the activity and selectivity constraints of the non-catalytic radical-mediated 
halogenation of methane constitutes a long-standing challenge, which holds great potential to valorise this readily 
available resource for the production of commodities. This study presents comprehensive performance maps of a large 
library of materials, comprising carriers (quartz, SiO2, SiC, -Al2O3, -Al2O3, carbon), noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru), metal oxides 
(Fe2O3, CeO2), chlorides (PdCl2, CuCl2) and oxyflourides (TaOF3) supported over SiO2, -Al2O3, carbon or H-ZSM-5 carriers, 
sulfated systems (S-ZrO2, S-ZrO2-SBA-15, S-TiO2, S-Nb2O5, S-Ta2O5, Nafion) and zeolites (3A, H-USY, H-MOR, H-SAPO-34, 
H-BETA, H-ZSM-5) in chlorination and bromination of methane under practically relevant conditions and gains insights into 
the nature of the catalytic effects as a function of the catalyst and halogen of choice. Chlorination activity of different 
catalyst beds at low temperatures (473-523 K) was 2-5.5 higher compared to the void reactor of identical volume, while 
the bromination rate was almost unaffected by the solids in the whole temperature range (643-723 K). Except for zeolites 
and Pt/carbon, which promoted polyhalogenation, selectivities to halomethane over most of catalysts were similar to 
those in the non-catalytic reactions and were higher in bromination (SCH3Br = 80-95% verusus SCH3Cl = 52-90% at 
XCH4 = 5-18%). The formation of carbon oxides (SCOx = 2-28%) over several materials in chlorination and virtually all systems 
in bromination implied the decomposition of halomethanes, which at higher temperatures led to cooking, particularly in 
the latter reaction. The kinetic fingerprints along with the marginal impact of Si:Al ratio, counter ions and extraframework 
aluminium species on the performance of the most active H-ZSM-5 catalyst indicated that methane chlorination over 
various materials is governed by the radical-chain mechanism, which limits the scope for breaking the 
selectivity-conversion relationships by tailoring the catalyst acidity. Nonetheless, the enhancement of chlorination activity 
over zeolites that followed a volcano-like dependence on their micropore size coupled with a more significant impact of 
the intracrystalline mesopororsity and crystallite size on the product distribution revealed the important role of 
confinement effects in this reaction, which may pave the way for the advancements in the production of chloromethanes. 
Introduction 
The reactions of methane with molecular halogens (X2, X = F, 
Cl, Br or I, eqns (1-4)) constitute the earliest known routes to 
functionalize this astonishingly inert hydrocarbon, the history 
of which dates back to 1840 when the French chemist Jean 
Baptist Dumas reported the conversion of marsh gas by the 
action of chlorine (Fig 1).1,2 The extensive kinetic studies of 
these thermally or photo-activated halogenation processes 
performed between the 1910s and the 1940s led to the 
postulation of the radical-chain mechanism that was verified 
for all halogens and paraffins (Fig 1).3-11 The halogen radicals 
(X•) initially formed via homolytic bond dissociation of X2 and 
regenerated through the reaction of alkyl radicals with X2, play 
a central role in this reaction network. The differences in 
stability between the X•, which increases in the order 
F• < Cl• < Br• < I•, cause that methane fluorination is extremely 
exothermic and often explosive, chlorination and bromination 
display medium and mild exothermicity, respectively, and 
moderate activity, while the iodination is endothermic and 
equilibrium limited (eqns (1-4)).1 The differences in radicals’ 
reactivity induce substantial variations in the product 
distribution as a function of halogen, since the mono- (CH3X), 
di- (CH2X2) and threehalomethanes (CHX3) could react in 
analogue fashion as methane leading to polyhalogenation. In 
contrast to fluorinations which inevitably lead to a complete 
substitution, chlorination could provide a high selectivity to 
monohalomethanes 
if 
operated 
at 
a 
relatively 
high 
methane-to-chlorine 
ratio 
(typically 
molar 
CH4:Cl2 >10), 
although CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 are formed in significant amounts at 
close to stoichiometric feed composition.12,13 In contrast, 
methane bromination yields a high selectivity to CH3Br (>90%) 
at smaller methane excess (CH4:Cl2 >5), while polybromination 
is generally limited to the formation of CH2Br2.1

The industrial interest for methane halogenation already 
ignited in the early 20st century, when following a series of 
patents, the first industrial process based on non-catalytic 
thermal chlorination of methane was established in 1923 by 
Hoechst.2 After incorporating several refinements during its 
life-span, this remains the state-of-the-art technology for the 
manufacture of chloromethanes (mostly CH2Cl2 and CHCl3), the 
world-wide production of which is estimated to exceed 1.4 Mt 
year-1, with a market size of ca. 1,000 M$ (Fig 1).2 Although the 
latter chemicals are mostly used as solvents and precursors in 
synthesis of polymers and fine chemicals, as early as in the 
1920s CH3Cl was recognized as an attractive intermediate to 
produce methanol and ethers by reacting it with oxides such 
as CaO.14 This concept was advanced in the 1980s, when 
George A. Olah proposed a disruptive halogen-mediated route 
to valorise methane, the main constituent of highly abundant 
and inexpensive natural gas, by mitigating the costly and 
energy-intensive syngas-based processes.15 The concept is 
based on a selective C-H bond activation using Cl2 or Br2 to 
yield CH3X, which are versatile platform molecules that can be 
readily coupled into value-added chemicals and liquid fuels via 
catalytic pathways that are similar to those of methanol 
(Fig 1).15–19 The implementation of this technology is 
contingent on the full recycling of hydrogen halide (HX) 
formed in the halogenation and coupling steps, the ability to 
maximize the productivity of CH3X over polyhalomethanes and 
its coupling efficiency.1,20 The recent decade testified 
significant progress in HX recovery via cataloreactants 
systems,21-22 
electrochemical 
and 
thermochemical 
HX 
oxidation,23-26 and methane oxyhalogenation,26-28 as well as 
CH3X coupling,16-19 which brought this technology closer than 
ever to practical implementation. In contrast, the selective 
monohalogenation was tackled to a much less depth.

One approach to enhance the selectivity to CH3X is based 
on the use of a substantial methane excess in the non-catalytic 
halogenation, which, however results in a large CH4 recycle 
stream.1,12,13 Alternatively, the polyhalomethanes can be 
reformed 
by 
reproportionation 
with 
another 
alkane 
(eqn (5)),28-30 or hydrodehalogenation (eqn (6)).31 Still, the key 
to selective monohalogenation relies on mitigating the radical 
steps via an alternative reaction pathway that is facilitated by 
the catalyst. Although the early reports on halogenation 
describe the enhancement of reaction rate in the presence of 
different “inert” solids (e.g., silica and active carbons) as well 
as the CuCl2-based melts and fluidized beds,11,32 the 
fundamental landmark to this goal was set by Olah, who 
devised the concept of electrophilic C-H bond activation 
enabled through the polarization of the X2 molecule by the 
action of super-acid catalysts (Fig 1).15,33 This pathway displays 
an inherent propensity to CH3X as the addition of strongly 
electron withdrawing halogen substituents destabilizes the 
intermediate carbonium ion complex and hinders further 
substitution. The proof of concept was demonstrated using 
homogeneous SbF5 catalyst, but aiming to achieve more 
practical space-time yields, Olah et al. studied supported noble 
metals as well as solid-acid catalysts based on oxyflourides 
(Fig 1).15,33 The former systems were found active at low 
temperatures (≤543 K), providing unprecedented selectivity to 
CH3Cl (80-99%) and CH3Br (99%) even when a substantial 
excess of halogen was applied. The same group also reported 
the catalytic effect of sulfated zirconia and several zeolites in 
methane chlorination.13,34 The high selectivity to CH3Cl (99%) 
can be obtained over mordenite using a molar ratio of 
CH4:Cl2 ≥4 at >623 K, while lower temperatures and small 
methane excess favour the radical pathways and consequent 
polyhalogenation. Nevertheless, the zeolite catalysts displayed 
a fast deactivation that was associated with excessive 
dealumination. The interest in selective halogenations has 
been rekindled in the early 2000s as a response to a shale gas 
surge. In addition to their work on non-catalytic bromination 
and 
CH2Br2 
reforming 
via 
reproportionation 
and 
hydrodebromination,29,31 the groups of McFarland and Metiu 
described sulfated Nb2O5 and ZrO2 as selective bromination 
catalysts (≤95% CH3Br),21 while Degirmenci et al.35 reported 
high CH3Br selectivity (>99%) over sulfated ZrO2 included in 
SBA-15 structures (S-ZrO2-SBA-15) at large bromine excess. Joo 
et al.36 showed that methane chlorination over H-Y, Pt/H-Y and 
Pt/Na-Y leads to a slightly higher activity compared to the 
non-catalytic reaction, although the selectivity patterns remain 
almost unaffected. Batamack et al.37 reported the one-pot 
conversion of methane to valuable hydrocarbons by 
integrating methane halogenation and CH3X coupling over 
SAPO-34 catalyst achieved using a high CH4:X2 molar ratio of 
ca. 10. 
In spite of these encouraging results, the previous reports 
were typically limited to the reaction of one halogen (i.e., Cl2 
or Br2) and few catalytic systems, which were investigated 
under very different regimes, precluding thus to assess the 
catalytic over non-catalytic effects and to derive the 
generalized performance trends as a function of catalyst family 
and type of halogen, which are essential for the catalyst 
development. Besides, the stability of halomethanes over 
different materials and propensity of the latter towards coking 
or reactions with halogen under corrosive halogenation 
environment were rarely discussed.  
Herein, aiming to set the basis that will revitalize the 
research in this field, we conducted the first comprehensive 
evaluation of a large library of catalytic materials comprising 
inorganic and carbon carriers, supported noble metals, metal 
oxides, chlorides and oxyflourides, as well as sulfated systems 
and zeolites in both methane chlorination and bromination 
under identical reaction conditions and provided the general 
overview on their potential to promote these reactions. In 
addition, the impact of the framework structure and topology 
on the performance of zeolite catalysts in methane 
chlorination was investigated, which along with the kinetics 
analysis uncovered the significant role of confinement effects 
on C-H bond activation with chlorine.

Quartz (Thommen-Furler, ≈99%), SiO2 (Evonik, AEROPERL 
300/30, ≥99.0%), SiC (Alfa Aesar, ≥98.8%), -Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 
99.98%) and -Al2O3 (Sasol, PURALOX SCFa 140, ≥98%) were 
calcined prior to their use as catalyst carriers or in the catalytic 
tests. Activated carbon (CABOT NORIT RX 1.5 EXTRA, ≈100%) 
was applied as received. 
Supported metal-based catalysts 
Pt/Al2O3 (Aldrich, 5 wt% Pt) was purchased commercially and 
reduced just prior the catalytic tests in flowing H2 (20 mol% in 
He, gas hourly space velocity, GHSV = 680 h-1) at 623 K for 2 h 
(5 K min-1). Pt/SiO2 (1 wt% Pt), Ru/SiO2 (1 wt% Ru), Pd/SiO2

the pore volume of the carrier in appropriate amounts to 
achieve the desired loading of the active phase. The precursor 
solution was gradually added to the support and the wet solid

impregnation using previously reported protocols.15,38 In brief, 
Pt/carbon catalyst was synthesized by dropwise addition of 
0.025 M H2PtCl6·6H2O (ABCR, 99.9%) solution in aqua regia to 
the carbon support (2.5 cm3 g-1
carbon) during 30 min under 
continuous stirring. The material was dried at ambient 
pressure and 333 K, and then thermally treated in flowing N2 
(GHSV = 10,000 h-1) at 673 K for 5 h (5 K min-1). TaOF3/Al2O3 
was prepared by gradually dissolving TaF5 (ABCR, 99%) in cold 
(195 K) methanol (Acros, 99.8%) followed by the addition of 
the resulting solution (0.48 M) to -Al2O3 (2.0 cm3 g-1
Al2O3). 
Thereafter, the material was calcined at 523 K (1.5 K min-1). 
Sulfated oxides 
S-ZrO2 (Alfa Aesar, 2-4% active SO3) and Nafion (Aldrich, 
SAC-13, 10-20% Nafion on SiO2) were purchased commercially. 
S-TiO2 was synthesized by stirring TiO2 (Aldrich, nanopowder, 
99.5%) in 1 M H2SO4 (Aldrich, 99.999%) aqueous solution 
(30 cm3 g-1
TiO2) for 30 min. The solid was recovered by 
filtration, dried and finally calcined at 773 K (2 K min-1). S-Ta2O5 
and S-Nb2O5 were prepared by adjusting a previously reported 
protocol.21 Herein, H2SO4 was added to Ta2O5 (Acros, 99.99%) 
or Nb2O5 (Aldrich, 99.9%) powder (1.7 molH2SO4 mol-1
oxide) and 
the mixture was stirred for 30 min, dried and calcined using 
the same procedure as described for S-TiO2. S-Zr-SBA-15 was 
obtained as reported by Degirmenci et al.35 In brief, tetraethyl 
orthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich, ≥99%) and ZrOCl2·8H2O (Fluka, 
≥99%) were added (0.3 molZrOCl2 mol-1
TEOS) to a solution of 
Pluronic P123 polymer (Aldrich, Mn = 5800) in 1.6 M HCl 
(Acros, 
37%) 
aqueous 
solution 
(0.027 gpolymer cm-3, 
0.058 gTEOS cm-3) and stirred at 313 K for 24 h. The mixture was 
transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 373 K 
for 12 h under static conditions. The solid was recovered by 
filtration, washed with deionized water, dried and calcined at 
773 K for 5 h. Finally, the material was stirred with 0.5 M H2SO4 
aqueous solution (100 cm3 g-1
Zr-SBA-15) for 1 h, separated by 
filtration, 
dried 
and 
calcined 
at 
573 K. 
S-Nb2O5-SiO2 
(20 wt% Nb2O5) was synthesized by wet impregnation. A 
0.28 M solution of NH4Nb(C2O4)3·nH2O (Aldrich, 99.99%) in 
1 M H2C2O4 (Acros, 98%) was added to a SiO2 carrier 
(6.7 cm3 g-1
SiO2), followed by drying and calcination at 773 K. 
The obtained material was finally sulfated using the same 
protocol as detailed for S-Nb2O5 catalyst.

respective codes, were calcined prior to their use in the 
catalytic tests or as precursors in the further modification of a 
parent material. The zeolites containing ammonium ion were 
thus transformed in protonic (H) form. 
Li-ZSM-5-25, Na-ZSM-5-25, Cs-ZSM-5-25, Ca-ZSM-5-25 and 
Fe-ZSM-25 were prepared by triple ion exchange of H-ZSM-25

LiNO3 (FLUKA, 98%), NaNO3 (Acros, ≥99%), CsNO3 (Acros, 
99.99%), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) and FeCl2·4H2O 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) at room temperature (100 cm3 g-1
zeolyte) 
for 12 h, followed by drying and calcination. Pt-ZSM-5-25 was 
obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of H-ZSM-5-25 
material with a solution of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2·nH2O (1 wt% Pt) using 
the analogues procedure detailed for supported metal 
catalysts. Mg-ZSM-5-140 (2 wt% MgO) was prepared following 
the recipe of Liu et al.18 Herein, 0.16 M solution of 
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 
99%) 
was 
mixed 
with 
H-ZSM-5-140 zeolite for 2 h (3.2 cm3 g-1
zeolite). The suspension 
was dehydrated at 353 K for 4 h, dried and calcined at 723 K 
for 8 h. 
H-ZSM-25-ox was prepared by refluxing the parent 
H-ZSM-5-25 sample with 1 M H2C2O4 aqueous solution 
(50 cm3 g-1
zeolyte) for 13 h. Thereafter, the material was 
recovered by filtration, washed with deionized water, dried 
and calcined. H-ZSM-5-25-st was derived by steaming 
(100 mol% H2O) the parent H-ZSM-5-25 material in fluidized 
bed reactor (GHSV = 5350 h-1) for 12 h. H-ZSM-5-40-at zeolite 
was prepared using the well-established alkaline treatment 
protocol.39 In brief, the parent H-ZSM-5-40 zeolite was 
exposed to a 0.2 M NaOH (Acros, 98.5%) aqueous solution 
(3.75 cm3 g-1
zeolyte) and the resulting suspension was stirred at 
338 K for 30 min in a Mettler Toledo Easymax 102 reactor 
system. The treatment was quenched by diluting the mixture 
with a twentyfold excess of deionized water, followed by solid 
separation by filtration and its washing until neutral pH. The 
material was ion exchanged three times with 0.1 M NH4NO3 
(Acros, 99%) aqueous solution (100 cm3 g-1
zeolyte) at 338 K for 
12 h, 
and 
finally 
dried 
and 
calcined. 
Nanocrystalline 
H-ZSM-5-40-nc zeolite was synthesized according to the 
procedure of Van Grieken et al.40 Aluminium isopropoxide

Catalyst characterization 
The structure of the crystalline materials was confirmed by 
X-ray diffraction analysis performed at PANalytical X′Pert PRO-
MPD diffractometer with Bragg−Brentano geometry using 
CuKα radiation ( = 1.54060 Å). The presence of the sulfate 
groups in sulfated oxides was evidenced by Diffuse-reflectance 
infrared Fourier-transformed spectroscopy (DRIFTS) performed 
using Bruker Optics Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with a 
high-temperature DRIFT cell (Harrick) and an MCT detector. N2 
isotherms of selected catalysts were recorded at 77 K using 
Micromeritics TriStar II analyzer. Samples (ca. 0.15 g) were 
evacuated to 50 kPa at 573 K for 12 h prior to the 
measurement.  
 
Catalyst testing 
Chlorination and bromination of methane as well as the 
reactions of CH2Cl2 and CH2Br2 with different solids were 
performed at ambient pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed 
reactor setup described in Fig 2. Gases, CH4 (PanGas, purity 
5.0), Cl2 (PanGas, purity 2.8), O2 (PanGas, purity 5.0), 
Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0) and He (PanGas, purity 5.0) were fed by 
a set of digital mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst). Br2 was 
supplied by passing CH4 flow through a bubbler containing 
liquid Br2 (ABCR, 99%) and placed in a water bath, the 
temperature of which was maintained at 3020.5 K. Water, 
CH2Cl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and CH2Br2 (ABCR, 99%) were 
supplied by a syringe pump (Nexus 6000, Chemyx). The 
catalyst (catalyst volume, Vcat = 2.7 or 15 cm3, particle size, 
dp = 0.4-0.6 mm) was loaded in the central wide section of the 
glass 
reactor 
(characteristic 
dimensions, 
dr = 10.5 mm, 
dt = 4 mm, 
hr = 55 mm and 
hc = 5.5 
or 
dr = 18.5 mm, 
dt = 4.8 mm, 
hr = 80 mm and 
hc = 10.2 mm, 
Fig 2 inset) 
between the two plugs of quartz wool. The reactor was heated 
by home-build electric oven. The temperature was controlled 
by a thermocouple inserted in a glass thermowell (outside 
diameter, dtw = 3 mm), which was positioned along the vertical 
reactor axis with its tip aligned with the bottom of the bed, 
while the pressure was monitored by the pressure sensor 
installed prior to the reactor. The thermowell and the bed 
composed of glass beads were used to additionally reduce the 
volume of the narrow top and bottom reactor sections, 
respectively. The aluminium foil shielding the reactor, as well 
as the opaque tubbing, connections and valves were used to 
preclude the contact of light with the reaction mixtures and 
hence photo-induced halogenation. The gas lines used to feed 
Br2, water, CH2Cl2 and CH2Br2, as well as the downstream lining 
were maintained at 393 K to prevent the condensation of 
these reactants and reaction products such as CH2Cl2, CH2Br2 
and CHCl3. 
Prior to testing, the solids were heated to 723 K for 2 h in 
flowing He (GHSV = 13700 h-1) to eliminate the traces of 
moisture, O2 and other possible gas impurities. The only 
exceptions were PdCl2/SiO2, CuCl2/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3 and 
Nafion catalysts, which were treated at 573 K to avoid their 
potential thermal decomposition or volatilization. Thereafter, 
the bed was cooled down to desired temperature and left to 
stabilize for at least 30 min before the catalytic test. Unless 
stated otherwise, the reactant mixture comprising CH4:Cl2 in a 
molar ratio of 8.5:3.5 was fed at GHSV = 267 h-1 or 50 h-1 in 
methane chlorination and the mixture containing CH4:Br2 in a 
molar ratio of 8.5:3.2±0.1 was introduced at GHSV = 260 h-1 or 
48.5 h-1 in methane bromination. The reactor effluent was 
diluted with He-Ar mixture (He:Ar = 71.5:4.5) and directed 
towards analysis section. Carbon-containing compounds (CH4, 
CH3Br, CH2Br2, CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CO and CO2) and Ar were 
quantified on-line via a gas chromatograph equipped with a 
GS-Carbon PLOT column coupled to a mass spectrometer 
(GC-MS, Agilent GC 6890, Agilent MSD 5973N). Quantification 
of Cl2 and Br2 at the reactor outlet was performed by their 
absorption in an impinging bottle filled with 0.1 M KI aqueous 
solution (X2 + 3I- → I3
- + 2X-) followed by iodometric titration 
(Mettler Toledo G20 Compact Titrator) of the formed triiodide 
(I3

Results and discussion 
Catalyst performance in methane halogenation 
The preliminary insights into the catalytic effects in methane 
halogenation were acquired by analysing both the chlorination 
and bromination performances of Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, S-ZrO2 
and H-SAPO-34 (Fig 3), which are the main representatives of 
the previously reported catalyst families (Fig 1).13,15,34,37 The 
activity and selectivity profiles of the materials were recorded 
by using the undiluted reactant mixtures comprising methane 
and halogen in a molar ratio of CH4:X2 = 3.5 in the chlorination 
and CH4:X2 = 3.2±0.1 in the bromination reaction. Moderate 
methane excess simulates the practically relevant operating 
regime, which strives at full halogen consumption that 
facilitates 
the 
downstream 
product 
separation 
while 
minimizing the size of the hydrocarbon recycle. Moreover, the 
selected ratios were smaller than those at which free-radical 
halogenations display an inherently high selectivity to CH3X, 
enabling thus the resolution of the catalytic from the 
non-catalytic 
effects.15,34 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
latter 
problematics, the catalyst activities were compared at 
constant GHSV and constant temperature (GHSV = 267 h-1 and 
T = 523 K in methane chlorination, GHSV = 260 h-1 and 
T = 643 K in methane bromination) and benchmarked to the 
activity patterns of the empty glass reactor and reactor 
accommodating the bed of quartz particles, whereby the 
values of the latter two reaction parameters are consistent 
with 
the 
typical 
conditions 
applied 
in 
the 
previous 
studies.13,15,34,35,37 This approach, which was practiced in the 
work of Olah at al.,13,15,34 enables the decoupling of the 
catalytic from the non-catalytic gas-phase contributions, since 
the volume of the interparticle voids does not differ 
significantly between the different catalyst beds. Besides, it 
also has a practical relevance as it shows the level of 
productivity enhancement of a given reactor in the presence of

catalysts compared to the inherent activity of its void volume 
or bed composed of inert particles. 
 
The assessment of both methane and halogen conversion 
in methane chlorination at 523 K indicated that the bed of 
quartz particles displays an almost identical performance as an 
empty reactor of the same volume (Fig 3a). Considering the 
fact that the effective void volume of the bed is ca. 2 times 
smaller than that of the empty reactor (bed porosity,  ≈ 0.4),43 
this result suggests that chlorination reaction is promoted 
even in the presence of inert and low-surface area solids. The 
conversion of methane and Cl2 over Pt/SiO2, TaOF3/Al2O3, 
S-ZrO2 and H-SAPO-34 catalysts was ca. 2-2.5 higher compared 
to quartz, suggesting the further activity promotion over these 
solids. The onset of methane bromination was shifted to 
ca. 120 K higher temperature with respect to chlorination. The 
activity of quartz particles was comparable to that of an empty 
reactor, but in contrast to chlorination, methane conversion in 
bromination was almost unaffected by the catalytic materials. 
Still, the conversion of bromine was higher over the catalysts, 
especially H-SAPO-34, which can be associated with a more 
pronounced polybromination, oxidation and reactions with a 
catalyst (vide infra). 
In addition to the conversion profiles, the differences in the 
selectivity to CH3X were evaluated as another indicator of the 
potential catalytic effects (Fig 3b). In general, the operation 
under comparable CH4:X2 molar ratios and GHSVs led to a 
higher fraction of CH3X in bromination compared to 
chlorination 
(SCH3Br = 80-95% 
verusus 
SCH3Cl = 52-90% 
at 
XCH4 = 5-18%). Besides, the selectivity to CH3X declined less 
steeply upon increasing the methane conversion in the former 
reaction, corroborating the higher inherent propensity to 
selective 
monohalogenation 
in 
the 
former 
reaction. 
Nevertheless, the selectivity to CH3X in both reactions 
decreased 
in 
the 
similar 
order, 
empty reactor ≈ quartz ≈ Pt/SiO2 > TaOF3/Al2O3 ≈ S-ZrO2 > 
H-SAPO-34, indicating the prominent impact of the catalyst on 
the product distribution. 
 
In order to generalize the performance trends, the analysis 
was extended to a significantly broader range of the materials 
which can be classified into four distinct groups, supports, 
metal-based materials, sulphated oxides and zeolites. Aiming 
to provide the comprehensive overview of their catalytic 
behaviours and the facile benchmarking of the activity and 
selectivity patterns of the materials with respect to the void 
reactors, supports as well as other families and their individual 
members, the circular plots are devised as presented in 
Figs 4 and 5. These are composed of the top semicircle, which 
provides the information of the catalyst activity and the 
bottom semicircle, which outlines the product distribution 
patterns. The semicircles are further divided into four circular 
sectors, a-d (top) and e-f (bottom), which present the 
performances of the materials within a specific family. The 
activity sectors provide the information on the halogen and 
methane conversion at constant temperature and GHSV, 
which both increase in the direction from the circle centre. The 
bottom sectors present the selectivities to CH3X, CH2X2, CHX3 
and COx as a function of methane conversion, which increases 
in clockwise direction, and indicate the formation of coke 
deposits. The red- and dark-coloured background areas of the 
subsections denote the performance regions of empty reactors 
and inorganic carriers, respectively, serving thus as the 
reference for the evaluation of the catalytic contributions. 
 
The conversion levels attained over various inorganic 
supports, i.e., SiO2, SiC,-Al2O3 and -Al2O3 are similar to or 
higher than that of the empty reactor, even when its volume 
exceeds the volume of the carrier bed by a factor of 5.5 (Fig 4, 
sector a), corroborating thus the beneficial effect of solids on 
the 
low-temperature 
methane 
chlorination. 
Thereby, 
mesoporous SiO2 and -Al2O3 carriers displayed ca. 2 times 
higher conversion of reactants as compared to their 
nonporous counterparts, quartz, SiC and -Al2O3, suggesting 
the positive impact of the surface area on methane 
chlorination. Nonetheless, the selectivity profiles of the former 
carriers testified the lower fraction of CH3Cl as compared to 
those of the latter group, which exhibited similar product 
distribution pattern as the empty reactor (Fig 4, sector e). 
Notably, while CH2Cl2 and to a small extent CHCl3 constituted 
the only byproducts over quartz, SiO2 and SiC, the evolution of 
COx along with CH2Cl2 was very prominent over alumina 
supports. Given the oxygen-free inlet feed and the absence of 
reaction between methane and -Al2O3 and -Al2O3 in the 
temperature range of interest, the formation of COx could only 
arise from the decomposition of chloromethanes over these 
carriers (vide infra, Fig 7b).44 Another peculiar behaviour was 
observed for the carbon support, which although exhibiting 
ca. 1.5-2 times higher methane conversion than SiO2 and 
-Al2O3 and a selectivity profile that closely matched that of 
quartz and the empty reactor, lead to an immense Cl2 
conversion. 
The 
latter 
significantly 
exceeded 
the 
stoichiometric level calculated on the basis of chloromethanes 
production (ca. 30%) as well as the Cl2 conversion levels 
achieved over the materials displaying similar methane 
consumption (e.g., H-ZSM-5-40, vide infra), indicating that the 
part of Cl2 might react with the carbon support. This 
hypothesis was verified by exposing the carbon carrier to a 
pure chlorine stream which was fed at similar temperature and 
GHSV as those applied in chlorination, whereby the halogen 
uptake of ca. 50% was measured. 
 
The recorded performance profiles of various carriers 
define the benchmark regions (denoted as darker-coloured 
areas in Fig 4) which enabled to decouple the potential 
catalytic contributions of the supported metal-based active 
phases. Specifically, the conversion of methane over all 
studied systems was of similar magnitude as compared to the 
respective carriers (Fig 4, sector b). Pt/carbon, CuCl2/SiO2 and 
Fe2O3/SiO2 displayed a higher chlorine conversion, which can 
be associated with the carrier halogenation for the first (vide 
supra)   and   active   phase   chlorination   for   the   latter   two

catalysts. In addition, CuCl2/SiO2 and Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst 
exhibited the formation of deposits on the reactor walls and 
glass-beads located bellow the catalyst bed, which are 
indicative of the volatilization of the metal-halide species. The 
product distribution patterns of most of metal, metal halide 
and metal oxide catalysts paralled those of the respective 
supports and empty reactors, with PdCl2/SiO2 and Fe2O3/SiO2 
exhibiting the highest selectivity to CH3Cl (Fig 4, sector f). The 
most prominent deviations from these trends were displayed 
by Pt/carbon and TaOF3/Al2O3, which favoured COx production, 
while 
the 
first 
system 
also 
displayed 
a 
marked 
polyhalogenation activity.  
 
The conversion levels of methane and Cl2 over sulfated 
catalysts were comparable to those of SiO2 and -Al2O3, with 
S-TiO2 displaying the highest activity (Fig 4, sector c), while the 
selectivity to CH3Cl for most of these systems followed the 
almost identical patterns as those recorded over quartz and in 
an empty reactor (Fig 4, sector g). More peculiar deviations 
from the general selectivity trends were displayed by S-ZrO2 
and S-Nb2O5 catalysts. Specifically, in the case of S-ZrO2, CH3Cl 
was the only chlorinated product at low-to-moderate methane 
conversions (≤11%). However, this behaviour was linked with 
high selectivity to COx (SCOx = 2-27%, mostly CO), likely 
produced through the decomposition  of polychlorinated 
products (vide infra, Fig 7b). The evolution of COx was also 
pronounced over S-Zr-SBA-15 catalyst. In turn, S-Nb2O5 
provided the highest selectivity to CH3Cl, which was ca. 2% 
higher than that of the empty reactor. Its supporting on SiO2 
did not enhance the activity, while the CH3Cl selectivity curve 
was shifted to a slightly lower values that are still above those 
of SiO2. Nevertheless, a small fraction of COx (SCOx = 2%) was 
also formed over the supported system. 
 
More significant performance differences with respect to 
the previously discussed catalyst families were observed when 
the chlorination reaction was performed over zeolites. In 
particular, while the methane and Cl2 conversions achieved 
over zeolite 3A, H-USY-8, H-MOR-15 and H-SAPO-34 fall in the 
similar range as those of SiO2 and -Al2O3 supports, H-BETA-15 
and H-ZSM-5-40 provided ca. 2-2.5 times higher conversion 
levels, enabling thus up to 5.5 times higher activity with 
respect to the benchmark quartz and empty reactor systems. 
Another peculiar feature of zeolites is related to the increased 
fraction of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 with respect to CH3Cl. In addition, 
similar to the alumina carriers, all zeolite catalysts except 
H-ZSM-5-40 favoured the production of COx. This was 
especially pronounced for H-SAPO-34, which was also the only 
system leading to coke deposition at 573 K, as inferred both 
from more significant deviations of the carbon balance and 
visual inspection of the used catalysts. The evaluation of 
H-ZSM-5-40 catalyst in a 10 h test using CH4:X2 ratio of 8.5:3.5 
and GHSW = 267 h-1 at 573 K indicated no performance 
deterioration, whereby the X-ray diffraction pattern and 
N2-isotherm of the used catalyst do not show significant 
variations with respect to the fresh material. 
 
In analogy to methane chlorination, the performance 
analysis was further extended to additional supports and 
catalytic systems in methane bromination (Fig 5). The 
conversions of methane and Br2 over porous SiO2 support were 
ca. 2 times higher as compared to quartz, but still comparable 
to those of the empty reactor of identical volume. This 
suggests that the external surface has a smaller impact on the 
bromination activity, which appears to be primarily governed 
by the available void volume. This is also corroborated by the 
significantly higher conversion increase upon expanding the 
void reactor volume as compared to methane chlorination. In 
view of product distribution, SiO2 carrier displayed a similar 
behaviour as quartz and empty reactor in the low temperature 
regime. However, a prominent drop in selectivity to CH3Br 
(ca. 15%) coupled with the evolution of small amounts of COx 
and coking occurred at higher temperatures (ca. 723 K), 
suggesting the interaction of brominated products with SiO2 
carrier. The fraction of COx as well as the propensity to coke 
were particularly high for the carbon support, which also 
displayed a marked bromine conversion in analogy to its 
behaviour in methane chlorination. 
Compared to the empty reactor and inorganic carriers, 
supported metal-based catalysts (Fig 5, sector b) and sulfated 
oxides (Fig 5, sector c) generally led to the comparable 
conversion levels, while their selectivity patterns were 
characterized by lower fraction of CH3Br coupled with 
pronounced COx production. The exceptions to these trends 
were Pt/SiO2 and to some extent S-ZrO2-SBA-15, whose 
selectivity curves did not deteriorate substantially from the 
benchmark systems. Similar to methane chlorination, the 
volatilization of Fe2O3/SiO2 was also observed. In the case of 
sulfated oxides, SO2 was detected in the outlet feed, indicating 
their limited stability under bromination environment. In 
addition, coke deposits were formed on S-ZrO2 at 723 K. 
Zeolite catalysts with the exception of H-MOR yielded slightly 
higher conversions of methane (ca. 1-2%) compared to SiO2. 
However, the product pool of all zeolite catalysts was 
negatively affected by the increased fraction of COx as well as 
coking, which was prominent at temperatures ≥723 K. 
 
Impact of zeolite structure on methane chlorination 
The noticeable activity promotion of H-ZSM-5-40 catalyst with 
respect to the empty reactor and various inorganic carriers in 
methane 
chlorination 
coupled 
with 
the 
considerable 
compositional and modification flexibility of the MFI 
framework, makes this catalytic system highly suitable to study 
the structure-performance relationships that could cast the 
light on the origins of its catalytic action (Fig 6). In this respect, 
the activity of H-ZSM-5 materials was first analysed as a 
function of their Si:Al ratio, which is the central parameter 
controlling the acid properties and polarity of zeolites (Fig 6, 
sectors a and e).45 The conversion of reactants was slightly 
lower over H-ZSM-5-15 as compared to the other H-ZSM-5 
catalysts. Nonetheless, the overall variations in activity and 
product distribution were of limited extent in the broad range 
of Si:Al ratios (15-1000), which along with the similar 
behaviour of TS1-25 catalyst implies a weak correlation 
between the zeolite performance and the concentration and 
strength of  Brønsted  acidic sites. In addition, the  introduction

of various cations in the ZSM-5-25 framework had almost no 
influence on the activity and selectivity patterns (Fig 6, sectors 
b and f). The only exception to the latter trend were 
Li-ZSM-5-25 and Na-ZSM-5-25, which led to a more significant 
conversion enhancement compared to the benchmark 
H-ZSM-5-40 and H-ZSM-5-25. This result might be the sign of 
the additional catalytic effect that could arise from the strong 
Lewis acidic (electrophilic) character of the relatively small and 
solvent-free Li+ and Na+ cations that has been found beneficial 
for the chlorination of aromatic compounds.46 Nevertheless, 
the selectivity-conversion profile of both of these catalysts did 
not deflect significantly from those recorded over other ZSM-5 
systems, except that similar to the Cs-ZSM-5-25 it led to a 
slightly lower fraction of CH3Cl compared to CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 
(Fig 6, sector f). Consistent with the above observations, the 
treatments of H-ZSM-5-40 catalyst with steam or oxalic acid, 
which cause the formation of extraframework aluminium 
species, 
loss 
of 
acidity 
and 
moderate 
increase 
in 
mesoporosity,47,48 did not affect the performance (Fig 6, 
sectors c and g). Still, the alkaline-assisted desilication of this 
zeolite, which introduces a more significant fraction of the 
intracrystalline mesopores that are also more accessible from 
the outside surface,39 led to a slight increase in the fraction of 
monochlorinated over polychlorinated products at essentially 
unaltered activity. Similar change in selectivity profile at 
almost unaltered activity was observed for the H-SnBETA-220 
(prepared by the alkaline-assisted stannation) with respect to 
the reference H-BETA-15 catalyst (Fig 6, sectors c and g). Given 
the weak sensitivity of the chlorination reaction on the nature 
and strength of acid sites, the shift in selectivity pattern 
observed in the samples with more developed mesoporosity 
can be associated with a decrease in the characteristic length 
of the microporous domains that could reduce the extent of 
polyhalogenation by facilitating the escape of CH3Cl. This 
hypothesis is further corroborated by the behaviour of 
H-ZSM-5-40-ns comprising the crystals of smaller size with 
respect the H-ZSM-5-40, which also induced a slight decrease 
in the fraction of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 with respect to CH3Cl (Fig 6, 
sector g).  
 
In addition to the variations in the framework structure, 
the impact of the reaction conditions on the chlorination 
performance of ZSM-5 zeolites was investigated (Fig 6, sectors 
d and h). In particular, the impact of water co-feeding was 
evaluated as it was previously devised as a strategy to boost 
the selectivity to CH3Cl 
and minimize cooking over 
H-SAPO-34.37 In fact, the addition of water to the chlorination 
feed decreased the fraction of CH2Cl2 and almost eliminated 
the formation of CHCl3 at virtually unaltered conversion levels. 
Nevertheless, it provoked a significant COx (mostly CO) 
evolution, indicating the preferential hydrolysis of the 
polychlorinated products, which was considered before. This 
result also corroborates that the evolution of the COx that was 
observed over other zeolite frameworks in chlorination and 
was especially pronounced in bromination stems from the 
interaction of halomethanes with bridging oxygen sites, which 
could be replenished by water. Finally, the CH4:Cl2 ratio was 
increased to explore the scope for the enhancement of 
selectivity to CH3Cl. Notably, the operation under tenfold 
methane excess caused only a small increase in selectivity to 
CH3Cl (ca. 6%) with respect to the use of the reference CH4:Cl2 
ratio of 8.5:3.5 (Fig 6, sectors d and h). Comparatively, the use 
of 10-fold methane excess in the case of SiO2 lead to ca. 15% 
increase in selectivity with respect to the above stated 
reference feed.  
 
Mechanistic insights in methane halogenation over solid 
surfaces 
The evaluation of a large number of materials in methane 
halogenations 
revealed 
their 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
chlorination activity, but limited effect on the bromination rate 
as compared to the respective non-catalysed reactions 
(Figs 3-5). Nonetheless, metal-based and sulfated catalysts 
displayed similar conversion levels as the supports in methane 
chlorination, while their CH3Cl selectivity profiles were 
comparable to those achieved in the empty reactor and over 
the bare carriers. Notably, the variations of the Si:Al ratio and 
counter cation as well as the formation of the extraframework 
aluminium species, which are expected to alter the polar 
intermediates and transition states had almost no effect on 
the performance over the most active ZSM-5 zeolite. These 
results provide strong indication that the radical-chain 
mechanism dominates in the overall process, since the 
alternative activation pathways would induce more significant 
deviations in activity and selectivity patterns. To further 
support these findings, the apparent kinetic fingerprints of 
methane chlorination acquired over H-ZSM-5-40 catalyst were 
compared to those recorded over SiO2 (Fig 7a). The apparent 
activation energy of the zeolite catalyst was ca. 20 kJ mol-1 
lower as compared to SiO2, in agreement with the observed 
activity enhancement. Still, the apparent reaction orders with 
respect to methane and Cl2 have very similar values for the 
two materials, suggesting the similarity in the mechanism of 
reactants 
activation. 
Additional 
experimental 
evidence 
supporting the involvement of radical intermediates in the 
chlorination over zeolite catalysts stems from a prominent 
decrease of the chlorination rate over both H-ZSM-5-40 and 
upon the addition of O2, which is a well-known inhibitor of the 
radical processes.3,6,11 Moreover, the O2 inhibition constants 
over both materials are essentially identical (ca. -0.6), whereby 
their absolute value closely matches the apparent reaction 
order measured with respect to Cl2. This is constituent with 
the mechanism of O2 inhibition involving its reaction with 
methyl radicals, which hampers the regeneration of chlorine 
radicals from Cl2 and hence the chain propagation (Fig 1).6 
The promotional effect of the solid surfaces in the catalytic 
chlorination may stem from evolution of the methyl radicals, 
as postulated in other methane functionalization processes 
such as oxidative coupling.49 Nonetheless, considering the 
significantly 
lower 
temperature 
window 
of 
methane 
chlorination (<623 K) with respect to the oxidative coupling 
(>873 K), the surface-mediated formation of methyl radicals is 
expected to be less favored in the former reaction. This is 
corroborated by the negligible rate of methane oxidation over

the most active H-ZSM-5 catalyst. Hence, the higher rates of 
methane chlorination over solid catalysts are likely associated 
with the enhancement of the chlorine dissociation by the 
surfaces, which has the major contribution to the overall 
reaction 
barrier 
in 
this 
reaction 
particularly 
at 
low 
temperatures (Fig 8a).1,29 Namely, this unimolecular reaction 
necessitates the interaction with the second molecular entity, 
referred to as mediator (M), which excites the halogen 
molecule.50 In this context, one part of the promotional effect 
could come from the non-specific chlorine-surface collisions, 
generally known as “wall effects”.11,50 In addition, theoretical 
studies pointed out that Cl2 interaction with the defect sites on 
metal and metal-oxide surfaces (Fig 8a, inset) may lead to the 
transfer of the electron density to the antibonding orbitals of 
the adsorbate.51,52 This weakens the Cl-Cl bond and might 
induce practically barrierless dissociation of Cl2 into atomic Cl•. 
The dominant impact of the solid surfaces on the chlorine 
dissociation step is also corroborated by the observation that 
the rate difference between methane chlorination over the 
solids and methane chlorination in the empty reactor 
diminishes at higher reaction temperatures, since the latter 
reaction parameter increases the effectiveness of Cl2-M 
collisions and shifts the equilibrium towards dissociation, 
yielding thus sufficiently high concentration of the Cl• radicals 
that can initiate the reaction.  
The radical nature of halogenation reactions over zeolite 
catalysts raises the question about the origin of activity 
enhancement over the H-ZSM-5 and BETA materials with

Fig 8. a) Rate determining steps involved in non-catalytic free-radical methane chlorination (left) and bromination (bromination) at low 
and high temperatures, along with the proposed impact of the catalysts on their energy barriers. The energy profiles of the initiation and 
C-H activation in non-catalytic processes are taken from the literature.29,56 The insets depict the interaction of halogens with a mediator

respect to the other zeolites as well as other catalytic systems. 
The results discussed so far suggest that these are not 
correlated with their electronic, but rather geometric 
properties. The latter could impact on the confinement of the 
reactants, radical intermediates or transition states, facilitating 
thus the reaction. In fact, in addition to their acidity, the ability 
of zeolites to stabilize the reactive intermediates and 
transition states by the action of the dispersive van der Waals 
interactions within the well-defined system of micropores, 
generally referred as shape selectivity, represents another 
important aspect of their catalytic action, particularly in the 
reactions involving hydrocarbons.53. Notably, if the activities of 
various zeolites attained in the low-temperature regime are 
plotted against their characteristic pore openings,54 a 
volcano-like dependence is obtained, which exhibits a 
maximum for the micropore diameters of 0.56-0.6 nm (Fig 8b). 
Strikingly, the later micropore size range is comparable to the 
sum of the kinetic diameters of methane (0.38 nm) and 
chlorine radical (0.16 nm),55 which are the intermediates 
participating in the second step that has smaller contribution 
to the overall reaction barrier (Fig 8a). These results indicate 
that although the chlorination of methane over zeolite 
catalysts preserves its radical character, the appropriate size of 
BETA and particularly ZSM-5 structures enables the optimal 
confinement of the reactive species, enabling thus a higher 
activity (Fig 8b). 
The above reasoning might also explain the lack of 
significant promoting effect of the catalysts in methane 
bromination. Owing to weaker Br-Br and C-Br bonds as 
compared to the respective Cl-Cl and C-Cl bonds, the major 
part of the activation barrier in bromination is determined by 
the C-H bond scission with Br• radical (Fig 8a).29 This leads to a 
higher reaction temperature of methane bromination as 
compared to chlorination, at which the concentration of Br• 
radicals is high enough to initiate the reaction, so that the 
promoting effect of the surface on the generation of these 
species becomes practically irrelevant. As the barrier for CH4 
activation is not substantially affected by the solid, the 
catalytic and non-catalytic reactions display a comparable rate. 
Another peculiar aspect of the catalytic halogenation 
relates to the formation of COx, which was not discussed in the 
previous studies in this field. As shown by the experiments in 
which CH2X2 was taken as a model halogenated product and 
fed over the representative catalysts and carriers under 
conditions 
comparable 
to 
those 
applied 
in 
methane 
halogenation (Fig 7b,c), the formation of COx primarily 
originates from the interaction of the halomethanes with the 
active oxygen sites of supports. In particular, the rate of 
carbon oxides evolution was high over S-ZrO2 for both CH2X2 
and CH2Br2 and was generally higher for CH2Br2, consistent 
with 
the 
selectivity 
patterns 
observed 
in 
methane 
halogenations (Figs 4 and 5). 
In general, our results provide the strong hints that 
radical-pathways play the major role in methane halogenation 
over solid surfaces. In this regard, they are coherent with our 
previous studies on methane oxyhalogenation, which showed

Conclusions 
The evaluation of a large number of materials comprising 
supports, noble metals, halides, oxyhalides, and oxides 
supported over different carriers, sulfated oxides and zeolites 
in methane halogenations revealed their positive impact on 
the chlorination activity, but limited effect on the bromination 
rate as compared to the respective non-catalysed reactions. 
Particularly high conversion levels in methane chlorination 
were attained over the beds of ZSM-5 and BETA zeolites, 
displaying ≥5 times higher productivity than the void reactor of 
equivalent volume. Still, the fraction of CH3X over most of 
studied catalysts was similar to that achieved in the void 
reactor or over the bare carriers and was generally higher in 
methane bromination than in methane chlorination. The major 
deviations from these trends were displayed by Pt/carbon and 
zeolite catalysts in methane chlorination, and BETA and ZSM-5 
in 
bromination, 
which 
favoured 
polyhalogenation. 
Nonetheless, the formation of halomethanes over alumina 
carriers and alumina-supported catalysts, sulfated oxides, 
Pt/carbon and most of zeolites in methane chlorination and 
virtually all catalytic systems in methane bromination was 
negatively affected by the evolution of COx. In addition, higher 
operating temperatures led to coke deposition over multiple 
catalysts in methane bromination as well H-SAPO-34 in 
methane chlorination, while carbon support displayed 
substantial halogen uptake in both reactions. These side 
processes stemming from the interaction of halomethanes and 
halogens with catalysts were typically not considered in the 
previous studies, which in turn could bring to the false 
conclusions on the catalytic performances. The variations of 
the Si:Al ratio and counter cation as well as the formation of 
the extraframework aluminium had almost no effect on the 
activity and selectivity patterns in methane chlorination over 
the most active ZSM-5 zeolite, which along with significant 
kinetic similarity between this material and SiO2 as well as 
pronounced O2 inhibition effect indicates that the reaction 
primarily proceeds via non-polar radical-chain mechanism. The 
promotion of activity is likely caused by the confinement of the 
radical intermediates and/or transition states, which is 
strongly supported by the volcano-like dependence of the 
chlorination activity on the size of zeolite micropores. Thereby, 
the maximum is achieved for the ZSM-5 channels the diameter 
of which corresponds to the sum of kinetic diameters of 
methane and chlorine radical. In overall, our results suggest 
that the radical mechanism prevails in the halogenation over a 
broad range of catalysts, limiting thus the scope for improving 
the selectivity to CH3X. Nonetheless, marked enhancement of 
the chlorination activity over ZSM-5 and BETA catalysts along 
with increased fraction of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 might hold an 
interesting potential for the advancements in the production 
of these important chemicals.
