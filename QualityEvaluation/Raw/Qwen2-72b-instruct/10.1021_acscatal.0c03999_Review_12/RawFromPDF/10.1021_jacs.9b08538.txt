Abstract
Aromatization of light alkanes is of great interest because this can expand the raw materials used to produce aromatics to include fractions of natural gas that are readily available and inexpensive. Combining CO2 reduction with ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization can also mitigate CO2 emissions. A one-step process that can produce liquid aromatics from the reactions of CO2 and ethane using phosphorus (P)- and gallium (Ga)-modified ZSM-5 has been evaluated at 873 K and atmospheric pressure. The addition of P improves the hydrothermal stability of Ga/ZSM-5, reduces coke formation on the catalyst surface, and allows the formation of more liquid aromatics through the tandem reactions of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and subsequent aromatization. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the effect of Ga- and P- modification on ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene as well as the role of CO2 on the production of aromatics.

Introduction
Identifying effective chemistries that reduce CO2 while simultaneously producing valuable chemicals remains a challenge. (1−3) Utilizing light alkanes as a CO2 reduction agent is a promising route in which abundant and underutilized reactants can produce valuable olefins or synthesis gas via the CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) or dry reforming reactions, respectively. (4−6) While both the CO2-ODH and reforming reactions of alkanes produce value-added molecules, the separation of gas phase products is challenging and requires additional processes. It is therefore highly desirable to develop a tandem reaction scheme in which the reaction of CO2 and alkanes can produce liquid products. Aromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylene) are important liquid petrochemical intermediates produced via naphtha reforming, a process in which the feedstock constitutes 60–70% of the total manufacturing costs. (7,8) Expanding the library of raw materials used to produce aromatics is of significant interest, especially if using an abundant fraction of shale gas such as ethane. Literature suggests that one of the limiting steps in ethane aromatization is the production of the olefin. Our previous work focused on the production of olefins from the CO2-ODH of C2, (9−11) C3, (12) and C4 (13) with CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts under operating conditions applicable to aromatization. Combining CO2 reduction with the tandem reactions of ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization can produce valuable liquid products while consuming a greenhouse gas in a one-step process.
Typical direct dehydrogenation and aromatization (DDA) catalysts suffer from deactivation due to high carbon deposition rates, but in the proposed tandem CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization (CO2-ODA) reaction, CO2 can consume the coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO), thus enhancing stability. Also, CO2 can promote the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), consuming H2 and thereby enhancing dehydrogenation activity. To account for the effect of CO2 via the RWGS reaction, thermodynamic calculations evaluating both the DDA and CO2-ODA of ethane were performed. Figure 1 illustrates the equilibrium reactant conversions and product distributions as a function of temperature in the presence and absence of CO2. The DDA reaction pathway occurs via direct dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and subsequent aromatization of ethylene to benzene with an initial feed of Ar/C2 of 1:1, while the CO2-ODA pathway includes the simultaneous occurrence of the RWGS reaction with an initial feed of CO2/C2 of 1:1. Figure 1a illustrates that the CO2-ODA pathway can achieve higher ethane equilibrium conversions at lower reaction temperatures, with up to 30% C2 conversion below 700 K. The addition of CO2 as a coreactant can help overcome the thermodynamic limitations of the DDA reaction by consuming H2 formed during dehydrogenation and aromatization, shifting the reaction equilibrium toward the products, as shown in Figure 1b–d. Furthermore, the positive effect of CO2 on both the C2 equilibrium conversion and benzene mol % is also observed with increasing CO2/C2 ratios as shown in Supporting Information Figure 1.

DDA was evaluated by direct dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and subsequent aromatization of ethylene to benzene with an initial feed of Ar/C2 of 1:1, while CO2-ODA included the simultaneous occurrence of the RWGS reaction with an initial feed of CO2/C2 of 1:1. Calculations were performed with the assistance of HSC Chemistry Outotec software v8.
The DDA of light alkanes typically occurs over pentasil-type zeolites (ZSM-5) due to their unique micropores and acidic properties, see Supporting Information note 1. (8) Ethane is the second-largest component in shale gas, but unlike propane and butane, it intrinsically shows lower activity for ethane conversion and production of aromatics over unmodified ZSM-5 for the DDA reaction. (14) Literature suggests that rate of ethane activation by protons is very low, in contrast to higher alkanes that can be activated by protons effectively leading to high conversions over ZSM-5 (≥57%). (15−17) The difference in activity between ethane and higher alkanes (i.e., propane) for DDA reactions over ZSM-5 can be attributed to the ease at which the interaction between propane and proton can form a secondary carbenium ion, whereas the interaction with ethane leads to only the primary carbenium ion. Thus, with ethane, the protolytic cleavage of a C–H bond is 30 times faster than the C–C bond scission despite the involvement of unstable primary carbenium ions. Modification of ZSM-5 with metal cations, such as Zn and Ga, can increase the alkane conversion and selectivity to aromatics for the DDA reaction. (15,16) For short chain hydrocarbons such as ethane, the Lewis acid sites provided by the metal is critical for ethane activation. (18,19) Typically, the involvement of Brønsted acid sites in alkane activation decreases as the number of carbons in the alkane decreases. Thus, the role of exchanged metals in the ZSM-5 framework have been reported to be the primary active sites for dehydrogenation and aid in the combinative desorption of H2 from the surface. (20) Oligomerization and cyclization are then catalyzed by acid sites, and the aromatics selectivity is influenced by the acid strength. Incorporation of Ga in ZSM-5 has been reported to influence the strength of the acid sites on the zeolite, facilitate the H2/ethylene desorption, and lower the activation energy for C–H bond scission. (20) Therefore, to increase ethane activation on ZSM-5, Ga was chosen as the metal modifier in the current study and used to compare the activity of the DDA and CO2-ODA reactions.
There are at least two key challenges to overcome for achieving CO2-promoted aromatization of ethane: (1) the catalyst must activate both CO2 and the alkane and (2) the catalyst should exhibit long-term stability in the presence of water that is produced from the reactions of CO2. Although there are several studies in the literature illustrating that the presence of CO2 promoted the dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization of ethane using zeolite catalysts, the results were obtained during very short reaction times, typically no more than 0.5 h. (21,22) The modification of ZSM-5 with phosphorus (P) has the potential to increase hydrothermal stability, tune the acid–base properties, and decrease coke formation. To date, P-modification has been applied to methanol-to-olefins, (23) propylene to ethylene, (24) as well as olefin and C5+ cracking (25) chemistries but, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored for the CO2-ODA reactions. In this study, we explore the P-modification of Ga/ZSM-5 to enhance both the long-term stability and the aromatics yield for the CO2-assisted tandem reactions of dehydrogenation and aromatization of ethane.
Results
Synthesis and Characterization Using XRD and XANES
All catalysts were synthesized with proton-exchanged ZSM-5 containing a Si/Al molar ratio of 30 (sourced from Riogen Catalysis for Chemicals and Energy). Phosphorus modification, ZSM-5/P(X), was achieved via a slurry technique that was mixed at 313 K for 12 h. The calculated mixture of ethanol, water, and 85 wt % H3PO4 was sonicated for 10 min before combining with a paste of ZSM-5 (created with 20 mL of water). Calcination followed a program at 823 K for 6 h (5 K/min ramp). Incorporation of 2 wt % Ga to ZSM-5 was achieved via incipient wetness impregnation with Ga(NO3)3 salt (Sigma-Aldrich) onto ZSM-5 or ZSM-5/P(X) followed by calcination at 563 K for 2 h (with a 0.8 K/min ramp rate). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) data (Supporting Information Figure 2) was obtained on the 17-BM beamline (λ = 0.24162 Å) at Advanced Photon Sources (APS) with a detector distance of 800 mm. The sample was loaded into capillary tubing (Polyimide, Cole-Parmer, model 95820-90), followed by plugging the ends with clay to avoid air exposure. The fitting results are tabulated in Supporting Information Tables 1 and 2, additional experimental information is provided in Supporting Information note 2, and crystal structures are shown in Supporting Information Figure 3.
The XRD patterns of the ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5, and Ga/ZSM-5/P catalysts indicated that doping with low concentrations of P and Ga did not alter the overall XRD profiles. It should be noted that, even after catalytic reactions, the spent samples still maintained the ZSM-5 structures without the phase transition to another class of crystalline porous materials such as aluminophosphate (AlPO) and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO).
The oxidation state of Ga was characterized using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements of Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P for fresh samples and under reaction conditions. These results are included in Supporting Information Figure 4. At the fresh stage, both samples showed a white line at 10377 eV (denoted as peak B) corresponding to the trivalent Ga (Ga3+). Under reaction conditions, Ga was partially reduced, leading to a split into two peaks at 10372 eV (denoted as peak A) and 10377 eV. The observation of the 10372 eV peak was indicative of monovalent Ga (Ga1+), consistent with the previous report by Bell et al. (26) Under reaction conditions, peaks A (Ga+) and B (Ga3+) were observed in both Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P samples, suggesting that the presence of P did not significantly modify the electronic state of Ga.

aShown for activity in the presence and absence of CO2 (3 and 0 mL/min, respectively) performed with a total flow rate 10 mL/min at 873 K with Ar diluent (4 and 7 mL/min, respectively), 300 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh). Values are obtained by averaging the data from hours 9–10 on stream. Selectivity and yield are on a C2H6 basis (including carbonaceous species only). For catalyst-containing modifiers, the Ga and phosphorous loadings are 2 wt % and 0.8 wt %, respectively, and the Si/Al molar ratio for all catalysts is 30.
CO2-ODA and DDA Activity over ZSM-5 and Ga-Modified ZSM-5
Under DDA reaction conditions, the unmodified ZSM-5 catalyst initially exhibited C2 conversion of roughly 7%, but after 10 h on stream, the activity decreased to less than 2% with 26.7% liquid aromatic selectivity. The activity profile was similar in the presence of CO2, except for the formation of CO, altering the selectivity profile to be 24.9% toward liquid aromatics and 5.6% toward CO. When ZSM-5 was modified with 2 wt % Ga via an incipient wetness technique, the conversion increased roughly by a factor of 10 (17.1% C2 conversion) with increased selectivity to liquids (42.6%) and enhanced stability. In the presence of CO2 neither the C2 conversion nor the selectivity toward liquids was enhanced compared to the DDA reaction over Ga/ZSM-5. However, the formation of water and CO provided direct evidence of CO2 activation, resulting in CO2 conversion of 10.2%. The selectivity toward liquid aromatics was similar to that without CO2 (41.8% vs 42.6%), but the formation of methane with CO2 was almost a factor of 2 higher than that in the absence of CO2. In addition, the conversion profile following time on stream (TOS) indicated that the reaction with CO2 was slightly less stable. As observed, the introduction of CO2 in the feed altered the dehydrogenation pathway in a mildly oxidative manner by consuming H2, consequently producing water. Studies have shown that zeolite catalysts are highly sensitive to the presence of water under reaction conditions. Thus, to improve zeolite tolerance to water and allow the benefits of cofeeding CO2 to enhance performance, it was of interest to examine a series of P-modified Ga/ZSM-5/P(X) catalysts.
CO2-ODA Activity over P-Modified Ga/ZSM-5/P(X) Catalysts
To determine an optimal loading, a series of catalysts were modified with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 wt % P and evaluated for the CO2-ODA reaction. The values are listed in Table 1. Overall, the addition of P positively influenced the yield toward liquid aromatics (Figure 2a), improved stability (Figure 2b), and decreased the production of methane (Supporting Information Figure 8). The stability of the catalysts was assessed by normalizing the reactant conversion by the value corresponding to 2 h on stream. The reported values of stability in Figure 2b were the average of hours 9–10 on stream. Positive effects on the liquid aromatic yields were observed with the addition of 0.2 wt % P, but the stability was not enhanced until a loading of 0.4 wt % P. The CO2 and C2 conversions continued to increase with similar selectivity profiles until a P loading of 0.8 wt % (shown in Supporting Information Figure 9). Increasing the loading to 1.6 wt % negatively impacted CO2 and C2 conversion to values (6.4 and 9.8%, respectively) below those of the unmodified Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst. Improved stability was still observed for the 1.6 wt % catalyst, but this effect may also be attributed to the low yield of aromatic products. Thus, the 0.8 wt % P-modified Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst had the highest yield of liquid aromatics with improved stability compared to the unmodified Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst for the CO2-ODA reaction. The effect of P on stability for the Ga/ZSM-5 catalytic system was also confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown and described in Supporting Information note 3 and Supporting Information Figure 10.

The stability of the catalysts is assessed by normalizing the reactant conversion by the value corresponding to 2 h on stream. The reported values of stability are the average of hours 9–10 on stream.
CO2-ODA and DDA Activity Comparison between Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8)
The observed improvement with P-modified catalysts was evaluated using the CO2-ODA reaction, but it was also of interest to evaluate the activity of the highest performing P-modified catalyst, Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8), for the DDA reaction. The effect of CO2 for the unmodified and 0.8 wt % P-modified Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts is shown in Figure 3. Unlike the unmodified Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst, the Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst showed an improvement in liquid aromatic selectivity (55.5%) in the presence of CO2, resulting in a higher yield. Therefore, the incorporation of P at an optimal loading allows for the formation of more liquid aromatics through the CO2-ODA reaction compared to the DDA reaction, with considerable CO2 consumption and slightly increased ethane turnover per mol of Ga metal (19.9 vs 21.0, mol reactant·mol Ga–1·h–1 respectively).

Kinetic Studies over Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8)
Further understanding of the promising CO2-ODA Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst was obtained through kinetic measurements, which were performed under slightly different reaction conditions to allow lower conversions to minimize the effects of heat and mass transport. The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 530–660 K (corresponding Arrhenius-type plots shown in Supporting Information Figure 11). The activation barrier to produce liquid aromatics from ethane was measured as 121 kJ·mol–1; similarly, the barrier for the production of ethylene was 124 kJ·mol–1. The apparent activation barrier for CO2 activation, 163 kJ·mol–1, was much greater than for the transformation of ethane to ethylene and aromatics. In a previous CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation study performed over readily reducible CeO2 support (no aromatic production), CO2 was activated by the support and interfacial sites between the supported bimetallic system (Fe3Ni) and CeO2, resulting in a CO2 activation barrier of 115 kJ·mol–1. In the present study, the choice of ZSM-5 is critical for the production of aromatics, but this support likely cannot facilitate CO2 activation. Therefore, effective sites (i.e., Ga) capable of CO2 activation are essential for the CO2-ODA reaction over ZSM-5-based catalysts.
The influence of the reactant vol % on the production of aromatics and CO2 activation was examined by gradually increasing one reactant while maintaining the other constant (30 vol %). The total flow rate remained the same by varying the Ar diluent accordingly. Figure 4a shows that as the vol % of CO2 increased the rate of aromatic formation decreased linearly. Supporting Information Figure 12a also shows that CO2 had a negative effect on the production of ethylene. However, the effective transformation of CO2 to CO, Figure 4b, was positively influenced until a CO2/C2 ratio of 1.7, after which the rate also began to decline. Increasing the ethane vol % in the feed had a positive effect on ethylene production and a minimal effect on both the liquid aromatic and CO production until a C2/CO2 feed ratio of 1.7. These trends are indicative of competitive adsorption of reactants, suggesting that one type of active site is capable of activating both CO2 and C2H6 for subsequent reactions.

CO2-ODA Reaction Performed with 13CO2 Isotope
Isotope experiments with 13CO2 were performed over Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) to determine the origin of carbon in the aromatic products. The catalyst underwent normal activation in Ar before the introduction of reaction gases, beginning with 12CO2 and C2H6. The reaction was held on stream for 54 min before collecting 4 data sets of m/z values 1 to 100. The gas was then switched from 12CO2 to 13CO2 and was allowed to stabilize for 14 min before collecting another four data sets (collected during TOS 100–130 min). The formation of benzene was tracked with m/z values of 72–78, the range of possible fragments if 12CO2 or 13CO2 was involved in the formation of benzene, as shown in Supporting Information Figure 13. The intensity of 72–78 m/z peaks did not alter with the isotope switch, indicating that aromatics are solely formed via the C2H6 molecule. On the other hand, Supporting Information Figure 14 shows that m/z values of 44 and 45 (CO2) as well as 28 and 29 (CO) changed in intensity corresponding to the isotope switch.
Reaction Pathways and DFT Calculations
Dehydrogenation Activity over ZSM-5 and Ga-Modified ZSM-5
DFT calculations were performed to gain insight into the possible reaction mechanisms of direct ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene (DDE) over ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5, with a focus on identifying the intrinsic role of Ga. The active site structures of ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 employed in DFT calculations are illustrated in Supporting Information Figure 15(a) and 15(b), respectively. Both structures include two Al substitutions with Si at framework positions T12 and T2. For Ga/ZSM-5, the active site is composed of a Brønsted–Lewis acid site pair, similar to the work of Schreiber et al. for propane dehydrogenation. (27)
The mechanisms of ethylene formation from the DDE over ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 are illustrated in Supporting Information Figure 16, and the corresponding energy diagrams are shown in Supporting Information Figure 17. Over ZSM-5, ethane dehydrogenation to an ethoxide (C2H5O) species was catalyzed by a Brønsted acid site and was uphill in energy with a considerable activation barrier of 2.48 eV. Accompanying the formation of the ethoxide species (C2H5O) was the formation of H2 molecules inside the ZSM-5 pore. The subsequent dehydrogenation of C2H5O to form C2H4 and the simultaneous regeneration of the Brønsted acid site was facile, with a barrier of 0.62 eV.
Two distinct mechanisms were examined for the DDE reaction over Ga/ZSM-5, with the first pathway being via a Brønsted acid site and the second via a Brønsted–Lewis acid pair site. The dehydrogenation mechanism via the interaction of the Brønsted acid site was similar to the pathway observed over unmodified ZSM-5, where ethane dehydrogenation to C2H5O was rate limiting with a high barrier of 2.94 eV. In this mechanism, the Ga+ species bound above the O–Al–O bridge site did not participate in the catalytic process, and therefore the addition of Ga did not result in an increase in activity because the barrier for ethane activation to ethoxide with Ga increases by 0.46 eV. Catalytic conversion of light alkanes to olefins via a Ga/ZSM-5 Lewis acid site is unlikely due to insurmountable energy barriers, (27,28) indicating that the Ga+ species itself is not sufficient to catalyze ethane dehydrogenation. While Lewis acid sites cannot catalyze reactions, there is a synergistic effect when the Lewis acid site pairs with a Brønsted acid site, creating a Brønsted–Lewis acid site pair. For instance, the Brønsted acid site can transfer the H to the Ga+ site to form a (GaH)2+ species. On the basis of the literature, (27) the Ga in (GaH)2+ is in the Ga3+ oxidation state which should possess Lewis acid strength higher than that of the Ga+ state, as evidenced by the increased charge on Ga from 0.5 to 1.0 (Löwdin charge). In the environment of (GaH)2+, H becomes a hydride that is negatively charged. This proton transfer process was calculated to be 0.53 eV endothermic, indicating that the original Brønsted–Lewis acid site model with a Ga+ species is the lowest energy state of Ga/ZMS-5. Once the [GaH]2+ species was generated, ethane dehydrogenation was facilitated and proceeded much faster (barrier of 0.60 eV). Consequently, the rate of H2 formation was also increased (barrier of 0.65 eV).
Thus, for the addition of Ga to promote ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, the reaction mechanism should occur via cooperative Brønsted–Lewis acid sites and not just via Brønsted acid sites alone. The Brønsted–Lewis acid site is bifunctional in nature. The Brønsted acid site protonated the Ga+ to form a (GaH)2+ active species, which then, together with the basic framework oxygen, heterolytically activated one of the C–H bonds of ethane with a low barrier. A C2H5Ga intermediate was produced and further dehydrogenated to C2H4, completing the regeneration of the Brønsted–Lewis acid pair site. The second dehydrogenation step was rate limiting, with a barrier of 1.56 eV. Compared to unmodified ZSM-5, the DFT-calculated activation barrier of ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene over Ga/ZSM-5 was reduced from 2.48 to 1.87 eV. Overall, the increased ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 compared to unmodified ZSM-5 in flow reactor experiments can be attributed to the synergistic catalysis induced by the a Brønsted–Lewis acid sites. The [GaH]2+ species was reported as the active site for alkane dehydrogenation reactions from both experimental and theoretical studies in the literature. (27,29−31)
Role of CO2 in the Dehydrogenation and Aromatization of Ethane over Ga/ZSM-5
The flow reactor results in this study illustrate that in the presence of CO2 neither the C2 conversion nor the selectivity toward aromatics is enhanced over Ga/ZSM-5 after 10 h on stream. The incorporation of P significantly increases the yield to aromatics and improves the stability, indicating that CO2 is assisting the tandem reactions of ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization. DFT calculations were performed to gain insight into the intrinsic role of CO2 in ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene coupled with ethylene transformation to benzene. In these calculations, benzene was used as the model aromatic molecule because it was the dominate liquid product in the flow reactor results.
Four possible mechanisms for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene over Ga/ZSM-5 in the presence of CO2 were examined. By calculating the minimum energy pathways, the most energetically favorable mechanism required that ethane be first dehydrogenated to C2H5Ga and H2 over the Brønsted–Lewis acid sites. Then, CO2 reacted with the produced H2 to form CO and H2O via RWGS and the C2H5Ga further dehydrogenated to C2H4, regenerating the a Brønsted–Lewis acid pair site. The energy diagram of this mechanism is shown in Figure 5 while other examined pathways are provided in Supporting Information Figure 18. Comparing the energetics between Supporting Information Figure 17c and Figure 5 illustrated that the rate of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 was anticipated to be lower compared to the reaction in the absence of CO2 over Ga/ZSM-5. This was partially attributed to high barriers for CO2 hydrogenation to CO and H2O, indicating that CO2 was not capable of consuming H2 at an appreciable rate to adequately shift the equilibrium toward the production of olefin over Ga/ZSM-5. Despite the low rates of CO2 hydrogenation, the amount of H2O that was produced had the potential to influence the reaction mechanism because DFT calculations showed that H2O molecules adsorbed strongly on the Ga+ site, with a binding energy of 1.65 eV. Due to the interaction of H2O with the active site, dehydrogenation of the formed C2H5Ga to C2H4 needed to surmount a higher barrier compared to the case without CO2 (2.12 vs 1.56 eV). Therefore, the ethane dehydrogenation activity was not promoted by CO2 cofeeding on Ga/ZSM-5, consistent with the experimental observation. Literature has shown that in the presence of steam (over 678 K), the Si–O–Al framework gradually hydrolyzes and Al is expelled. A zeolite that is susceptible to dealumination inherently exhibits lower hydrothermal stability and activity under reaction conditions that produce water. Previous studies have demonstrated that P-modification can improve the hydrothermal stability and resistance to coke formation on ZSM-5 catalysts; (32,33) this will be further described in detail in a later section.

These two figures demonstrate that the H2 formation steps are substantially uphill in reaction energy and may be the slow steps in ethylene aromatization to benzene over Ga/ZSM-5. The introduction of CO2 to the feed may facilitate the reaction because the produced hydrogen from dehydrogenation can directly be consumed via the RWGS reaction. To verify this assumption, barrier calculations were conducted on the two most energetically demanding H2 formation steps (P1; C4H8Ga–H → C4H7O + HGaH → C4H7O + H2 and P2; C6H10Ga–H → C6H9O + HGaH → C6H9O + H2). The effect of CO2 on the mechanism and kinetics for these two H2 formation steps was investigated. As shown in the insets of Figure 6, the formation of H2 must overcome large barriers at both selected P1 and P2 steps in the absence of CO2, with barrier values of 2.97 and 2.86 eV, respectively. However, in the presence of CO2, the produced H directly hydrogenated CO2 to COOH, which then dissociated to CO and OH. The OH bound at the Ga+ site took the other H from C4H8 or C6H10 to produce H2O on the active site. Thus, in the presence of CO2, the reaction mechanism was altered and the formation of molecular H2 was avoided, and most importantly, the P1 and P2 barriers were significantly reduced.

These DFT results demonstrated a promoting effect of CO2 on the production of aromatics over Ga/ZSM-5. However, flow reactor experiments over Ga/ZSM-5 illustrated that the presence of CO2 does not increase the selectivity to aromatics. This difference can likely be attributed to the instability of the ZSM-5 framework in the presence of water under CO2-ODA reaction conditions due to the strong adsorption of H2O on active sites. As demonstrated by flow reactor studies, modifying the Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst with P enhanced the production of aromatics and limited coke formation in the presence of CO2, indicating that one of the crucial roles of P is to improve the hydrothermal stability of the ZSM-5 framework.
Role of P in DDA and CO2-ODA over Ga/ZSM-5/P
To construct the Ga/ZSM-5/P catalyst model, a H3PO4 species was introduced into the Ga/ZSM-5 pore that interacted with not only the Brønsted acid site but also framework oxygen atoms by forming multiple H bonds, as illustrated in Supporting Information Figure 22a. This species was also reported as the most likely structure of P within the ZSM-5 pore in the literature. (32−34) Due to the covering of the original Brønsted acid site located on the bridging O atom of framework Si–O–Al, a new weak Brønsted site was created within the H3PO4 species. DFT calculations showed that the binding energy of H2O at the new Brønsted acid site was weakened from −1.01 to −0.74 eV when the H3PO4 species was included inside the Ga/ZSM-5 pore (structures shown in Supporting Information Figure 23), suggesting that the water resistance of the Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst should be improved in the presence of P, consistent with the experimental results.
The intrinsic role of P in the DDA reaction was then explored. Similar to that identified on Ga/ZSM-5, ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene catalyzed by the new Brønsted acid site of Ga/ZSM-5/P was kinetically unfavorable due to a large activation barrier of 2.65 eV (Supporting Information Figure 24a). Instead, a Brønsted–Lewis acid pair cooperative catalysis was still required. Transfer of the Brønsted acid proton of Ga/ZSM-5/P to the Ga+ site resulted in the generation of the [GaH]2+ active site (structure shown in Supporting Information Figure 22b), and this step was 0.31 eV endothermic with a barrier of 1.24 eV. Compared to the proton transfer step over Ga/ZSM-5, which had a barrier of 1.61 eV and a reaction energy of 0.53 eV, the formation of the [GaH]2+ site became more facile in the presence of P. Catalyzed by [GaH]2+, the minimum energy pathway for ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene was identified (Supporting Information Figure 24b, optimized structures shown in Supporting Information Figure 25), which had a barrier of 2.09 eV. Compared to that which occurred on Ga/ZSM-5 (barrier of 1.87 eV), although adding P created weak Brønsted acid site, the catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation was not significantly reduced because the reaction was catalyzed by the [GaH]2+ site that required the Brønsted–Lewis acid pair cooperation. The presence of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites was confirmed on Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P from the FTIR characterization following the adsorption of pyridine (Supporting Information Figure 26). Both samples showed the spectroscopic features of Brønsted acid (∼1545 cm–1) and Lewis acid (∼1455 cm–1), indicating the presence of both types of acid sites. The intensity (peak area) of the adsorbed pyridine vibrational peaks at 1545 and 1455 cm–1 were used to estimate the ratio of Lewis-to-Brønsted (L/B) using the reported extinction coefficients (ϵL = 3.26 cm/μmol, ϵB = 4.32 cm/μmol) by Schreiber et al. (27) The FTIR results also showed that the ratio of L/B decreased from 0.28 on Ga/ZSM-5 to 0.09 on Ga/ZSM-5/P, consistent with the DFT model that in the presence of P, Ga bonded to additional O atoms of H3PO4 (see Supporting Information Figure 22b), which resulted in a decrease in the number of Lewis acid sites and correspondingly a decrease in the L/B ratio for Ga/ZSM-5/P, as observed in the FTIR experiment.
To examine the effect of P on benzene formation from ethylene aromatization, the minimum energy pathways based on reaction energies over Ga/ZSM-5/P were calculated and compared with those obtained over Ga/ZSM5, as shown in Supporting Information Figure 27. The optimized structures of reactant, intermediates, and product are illustrated in Supporting Information Figure 28. Although Ga/ZSM-5/P generated similar pathways as Ga/ZSM-5, the binding strength of species and reaction energies were altered in the presence of P. For instance, the binding energy of benzene decreased by 0.69 eV over Ga/ZSM-5/P, indicating a faster desorption of benzene product from the Brønsted acid site. The effect of P on the H2 formation barriers were further calculated, and the results (Figure 7) showed a decrease in barriers associated with the two elementary steps involved in each H2 formation reaction. The presence of P species not only modified the acid site strength but also tuned the pore structure of ZSM-5, thus influencing the stability of intermediates and transition states inside the pore. On the basis of these DFT results, benzene formation should be promoted by the reduction in the H2 formation barriers over Ga/ZSM-5/P comparied to Ga/ZSM-5, consistent with experimental results given in Table 1.

Transition state configurations generated over Ga/ZSM-5/P are provided (yellow: Si, pink: Al, brown: Ga, red: O, gray: C, bright green: H of H3PO4, bright blue: H of HZSM-5, dark blue: P).
In the flow reactor experiments, the cofeeding of CO2 enhanced the rate and selectivity toward aromatics production only when Ga/ZSM-5 was modified by P. Additional DFT calculations were performed to investigate the role of CO2 for Ga/ZSM-5/P on CO2-ODA. H2 formation from C6H10Ga–H → C6H9O + HGaH → C6H9O + H2 was examined as a case reaction (optimized structures of all states involved shown in Supporting Information Figure 29). Both the hydrogen consumption mechanism and kinetic barriers were altered when CO2 participated in the reaction and was eventually transformed into CO and H2O. As shown in Figure 8, CO2 reacted with the H(Ga) site and formed COOH in the first step, followed by COOH dissociation into CO and OH(Ga). H transfer from the C6H10(Ga) species to OH(Ga) generated a H2O molecule, simultaneously forming a C6H9O species. The change in the elementary steps for the H consumption reaction lowered the barriers as compared to that which occurred in the absence of CO2 wherein H2 was produced with high barriers. In the presence of CO2, the promoting role of adding P into Ga/ZSM-5 toward aromatics production became more significant (overall barrier decreased by 0.4 eV compared to that without CO2 on Ga/ZSM-5/P as shown in Figure 8), consistent with the experimental results.

Overall, DFT calculations in this study have identified that the Brønsted–Lewis acid pair site is responsible for the increased activity of Ga-modified ZSM-5 over the unmodified catalyst. DFT calculations also provided insight into the role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over Ga/ZSM-5. High barriers for CO2 hydrogenation and strong H2O binding energy on Ga sites impaired the production of ethylene compared to the reaction in the absence of CO2. However, CO2 had a positive effect on the subsequent aromatization of ethylene by decreasing the barriers of the energetically demanding H2 formation steps by consuming hydrogen via the RWGS reaction. The flow reactor experiment and DFT calculation demonstrated that adding P to Ga/ZSM-5 can weaken the binding energy of H2O at the Brønsted acid site and consequently improve the hydrothermal stability of the zeolite framework. More importantly, adding P into Ga/ZSM-5 facilitated aromatics formation by lowering the H2 formation barriers. In the presence of CO2, the promoting effect of P incorporation became more significant, because the consumption of H via CO2 hydrogenation to CO and H2O (RWGS) avoided the formation of molecular H2 and sufficiently lowered the kinetic barriers.
Discussion
In this study Ga/ZSM-5 was used as a benchmark catalyst because of the reported ability of Ga to increase the activity of ZSM-5 for the DDA of ethane. As anticipated, Ga effectively increased the C2 conversion and selectivity to aromatics for the DDA pathway compared to unmodified ZSM-5. The Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst also improved the C2 conversion and aromatic selectivity compared to unmodified ZSM-5 for the CO2-ODA of ethane, but compared to the results under DDA conditions, the presence of CO2 did not result in a significant improvement in the production of aromatics. This is contrary to the thermodynamic calculations of using CO2 as a mild oxidant.
One critical change upon the introduction of CO2 to the dehydrogenation/aromatization pathway was the formation of water. The presence of water under reaction conditions has been shown to be problematic for zeolites as it causes dealumination and therefore a change in the zeolitic framework. Several studies have shown that P-modification prevents structural changes of the zeolite by stabilizing lattice aluminum ions in the tetrahedrally coordinated framework, but exactly how or the specific type of effective P species that is capable of these functions is not well understood. (19,35−37) Xue et al. demonstrated that P interacted with exposed silanol nests that are formed by the dealumination process and created new hydrothermally stable acid sites when exposed to water molecules under reaction conditions, indicating that the role of P was to fill the zeolitic position that was left exposed due to dealumination by coupling with the expelled aluminum species. (38) Thus, the insertion of P into the zeolitic framework stabilized and protected against the reoccurrence of dealumination. Lercher et al. proposed that during P-modification with phosphoric acid the oxygen of the strongly acidic bridging OH groups of ZSM-5 are replaced by two much less acidic OH from PO4H2–. (39) Altogether, the modification of ZSM-5 with P converted strong Brønsted acid sites into weak ones, thereby increasing the density of the weak Brønsted acid sites in the catalyst. This change in the overall acidity of the catalyst as a result of creating a reinforced water-tolerant framework helped reduce coke formation because there is a reduction in the number of highly acidic sites on which cracking is favorable.
In the present study, the incorporation of P on Ga/ZSM-5 with a loading as low as 0.2 wt % improved C2 conversion and aromatic selectivity of the CO2-ODA reaction. As the loading of P increased, the liquid aromatic yield and catalyst stability continued to improve as well. Contrary to the trend with Ga/ZSM-5, the activity of Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) under CO2-ODA reaction conditions showed higher liquid aromatic yield compared to the results in the absence of CO2. This indicated that P helped stabilize the catalyst in the presence of water formed by RWGS and allowed the benefits of cofeeding CO2 to enhance the selectivity toward aromatics. In addition, the P-modified Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts showed decreased selectivity to methane compared to Ga/ZSM-5, but the selectivity to CO remained similar. This may be indicative that P decreased cracking reactions (reduced amount of methane and coke) and overoxidation compared to Ga/ZSM-5. The inhibition of cracking reactions that form methane and coke was further supported by the TGA experiments performed over Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8), which illustrated that the P-modified catalyst contained less coke.
Further understanding of the Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) catalyst was obtained via reaction order and activation barrier experiments. The trends obtained via the reaction order experiments illustrated that CO2 and C2 may be competing for the same type of active site, and that increasing one reactant over the other (especially CO2) decreased the production of aromatics. Finally, to gain understanding regarding the type of carbon that formed aromatics under CO2-ODA reaction conditions, 13CO2 isotope experiments were performed with Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8). These results revealed that carbon in the liquid aromatic products came from ethane instead of CO2.
DFT calculations identified that the high-activity of ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene over Ga-modified ZSM-5 was due to the synergetic catalysis induced by a Brønsted–Lewis acid site pair. In the presence of CO2, ethylene production was impaired due to the increased barrier caused by H2O coadsorption at the active site. With respect to ethylene aromatization to benzene, the H2 formation steps had considerable barriers and could be the slow steps within the elementary pathways associated with ethylene transformation to benzene over Ga/ZSM-5. Upon the introduction of CO2, the hydrogen consumption mechanism was altered due to the direct participation of CO2 and its conversion to CO and H2O via RWGS. Most importantly, CO2 involvement in the reaction can promote benzene formation by reducing kinetic barriers. DFT results helped confirm that P-modification on Ga/ZSM-5 can improve hydrothermal stability and suppress coke formation, as a weakening of H2O binding energy at the Brønsted acid site was obtained in the presence of P. In addition, the introduction of P not only modified the acid site strength but also tuned the pore structure of Ga/ZSM-5, resulting in reduced H2 formation barriers and enhanced aromatics formation. More importantly, the promoting effect of P addition on aromatics production became more significant when CO2 was cofed with ethane, through which the pathway for the formation of molecular H2 was circumvented and the kinetic barriers were reduced.
Conclusions
In summary, the tandem reactions of CO2-assisted ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization have the potential to produce liquid products of higher value from inexpensive and abundant shale gas while mitigating a greenhouse gas. We report for the first time the impact of P-modification on Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for the CO2-ODH of ethane and have identified Ga/ZSM-5/P(0.8) as a promising CO2-ODA catalyst with greater activity and stability than Ga/ZSM-5. The incorporation of P at a loading of 0.8 wt % improves the hydrothermal stability of Ga/ZSM-5, reduces coke formation, and allows for the formation of more liquid aromatics via the CO2-ODA reaction pathway compared to DDA. The role of CO2 in the CO2-ODA reaction is to help aid in the formation of ethylene and consequently enhance aromatic formation via the consumption of H2. The 13CO2 isotope experiments confirm that aromatics do not contain carbon from CO2. DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanisms for ethane transformation to aromatics and elucidate the important role of P and CO2 in promoting the selectivity toward aromatics. Future efforts should be geared toward enhancing aromatics yield through the design of zeolite-based materials by introducing promoters that are capable of improving the hydrothermal stability as well as the activation of CO2.
Experimental Methods
Flow Reactor Studies
Flow reactor experiments were performed under atmospheric pressure utilizing a 4 mm quartz tube. All catalysts were pretreated with an activation period under Ar flow for 1 h at 873 K (20 mL/min, 9.6 K/min ramp) before contacting reaction gases. Steady-state experiments were performed with 300 mg of 40–60 mesh catalyst particles. Apparent activation barrier reaction order experiments were conducted at slightly different reaction conditions to minimize the effects of heat and mass transport.
Density Functional Theory Calculations
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the ion cores represented by the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials implemented in VASP. (40−42) The MFI-type zeolite was modeled by using a periodic unit cell with experimentally determined lattice constant of 20.02 Å × 19.90 Å × 13.38 Å. The exchange and correlation energies were treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh of (PBE) functional, (43) and the DFT-D3 method (44,45) was used to consider the dispersion interaction of the zeolite system. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave basis set was set to 400 eV. A Γ-point was applied for all calculations and the Gaussian smearing with an electronic temperature of kBt = 0.02 eV was employed to achieve fast convergence. Structure optimizations were conducted using a damped molecular dynamics method implemented in VASP until the forces on all atoms were less than 0.03 eV/Å.
Transition states were searched using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) (46) method. The minimum energy pathway was examined using 8–14 images, including the initial and final state, during the transition state search. Each transition state was confirmed to have a single imaginary vibrational frequency along the reaction coordinate. Zero-point energy, heat capacity, and entropy were computed with standard methods for adsorbates and gas phase molecules, and then used to convert the electronic energies into free energies at temperature of 873 K to correlate experiments.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Thermodynamic analysis. Effect of temperature on the (a) equilibrium conversion of reactants and (b) mol % of benzene product for the DDA and CO2-ODA reactions. Effect of temperature on the equilibrium composition for the (c) DDA and (d) CO2-ODA reactions. DDA was evaluated by direct dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and subsequent aromatization of ethylene to benzene with an initial feed of Ar/C2 of 1:1, while CO2-ODA included the simultaneous occurrence of the RWGS reaction with an initial feed of CO2/C2 of 1:1. Calculations were performed with the assistance of HSC Chemistry Outotec software v8.

Figure 2. Impact of phosphorus wt %. The influence of P(X) on the CO2-ODA reaction over 2 wt % Ga on ZSM-5 (Si/Al 30 molar) modified with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 wt % phosphorus. (a) Liquid yield vs C2 conversion and (b) stability represented by normalized C2 conversion. The stability of the catalysts is assessed by normalizing the reactant conversion by the value corresponding to 2 h on stream. The reported values of stability are the average of hours 9–10 on stream.
