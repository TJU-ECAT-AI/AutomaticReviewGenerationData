Abstract
SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes are successfully synthesized on α-Al2O3 hollow fiber ceramic substrates by secondary growth method, and used to separate H2 from a binary mixture (H2, C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8, and C3H6) under a wide temperature range (25–600°C) with the aim of using them for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions at high temperature. The results show excellent performance for H2/C3H8 and H2/ C3H8 & C3H6 separation, with high H2 permeance of 3.1 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 at 600°C. Additionally, the membrane shows stable performance for 140 hr of H2/C3H8 separation test at 600°C. The high performance of this membrane is mainly attributed to the thin (∼2 μm) zeolite layer and asymmetric-wall of the hollow fiber support. So far, this membrane offers the highest hydrogen permeation and selectivity for H2/C3H8 separation at high temperature (600°C) compared to those reported in literature.
1 INTRODUCTION
Zeolite membranes with small pore sizes (molecular dimensions) and uniform pore size distribution can be used to separate molecular mixtures via molecular size exclusion, adsorption or preferential adsorption.1, 2 In addition, inorganic zeolite membranes have high thermal, chemical and mechanical stability, which makes them suitable for high-temperature separation or high-temperature membrane reactor applications. Among various zeolite membranes, SAPO-34 zeolite membranes with small pore sizes (∼0.38 nm) are capable of separating light gas mixtures such as CO2/CH4, H2/CH4, H2/N2, and CO2/H2 gas separation.1, 3-10 Modified SAPO-34 membranes also showed good selectivity for H2/CO2 gas separation.11, 12 These studies were all reported for temperatures below 200°C. However, high temperature separation studies of SAPO-34 zeolite membranes are also important for the application of membrane reactors, as many important chemical reactions are operated at high temperatures, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction (operated at ∼600°C).13 Unfortunately, high-temperature separation studies involving SAPO-34 membranes are rarely reported in literature. So far, only one paper reported SAPO-34 zeolite membranes at high temperatures (∼650°C) for H2/C3H8 separation by using SAPO-34 membranes grown on tubular ceramic supports.14 However, the H2 permeance of said membranes could be further improved.
Ceramic hollow fiber supports allow high gas permeance due to their thin asymmetric walls (∼100 μm) compared to ceramic tubular supports (∼1 mm), while their small diameter of hollow fiber also allows for high packing density up to 1,000 m2/m3 to obtain greater membrane surface area per unit volume.10, 15-22 However, their greater curvature compared to tubular ceramic membranes makes the synthesis of zeolite layers on hollow fiber supports more challenging.23 Recently, two papers reported successful synthesis of SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes; one studied CO2/CH4 separation at room temperature, while the other studied N2/NF3 separation at 35°C.10, 24 Yet, neither reported high temperature application of SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes.
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an equilibrium reaction as shown in Reaction 1. The yield of propylene (C3H6) is heavily limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction. Simultaneous removal of generated H2 from the reaction stream via a membrane reactor can significantly enhance propane conversion if H2 permeation is high enough to significantly lower the partial pressure of H2 in the reaction stream and thus shift the equilibrium to produce more propylene.25 Hence, improving the H2 permeance through SAPO-34 zeolite membranes is critical to further enhance the yield of propylene via the SAPO-34 zeolite membrane reactor.

This paper demonstrates high performance SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membranes for H2/C3H8 separation at high temperature (∼600°C). The results show 50% higher permeance and 100% higher selectivity when compared with previously reported results.14 Furthermore, it is the first reported stability test for the as-synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane, which shows a good stability during a 140 hr test at 600°C.
2 EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Synthesis of SAPO-34 seeds
The precursor of SAPO-34 seeds had a molar ratio of 1.0 Al2O3: 2.0 P2O5: 0.6 SiO2: 4.0 TEAOH: 150H2O. Aluminum isopropoxide (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the source for aluminum; Ludox TMA colloidal silica (34 wt% SiO2 suspension in water, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the silica source, and Phosphoric acid (85 wt% aqueous solution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the source for phosphorous. Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) was used as the structuring directing agent (SDA) for seeds synthesis. The precursor solution was prepared as follows. TEAOH and water were first added into a sealed bottle and stirred for about 10 min. After which, aluminum isopropoxide powder was slowly added into the solution with continuous vigorous stirring follwed by dropwise addition of Ludox TMA colloidal silica into the above solution. The solution was stirred vigorously for another 2 hr until a homogeneous solution was formed. Thereafter, H3PO4 was added dropwise into the bottle for 2 hr. Then, the final solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180°C for 24 hr in a conventional oven.26 After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the seeds were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and dried in the oven overnight.
2.2 Preparation of α-Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane support
Commercial alumina powder (Baikowski, BMA-15, particle size with 100–200 nm), polyethersulfone (PESF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were used to make the precursor of α-Al2O3 hollow fiber. The casting solution had a mass ratio of 1 PESF: 5 NMP: 6 alumina. The casting solution was well-mixed for hollow fiber spinning by the phase inversion technique. The details were described in our previous studies.19, 27-40 The ceramic Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate was obtained after sintering at 1500°C for 5 hr.
2.3 SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane preparation
Approximately 20 mL of 1 wt% SAPO-34 seeds aqueous suspension was prepared by ultrasonication for 20 min. Hollow fiber supports were cut into 15-cm lengths before being cleaned with ethanol in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10mins to remove the dust particles and grease. The two-ends of the hollow fiber support were then wrapped tightly with PTFE-tape to prevent synthesis gel from contacting the inner surface of the supports. Dip-coating method was used in this study where the supports were immersed in prepared seeds-suspension for 5 min and lifted out slowly with ∼1 cm/s rate controlled by a dip-coating machine.35 The support was then dried in an oven at 100°C for an hour before being immersed in the seeds suspension again but upside down. This seeded membrane was then dried in a 100°C oven overnight before use.
Synthesis gel with a molar ratio of 1.0 Al2O3: 1.0 P2O5: 0.3 SiO2: 1.0 TEAOH: 1.6 DPA: 150H2O was prepared by first mixing deionized water and phosphoric acid in a gas-tight bottle. Aluminum isopropoxide was then slowly added and the mixture stirred for 2 hr before Ludox TMA colloidal silica was added dropwise. After that, the mixture was further stirred for another half an hour and TEAOH was added. Finally, DPA was added.
Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out by placing a single 15 cm long seeded support into the Teflon-lined autoclave filled with synthesis gel. The autoclave was then placed in an oven at 210°C for 4, 5, 7, 10, and 12 hr to produce different membranes as named M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 as shown in Table 1. After hydrothermal synthesis the autoclave was naturally cooled down under room temperature before the membranes were retrieved and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, and then dried in an oven at 100°C overnight. The template was removed from the membranes by subsequent calcination at 350°C for 3 hr followed by heating up to 550°C for 6 hr, with heating and cooling rates of 1°C/min in static air condition.

2.4 Permeability test
Before performing permeability test, defect checking was carried out for M0 to M5 membranes using pressurized N2 (3 × 105 Pa). The results are shown in Table 1. M0 membrane showed severe leakage through several pinholes along the membrane. Hence, permeation test was only carried out for M1 to M4 SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes. Membranes were used to separate a pre-mixed equimolar binary mixture (H2, C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8 and C3H6) at high temperatures. The membrane was assembled in a gas-permeation set-up as shown in Figure 1. Both ends of the SAPO-34 with length of ∼14 cm were connected to quartz tubes (ID = 2 mm and OD = 3.2 mm) by high-temperature silicone sealant (Dow Corning 736) that can withstand up to 300°C (shown in blue in Figure 1). The permeation cell was put in a tubular furnace with an effective heating length of approximately 60 mm. Then, the effective heating area of membranes is around 3 cm2. Feed gas containing 10 mL/min H2 and 10 mL/min C3H8 with/without 10 mL/min C3H6 was fed to the shell side while 40 mL/min of N2 was fed to the lumen side as sweep gas. The permeate gasses were sent to a gas chromatography system (Agilent 6,890 GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for analysis. For the M2 membrane, the pressure of the feed gas was also varied using a backpressure regulator to measure the effect of pressure on the H2 flux. Care was taken to ensure that the temperature ramp does not exceed 2°C/min when heating the membrane.

2.5 Characterization
The SAPO-34 phase structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000 power diffract meter) using Cu K-α radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Continuous scan mode was used to collect 2θ data from 5° to 50° at room temperature. The morphology of SAPO-34 zeolite membranes were measured using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6701F). The samples were degassed under vacuum condition to remove impurities. Platinum coating (about10nm thickness) was carried out at 30 mA for 90s to increase the electron conductivity for SEM. The volumetric porosity of the hollow fiber substrate was measured based on the gravimetric analysis of water entrapped in the pores of the fiber walls. The details were described in our previous studies.41 Carbon residue on the spent membrane after long-term test was measured via thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The spent membrane was broken into small pieces. Around 20 mg spent membrane pieces were used for TGA analysis and heated in static air while the temperature was increased to 900°C at a ramping rate of 10°C /min.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 SAPO-34 crystals
Figure 2a shows the SEM image of SAPO-34 seeds, which are nanosheet-like morphology with the thickness of 50–80 nm and length of 200–500 nm due to the mild hydrothermal conditions and the sequence in which the precursor solution was prepared.26 Smaller seeds can make seeding solution more uniform and stable, which allows for a more uniform seeding layer to be obtained by dip-coating method. This uniform thin seeding layer allows for the growth of a thin continuous zeolite membrane layer. Figure 2b shows the SEM image of precipitated SAPO-34 crystals after membrane synthesis during the hydrothermal condition of 210°C for 7 hr. It can be seen from Figure 2b that SAPO-34 crystals grew to large cube-like particles with size around 3–5 μm, showing that different synthesis conditions give rise to different morphology of SAPO-34 crystals. To confirm thermal stability of the synthesized SAPO-34, XRD characterization was studied for SAPO-34 before and after template removal at high temperature. It can be seen from Figure 3a,b that both XRD patterns of the SAPO-34 before and after calcination matches well with the standard XRD patterns of SAPO-34 (#47–0617), confirming good stability and high purity of the synthesized SAPO-34 even after treatment at high temperature.42

3.2 Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate
Figure 4 shows SEM images of Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate. It can be seen from Figure 4a,b that the outer diameter (OD) of the hollow fiber is around 1.5 mm and the thickness of the wall is around 0.15 mm. However, the effective wall thickness of the substrate is even thinner due to the unique asymmetric morphology of hollow fiber attributed to phase inversion fabrication method. In fact, the gas mass transfer resistance through the larger finger pores close to the inner side of the Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate is negligible.43 Hence, the overall mass transfer resistance through Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate is significantly lower than that of the traditional tubular Al2O3 substrate. The porosity of the Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate is around 41%. N2 permeation test through this hollow fiber substrate was conducted at room temperature under different pressure difference across the membrane. The result is shown in Figure 5, N2 permeance increased from 6.4 to 8.9 × 10−6 mol/m2/s/Pa with increasing the pressure difference across the membrane, which indicates the gas permeation is controlled by the combination of laminar flow and Knudsen diffusion as it shows the intercept and slope of gas permeation line.41, 43-45 The slope of N2 permeation lowers with increasing the pressure drop across the membrane. This behavior demonstrated that the contribution of Knudsen diffusion for gas permeation increases with increasing pressure difference across the membrane.41 As compared with the tubular substrate, H2 permeance of 1–2 × 10−6 mol/m2/s/Pa was reported in the literature.14 It can be seen that the mass transfer resistance through Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate is much lower than those through the tubular substrate.

N2 permeance through Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate
Figure 4c,d displays the external surface of Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate where the zeolite layer is generally grown. The surface morphology of the alumina substrate is important, as it affects the zeolite growth, as well as seeding quality. It can be seen from Figure 4d that the pore size on the external surface of Al2O3 hollow fiber substrate is about 100–500 nm. Large pore size makes it more difficult to obtain defect-free zeolite membranes while small pore size leads to an increase in mass transfer resistance through the substrate. Additionally, small pore size (dmax = 126 nm davg = 68 nm)substrate fabricated by Al2O3-YSZ mixture is also applied for synthesis SAPO-34 zeolite membrane, but the resulting membrane was observed to peel off from the substrate easily.41 The smoothness of the substrate, coupled with the greater curvature of hollow fiber membranes, leads to poor adhesion of the zeolite layer with the underlying substrate, thus peeling of the zeolite layer upon drying and calcination.
3.3 SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes
Figure 6 shows SEM images of cross section and zeolite layer surface for various SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes. It can be seen from Figure 6a,c,e,g that all membranes have uniform intergrown zeolite layers and the thickness of zeolite layer increases with increasing hydrothermal time, resulting in layer thickness of 2, 3.5, 7, and 11 μm for M1, M2, M3 and M4 membranes, respectively. Meanwhile, the crystal size of zeolite layers also gradually increased with synthesis time as shown in Figure 6b,d,f,h. The increase in layer thickness and crystal size is especially prominent for membranes M3 and M4, which underwent synthesis for over 10 hr. The XRD pattern of SAPO-34 membrane (M2) is shown in Figure. 3c and exhibits weak peaks (“♦”) of SAPO-34 crystal structure with no impurities. The strong peaks (“α”) are assigned to α-Al2O3 hollow fiber support with high intensity. Both imply that a thin SAPO-34 film is formed on the alumina hollow fiber support.

As-synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes (M1 to M4) were investigated for H2/C3H8 separation performance via an equimolar H2/C3H8 mixture at a wide temperature range (25–600°C). It can be seen from Figure 7 that the highest H2 permeance of 3.1 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa is obtained via M1 SAPO-34 membrane with a selectivity of 41 at 600°C. It is well known that there is a trade-off between permeance and selectivity in zeolite membranes. As the zeolite thickness layer increased, H2 permeance decreased to 2.5 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa but selectivity increased to 55. M3 and M4 membrane with thicker zeolite layer show much lower permeance (1.6 × 10−7 and 1.3 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa) but higher selectivity (207 and 272), respectively. Regarding the application of membrane reactor for PDH reaction, H2 permeance of more than 2 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa is required to effectively increase the conversion of PDH reaction.14 Hence, M1 and M2 SAPO-34 membranes are more suitable for this application. In addition, it can be seen from Figure 7a that H2 permeance rapidly increased with temperature at the beginning and the increment slowed down gradually, which indicates that the H2 permeation through SAPO-34 zeolite membrane with narrow zeolite pores follows an activated diffusion mechanism.46-49 It can also be seen from Figure 7b that H2 selectivity of all four membranes is very low at room temperature but increases sharply with increasing temperature until around 300°C. When the temperature went beyond 300°C, the H2 selectivity gradually decreased.

H2 permeance and selectivity at different temperature through M1, M2, M3 and M4 zeolite membranes [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
To investigate these phenomena, different gas permeance tests were performed on the M2 membrane at various temperatures, as shown in Figure 8. Interestingly, under either single gas permeation or mixed gas permeation, a similar performance with minimum permeance of C3H8 and C3H6 can be observed in the temperature range of 200–300°C. The pore size of SAPO-34 is 0.38 nm, while the kinetic diameter of C3H8 and C3H6 is 0.43 and 0.45 nm, respectively. Hence, the small permeance of C3H8 and C3H6 through the zeolite membranes can be mostly assigned to the existence of nonzeolitic pores on the membrane. These nonzeolitic pores decrease with increasing the thickness of zeolite membrane, which leads to the increase of H2/C3H8 selectivity as shown in Figure 7. The initial decrease of C3H8 and C3H6 permeance at low temperatures (﹤300°C) was because the permeation behavior is dominated by adsorption at low temperatures and the adsorption affinity between C3H8/C3H6 molecules and zeolite/nonzeolite pores decreases with increasing temperature.50, 51 When the temperature is higher than 300°C, Knudsen diffusion would play an increasing dominant role for the permeation of C3H8 and C3H6.23, 46-48, 52, 53 It can also be observed from Figure 8 that H2 permeance obtained from single and mixed gas permeation are quite similar at high temperatures (﹥300°C) but showed a difference at low temperatures (﹤300°C). When the temperature is below 300°C, H2 permeance obtained from mixed gas permeation is lower than that from single gas permeation. This phenomenon is mainly due to strong adsorption of C3H8 and C3H6 molecules to the zeolite membrane at low temperatures, which reduces H2 gas permeation. The difference of H2 permeance obtained from single and mixed gas permeation is smaller than that from other literature reported.2, 23 It can be explained that all gases for separation were smaller than the zeolite pores in the literature while C3H8 and C3H6 are much bigger than the pore size of SAPO-34. Hence, the effect of adsorption on H2 permeation in the mixed gas permeation is not severe like that from literatures.2, 23 Therefore, H2/C3H8 selectivity initially increased owing to the sharp increase of H2 permeation and the decrease of C3H8 permeation at low temperatures (﹤300°C), while the slow increase of H2 permeation and the increase of C3H8 permeation leads to the decrease in H2/C3H8 selectivity at high temperatures (﹥300°C) as shown in Figure 7.

Separation performance of single gas or ternary mixture gas (H2, C3H6 and C3H8) via M2 SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
Additionally, the separation performance of an equimolar ternary gas mixture (H2, C3H6 and C3H8) via SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane (M2) at high temperatures showed a good H2 permeance of ∼2.4 mol/m2/s/Pa at 600°C with high selectivity of H2/C3H8 (∼88) and H2/C3H6 (∼94) as shown in Figure 8b. H2 separation performance from this ternary mixture showed a similar permeance but better selectivity compared to the separation from binary mixture (H2 and C3H8). This remarkable performance of the synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane for H2 separation from simulated condition of propane dehydrogenation (H2, C3H6 and C3H8 at 600°C) confirms that the membranes meet the requirement of the membrane reactor for PDH reaction.
Long-term H2/C3H8 separation study was carried out on M2 SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane at 600°C for 160 hr test as shown in Figure 9. H2 permeation showed a drop at the initial ∼20 hr and maintained a stable performance during the 140 hr thereafter, while the selectivty did not change during 160 hr test. The initial decrease in H2 permeation is mainly attributed to coking on the zeolite membrane surface due to propane thermal cracking at high temperatures, which could increase mass transfer resistance for gas permeation. The surface of SAPO-34 consists of weak Lewis and Bronsted acidic sites that are active centers for causing cracking of propane and propylene to form coke.54-56 However, the stable performance of the SAPO-34 membrane after initial 20 hr can possibly be attributed to the surface converage of acidic sites of SAPO-34 membrane with coke. After 160 hr permeation, the external surface of SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane turned from an initial white colour to black colour from the coking. The spent membrane was broken into small pieces for carbon analysis using TGA. The results was shown in Figure 10a that a weight loss of ∼0.7% was observed when increasing temperature to 900°C, which is mainly due to carbon combustion. The morphology of the spent membrane was investigated using SEM (Figure 10b). It can be seen from Figure 10b that most of the carbon on the spent membrane surface is porous carbon nanofiber, which could not completely block the gas permeation through the zeolie membrane but decrease the permeance. This coking phenomenon is also observed in the commercial PDH processes, which requires frequent regeneration of catalysis via combustion of these carbon residues.57 Due to the high thermal stability of SAPO-34 membranes, coking on the membrane could also be removed via the same method used for regenerating the spent catalysts in commercial PDH reactors. The spent membrane was calcined at 650°C under air to remove the carbon residue on the membrane surface. After calcination, the dark surface of spent membrane turned back to white. The H2/C3H8 separation test was conducted on the regenerated membrane and showed that H2 permeance can be recovered to ∼2.3 mol/m2/s/Pa compared to ∼2.5 mol/m2/s/Pa for fresh membrane as shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information. Additionally, a similar trend is shown with an initial decrease followed by stable performance thereafter. For the future application of SAPO-34 zeolite membrane reactor in PDH reaction, it is possible to recover both catalysts and zeolite membrane simultaneously.

So far, only one paper reported high temperature H2/C3H8 separation via SAPO-34 and MFI zeolite membranes. A comparison between the results obtained from this work and those reported in the literature is shown in Table 2. It can be seen that M1 SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane showed a ∼ 50% more permeance and ∼ 100% more selectivity for H2/C3H8 separation than the best previously reported value for tubular SAPO-34 membrane at 600°C.14 This remarkable improvement is mainly due to the application of hollow fiber substrate in this work with much lower mass transfer resistance as compared with the tubular substrate used in the literature as shown in Figure 5. In that literature, the highest H2/C3H8 selectivity through the zeolite membrane was ∼23 at 600°C, and this membrane has delivered a good performance for PDH reaction.14 To further improve the performance of membrane reactor for PDH reaction, the increase in H2 permeance plays a more important role. The main benefit of a membrane reactor is simultaneous removal of hydrogen from the reaction system to overcome the limitation of thermal dynamic equilibrium in PDH reaction, thereby increasing the yield of propylene. In this work, the selectivity of all membranes are above of 23 and thus sufficient for membrane reactor in PDH reaction. Hence, M1 and M2 membranes with higher permeance could be more efficient for catalytic membrane reactor in PDH reaction. In addition, this is the first time long-term stability test was reported on SAPO-34 zeolite membrane for high temperature separation. M2 SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane showed a stable H2 permeation for 140 hr. These remarkable improved performances of the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite membrane hold good potential to improve the performance of PDH reaction via the SAPO-34 hollow fiber zeolite catalytic membrane reactor. Integrating catalysts with the SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane for real propane dehydrogenation will be studied in detail. Many conditions will affect the performance of the catalytic membrane reactor, such as the loading amount of catalyst, the position of catalyst, the feeding gas and sweeping gas rate, temperatures. This is an entire study and will be shown in our future work.

The synthesized SAPO-34 hollow fiber membranes show an exceptional performance for H2 separation from a binary mixture (H2, C3H8) or ternary mixture (H2, C3H8 and C3H6) at high temperatures (up to 600°C) with the highest H2 permeance of 3.1 × 10−7 mol/m2/s/Pa and H2/C3H8 selectivity of 41 at 600°C. H2 permeation through SAPO-34 zeolite membrane with narrowed zeolite pores follows an activated diffusion mechanism, while C3H8 and C3H6 permeation through the membrane with nonzeolitic pores is controlled by adsorption at low temperatures (﹤300°C) and Knudsen diffusion at high temperatures (﹥300°C). The H2/C3H8 separation stability test shows a stable performance for 140 hr for at 600°C.
