The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a pivotal process in the chemical industry for the conversion of inexpensive hydrocarbons into more valuable olefins, hinges on the efficient activation of C-H bonds, catalyst regeneration, and the judicious use of oxidants. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those based on vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten, have emerged as key players in this transformation due to their ability to facilitate C-H bond cleavage and subsequent dehydrogenation. These catalysts often operate in a redox cycle, where they are reduced by the alkane and then re-oxidized, typically by molecular oxygen, to regenerate the active state. However, the use of molecular oxygen as an oxidant can lead to issues such as over-oxidation and safety concerns. An innovative approach to address these challenges involves the utilization of CO2 as an alternative oxidant. CO2, being a benign and abundant greenhouse gas, not only mitigates environmental concerns but also participates in the redox cycle, promoting catalyst regeneration without the risk of over-oxidation. This strategy not only enhances the selectivity and efficiency of the dehydrogenation process but also paves the way for a more sustainable chemical industry.
