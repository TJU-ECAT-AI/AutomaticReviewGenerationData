Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

1.The literature does not provide information to directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx. The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts. Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step. The proposed mechanism for h-BN involves the heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds of propane followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is not discussed in the literature.

1.文献没有提供直接比较和对比氧化脱氢烷烃中氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的信息。但是，它确实提到六方氮化硼（h-BN）对碳氧化物的选择性非常低，而对乙烯的选择性相对较高，与V基催化剂相比，V基催化剂的主要副产品是COx。在h-BN和基于金属氧化物的催化剂中观察到的截然不同的产物分布表明，这两种催化剂的反应机制不同。通常，过渡金属氧化物催化下的ODHP反应被证明遵循氧化还原机制，其中丙烷由过渡金属氧化物的表面晶格氧氧化是速率限制步骤。对于h-BN提出的机制涉及丙烷的CH键的异裂，随后是气体相氧化剂的还原而不是表面。不同催化剂（如V2O5，VOx/SiO2，CeO2和过渡金属簇）在丙烷氧化脱氢中活化CO2的有效性在文献中没有讨论。
