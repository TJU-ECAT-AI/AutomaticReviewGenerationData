1.The literature does not provide information to directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx. The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts. Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step. The proposed mechanism for h-BN involves the heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds of propane followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface.

1.文献没有提供直接比较和对比氧化脱氢烷烃中红氧化和非红氧化金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的信息。但是，它确实提到六方氮化硼(h-BN)对碳氧化物的选择性非常低，而对乙烯的选择性相对较高，与V基催化剂相比，V基催化剂的主要副产品是COx。在h-BN和金属氧化物基催化剂中观察到的截然不同的产物分布表明，这两种催化剂的反应机制是不同的。通常，过渡金属氧化物催化下的ODHP反应被证明遵循红氧化机制，其中丙烷由过渡金属氧化物的表面晶格氧氧化是速率限制步骤。对于h-BN提出的机制涉及丙烷的CH键的异裂，随后是气体相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面。
