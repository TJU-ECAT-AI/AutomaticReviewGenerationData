Identifying Different Types of Catalysts for CO2 Reduction by Ethane through Dry Reforming and Oxidative Dehydrogenation Graphical Abstract Dry reforming of ethane using CO2 as oxidant over Pt- and Mo2C-based catalysts is reported. The two pathways of the reaction (see picture) were controlled by the choice of catalyst.
Abstract The recent shale gas boom combined with the requirement to reduce atmospheric CO2 have created an opportunity for using both raw materials (shale gas and CO2) in a single process. Shale gas is primarily made up of methane, but ethane comprises about 10% and reserves are underutilized. Two routes have been investigated by combining ethane decomposition with CO2 reduction to produce products of higher value. The first reaction is ethane dry reforming which produces synthesis gas (CO+H2). The second route is oxidative dehydrogenation which produces ethylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene. These findings are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of the catalysts under insitu reaction conditions.
Recent exploitation of shale gas reserves has increased the importance of using methane and the heavier gas fractions as raw materials for producing chemicals and fuels. Methane is the primary component of shale gas, but ethane comprises approximately 10%, with the exact concentration depending on the particular source.1 Most ethane is converted by thermal dehydrogenation into ethylene, a valuable commodity chemical, at high temperatures, between 750950C, in the presence of steam,2 which is energy-intensive and leads to coke formation on the reactor walls and catalyst bed.3 Catalysts that can effectively convert ethane to useful products at lower temperatures, without coke formation, are very desirable. Ideally, a catalyst that can use CO2 as the oxidant is particularly useful because the reduction of CO2 can help mitigate ocean acidification and climate change,4 while unreacted CO2 can also reduce coke formation through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2+C2CO), which has been shown to occur as low as 500C,5 thus increasing conversion and catalyst stability.3 CO2 reduction by ethane can proceed through two distinct pathways: 1)reforming to produce synthesis gas (2CO2+C2H64CO+3H2) and 2)oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce ethylene (CO2+C2H6C2H4+CO+H2O). For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.6 Dry reforming of ethane, however, becomes thermodynamically favorable at a lower temperature than for methane (ca. 600C), making the process more feasible under milder conditions.7 The difference in reaction temperatures between ethane and methane dry reforming also provides a potential opportunity for reactively separating shale gas, thereby directly producing synthesis gas from ethane and CO2, while leaving the methane unreacted.
ODH of ethane by CO2 is another important pathway because of the high energy requirement for the current ethane dehydrogenation processes.8 Several groups have studied ODH of ethane with pure O2,9 which is more reactive but does not have the added benefit of reducing CO2 emissions. ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism,10 where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct.11 At 600C, both the reforming and ODH reactions occur simultaneously, thus it is necessary to identify classes of catalysts to kinetically control the extent of reforming versus ODH. It is highly desirable to identify distinct types of catalysts that can 1)efficiently break the CC bond to produce synthesis gas, or 2)selectively break CH bonds of ethane while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene.
Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts. Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation.12 There is a support effect, with SiO2 displaying the highest activity,13 and doping the catalyst with small amounts of Fe, Co, and Mn further improves ethylene selectivity.14 The high activity of Cr-based catalysts could stem from their ability to exist in several oxidation states, similar to Mn-based molecular sieve catalysts.12 Ga2O5 and Ca-doped ThO2 are reducible materials that are also active and selective for this reaction,15 while a nanostructured CeO2 catalyst doped with CaO oxidizes ethane into CO and H2O, with ODH as the side reaction. For carbide catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 has about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity; however, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active.16 Although there have been studies into CO2 reduction by ethane, details are lacking on how to control the extent of dry reforming versus ODH. In the current study, two types of catalysts, metals (Pt-based) and metal carbides (Mo2C), are investigated under identical reaction conditions to differentiate the two reaction pathways. It is hypothesized that Pt and Mo2C-based systems are promising catalysts to study reforming and ODH during CO2 reduction by ethane because Pt catalysts supported on CeO217 and Mo2C18 are both active for RWGS from their high oxygen mobility, a critical feature required for CO2 reduction by ethane. The findings of this study confirm that although there is deactivation, Pt/CeO2 favors the reforming reaction and Mo2C-based catalysts are more selective at producing the ODH product, ethylene. These novel findings are supported by DFT calculations and insitu X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements.
To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates. The results in Table1 show that all intermediates bind more strongly on Mo2C(001) than on Pt(111). It is noted that, for adsorbates with similar binding configurations, the binding energy difference between Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is more pronounced for species adsorbed by the oxygen atom than those using the carbon atom. This is due to the much higher affinity of the Mo2C(001) surface toward O relative to Pt(111). The DFT calculated BEdiff is 3.53eV for atomic oxygen, while it is only 1.60eV for atomic carbon.

DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces. The CC bond cleavage of ethane produces CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g), while CH bond scission results in the formation of CH2CH2* and H2(g). For the case of Pt(111) in Figure1a, atomic hydrogen is assumed to form H2O(g) since both OH (O*+H*OH*) and H2O formation (H*+OH*H2O*) are exothermic processes on the Pt(111) surface.19 This is not the case, however, for Mo2C(001) in Figure1b, where both OH (O*+H*OH*) and H2O formation (H*+OH*H2O*) are highly endothermic processes.20 Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.

Furthermore, Figure1a shows that on Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*. More specifically, oxidation of ethane to form CH3CH2O* is energetically more favorable than the dehydrogenation of ethane to form CH3CH2* in the presence of oxygen on the surface. On Pt(111), CH3CH2O* undergoes two successive dehydrogenation reactions to form CH3CO*, which then undergoes CC bond cleavage to form CH3* and CO*. Thus, the Pt(111) surface promotes reforming of ethane to form CO.
A different reaction scheme from that on Pt(111) is observed on Mo2C(001). The stronger affinity of Mo2C(001) for oxygen makes CO bond formation less favorable on Mo2C(001) than on Pt(111), which agrees well with previous studies showing that Mo2C(001) binds carbon and oxygen very strongly, leading to spontaneous cleavage of the CO bond.21 Therefore, as shown in Figure1b, the Mo2C(001) surface preferentially dehydrogenates ethane to form CH2CH2*. Further discussion of the possible origins of the selective adsorption of different intermediate species over Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) is provided in the Supporting Information.
Further DFT calculations were performed on CeO2/Pt(111) to investigate the role of the PtCeO2 interface in the energy profile of reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The O-containing species bind at the PtCeO2 interface and most of the hydrocarbon species bind at the Pt sites, with detailed figures available in the Supporting Information. More importantly, the calculated energy profile for the reforming of ethane on CeO2/Pt(111) and Pt(111) in Figure1 shows a similar trend; however, the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable on CeO2/Pt(111), which is associated with the strong CeO2Pt(111) interaction22 and therefore strengthened binding of O-containing species at the interface, as shown in Table1. Thus, the DFT results suggest that similar to Pt(111), CeO2/Pt(111) also enhances the reforming of ethane.
To verify the DFT predictions, reactions of ethane and CO2 were evaluated in a quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. The activity and selectivity as a function of time on stream for the catalysts, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, are compared in Figure2. Furthermore, alloying Co with the Pt/CeO2 catalyst improves the catalytic stability. The comparison between the two catalysts clearly reveals differences in performance. Pt/CeO2 shows higher activity and selectivity toward reforming products, but Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 has a lower activity with increased ethylene selectivity, confirming the trend seen in the DFT calculations.

PtCo/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 with 5% H2 (dashed) are included in (a) and (c), respectively as references.
The difference in activity between the two classes of catalysts can be further explained through measuring the apparent activation barrier of both CO2 and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, as shown in Figure3. Over Pt/CeO2 the activation barriers are 16.0kcalmol1 and 21.6kcalmol1 for CO2 and ethane, respectively, and on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 the values are 19.5kcalmol1 and 17.5kcalmol1. The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2.23 Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Activation barrier plots represented as ln(TOF) versus 1/T for a)Pt/CeO2 and b)Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 at six temperatures. Values of TOF calculated by averaging data points between 24.5h on stream.
Because CeO2 has been shown to be an excellent support for reactions involving CO2, an additional test was performed by supporting Mo2C on CeO2. As seen in Table2, comparisons of conversion indicate there is a clear support effect for Mo2C, where γ-Al2O3 slightly improves the activity over the pure carbide, but CeO2 appears to diminish the activity. This support effect likely suggests that the greater acidity of γ-Al2O3 promotes the binding of ethane, which is consistent with previous work indicating that oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is strongly dependent on the acidity of support materials.24 However, future studies will be required to determine the effect of acidity on the reaction pathways of CO2 and ethane over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3.

Furthermore, the behavior of Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 is more similar to that of pure Mo2C than Mo2C/CeO2, which is likely from the low surface area and CO uptake of Mo2C/CeO2 (0.8μmolg1). It is also possible that the high intrinsic activity of both CeO2 and Mo2C21b towards CO2 bond scission creates an excess of adsorbed O on the catalyst surface, which quickly deactivates Mo2C/CeO2 through oxidation.
Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2. To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane. Clearly, as shown in the Supporting Information, the reaction order is negative with respect to ethane, meaning increasing concentrations of ethane decreases the catalytic activity. One explanation, obtained through DFT calculations, indicates the higher binding energy of oxygen on Mo2C destabilizes CO bond formation and leads to ethylene as the primary product. The high selectivity towards ethylene, combined with the high binding energy on Mo2C(001) (BEdiff=1.14eV relative to Pt(111)), likely leads to coke formation through ethylene decomposition or polymerization,25 partially explaining the deactivation and negative order.
To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity (Figure2c). This phenomenon has been seen in previous work over Mo2C-based catalysts for CO2 reduction by H2.18b As shown in Table2, the addition of H2 improves the initial catalytic activity, but the CO selectivity increases while that of ethylene decreases. The increased selectivity toward CO is likely because the addition of H2 promotes RWGS. Additionally, the Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can be regenerated through a post-reaction treatment cycle as shown in the Supporting Information.
To further understand the mechanism of deactivation over Mo2C, insitu XANES measurements were performed over pure Mo2C. Full details of the XANES experiments including spectra for pure Mo2C in various reaction environments as well as the difference spectra (ΔXANES) can be found in Figure4. The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane. To quantify these changes, each Mo spectrum was fitted by a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards, as described previously.18a The results of the linear combination fitting analysis are shown in Table3.

By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis. Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree. Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts.
In summary, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively. Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates. These findings agree with DFT predictions that the Pt(111) surface preferentially forms synthesis gas, while Mo2C(001) leads to ethylene formation. Future studies should focus on designing materials that selectively produce ethylene with high stability and minimal deactivation.
Experimental Section Spin-polarized DFT26 calculations were performed using plane wave basis set Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.27 A plane wave cut-off energy of 400eV and 3×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack28 grid were used for total energy calculations. Details of the DFT calculations are provided in the Supporting Information.
The synthesis procedures of Pt-based and Mo2C-based catalysts are provided in the Supporting Information. Reactions of ethane and CO2 were carried out in a quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. In each experiment, approximately 100mg catalyst (6080mesh) was loaded into the flow reactor. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced under a 1:1 hydrogen and helium mixture (40mLmin1 total flow) at 450C for 1h. To start the reaction, the flow of CO2 and ethane were each set at 10mLmin1 with 20mLmin1 of He as a diluent. For each experiment, the temperature was raised to 600C and the reaction was run for approximately 6h.
X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were used to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions. Catalyst samples were diluted with boron nitride, pressed into a pellet, then grinded and sieved (100150 mesh). The mass of catalyst and dilution were determined so the sample amount was two absorption lengths to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of each sample. The XAFS spectra for Mo2C was collected in a custom designed insitu glassy carbon cell,32 using a 4-channel vortex fluorescence detector.
