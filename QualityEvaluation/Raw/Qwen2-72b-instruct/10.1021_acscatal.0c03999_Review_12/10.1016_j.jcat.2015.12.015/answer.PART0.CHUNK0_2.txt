[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
[4] "The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction remain unclear and are dependent on the nature of the catalyst and its supporting material."
[5] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[6] "For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[7] "Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the RWGS."
[8] "Coupling of the reverse water gas shift reaction with DH therefore improves the equilibrium conversion in these DH reactions toward propylene production."
[9] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."
[10] "Herein we report on the dynamic behavior of the WOxVOx-based catalyst and have examined the role of CO2 and the effects of tungsten on its catalytic activity, selectivity toward propylene, structural characteristics of the catalyst and coke formation."
[11] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and in the absence of CO2."
[12] "The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C shows that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[13] "The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen ( = 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol)."
[14] "Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

1. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced during the dehydrogenation step and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. In the case of CO2, it can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (Quote [1]). This re-oxidation step is crucial for the regeneration of the catalyst's active sites. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not undergo such redox cycles and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. CO2 can play a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon (Quote [2]), which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been shown to be effective in utilizing CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides (Quote [5]). However, the mechanism and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are not fully understood (Quote [4]). CeO2 and transition metal clusters may have different mechanisms for CO2 activation, potentially involving the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (Quote [6]), which can eliminate hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (Quote [7]). The coupling of the RWGS reaction with dehydrogenation can improve the equilibrium conversion toward propylene production (Quote [8]). However, the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood (Quote [9]). DFT calculations have shown that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by the RWGS reaction (Quote [12]). The RWGS cycle is limited by hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen (Quote [13]). Overall, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via both ODH and DH followed by RWGS (Quote [14]).

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有显著差异。氧化还原活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以经历氧化还原循环，在脱氢步骤中金属氧化物被还原，然后通过传统氧化剂如O2或CO2进行再氧化。在CO2的情况下，它可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（引文[1]）。这个再氧化步骤对于催化剂活性位点的再生至关重要。非氧化还原活性催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，不会经历这样的氧化还原循环，而是依赖其他机制进行C-H键活化和催化剂再生。CO2可以在抑制表面碳形成方面发挥作用（引文[2]），这对催化剂稳定性和活性有益。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性各不相同。V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂已被证明在利用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面有效，CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物（引文[5]）。然而，这些催化剂上CO2分解的机制和能垒尚未完全理解（引文[4]）。CeO2和过渡金属簇可能具有不同的CO2活化机制，可能涉及逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应（引文[6]），可以消除非氧化脱氢反应产生的氢气（引文[7]）。将RWGS反应与脱氢耦合可以提高向丙烯生产的平衡转化率（引文[8]）。然而，CO2在基于钒氧化物的催化剂上在丙烷脱氢中的作用尚不清楚（引文[9]）。DFT计算表明，丙烷中二级CAH键的活化是直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢（DH）后跟RWGS反应的速率限制步骤（引文[12]）。RWGS循环受从钒位点到邻近桥氧的氢迁移限制（引文[13]）。总的来说，丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢可以通过ODH和DH后跟RWGS进行（引文[14]）。
