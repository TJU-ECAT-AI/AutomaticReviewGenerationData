[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed."
[4] "This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
[5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, involves the activation of C-H bonds through a redox mechanism. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen, can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation. In contrast, CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. The DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.

1.在红氧化金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2上，烷氧化脱氢涉及通过红氧化机制激活C-H键。传统氧化剂，如分子氧，可以将催化剂完全氧化到其原始状态，使活性位点能够连续再生，以进一步激活C-H键。相比之下，CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以部分氧化催化剂，如V2O3氧化为V2O4，虽然在完全再生催化剂方面效果较差，但仍然参与氧化脱氢过程。CO2在抑制表面碳形成方面的作用是显著的，因为它有助于保持催化剂的活性和选择性。对于红氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢中的激活效果较差，因为CO2解离的能量屏障较高。DFT计算证实，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后逆水煤气变换反应进行。速率限制步骤是丙烷的次级CAH键的激活，而催化剂与CO2的再氧化发生在更快的时间尺度上。
