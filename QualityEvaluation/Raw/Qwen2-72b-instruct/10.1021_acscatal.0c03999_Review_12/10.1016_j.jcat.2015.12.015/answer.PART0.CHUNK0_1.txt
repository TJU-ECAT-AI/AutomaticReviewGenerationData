[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

1.Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate C-H bonds in alkanes through a redox mechanism, where the metal oxide is reduced during the reaction and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, which is less oxidizing than V2O5, thus reducing the probability of total oxidation of propane. Redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through a different mechanism, possibly involving the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts involve the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, which is the rate-limiting step, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.

1.具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以通过氧化还原机制激活烷烃中的C-H键，其中金属氧化物在反应中被还原，然后通过传统的氧化剂如O2或CO2重新氧化。CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以将催化剂部分地重新氧化为V2O4，这比V2O5的氧化性要弱，从而降低了丙烷完全氧化的概率。非氧化还原活性的金属氧化物，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，可能通过不同的机制激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，可能涉及CO2在催化剂表面的解离。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性各不相同，V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其能够进行氧化还原循环而显示出更高的活性。CO2在这些催化剂上的解离机制涉及丙烷中二级CAH键的激活，这是速率限制步骤，而催化剂与CO2的重新氧化则在较短的时间尺度上发生。
