[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
[3] "This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."
[4] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

1.In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene. When D2, C3H8, and CO2 are fed together in a 1:1:1 ratio, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, indicating that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane, accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction and non-oxidative dehydrogenation. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. According to DFT calculations, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.

1.在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，CO2能够将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。当以1:1:1的比例同时喂入D2、C3H8和CO2时，只有45%的生成水含有D2O，这表明反应遵循丙烷的氧化脱氢途径，同时伴随着逆向水煤气变换反应和非氧化脱氢。CO2在抑制表面碳的形成方面起着重要作用。根据DFT计算，丙烷的二级CAH键的活化是CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的速率控制步骤，而催化剂与CO2的再氧化则在更短的时间尺度上发生。
