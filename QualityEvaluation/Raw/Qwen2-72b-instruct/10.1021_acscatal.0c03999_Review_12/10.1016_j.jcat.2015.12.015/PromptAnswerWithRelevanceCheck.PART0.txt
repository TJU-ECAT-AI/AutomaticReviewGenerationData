[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[3] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed."
[4] "This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
[5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

1.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, involves the activation of C-H bonds through a redox mechanism. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen, can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation. In contrast, CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. The DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.

1.在红氧化金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2上，烷氧化脱氢涉及通过红氧化机制激活C-H键。传统氧化剂，如分子氧，可以将催化剂完全氧化到其原始状态，使活性位点能够连续再生，以进一步激活C-H键。相比之下，CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以部分氧化催化剂，如V2O3氧化为V2O4，虽然在完全再生催化剂方面效果较差，但仍然参与氧化脱氢过程。CO2在抑制表面碳形成方面的作用是显著的，因为它有助于保持催化剂的活性和选择性。对于红氧化活性金属氧化物催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢中的激活效果较差，因为CO2解离的能量屏障较高。DFT计算证实，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后逆水煤气变换反应进行。速率限制步骤是丙烷的次级CAH键的激活，而催化剂与CO2的再氧化发生在更快的时间尺度上。

1.Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate C-H bonds in alkanes through a redox mechanism, where the metal oxide is reduced during the reaction and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, which is less oxidizing than V2O5, thus reducing the probability of total oxidation of propane. Redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through a different mechanism, possibly involving the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts involve the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, which is the rate-limiting step, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.

1.具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以通过氧化还原机制激活烷烃中的C-H键，其中金属氧化物在反应中被还原，然后通过传统的氧化剂如O2或CO2重新氧化。CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以将催化剂部分地重新氧化为V2O4，这比V2O5的氧化性要弱，从而降低了丙烷完全氧化的概率。非氧化还原活性的金属氧化物，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，可能通过不同的机制激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，可能涉及CO2在催化剂表面的解离。不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性各不相同，V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其能够进行氧化还原循环而显示出更高的活性。CO2在这些催化剂上的解离机制涉及丙烷中二级CAH键的激活，这是速率限制步骤，而催化剂与CO2的重新氧化则在较短的时间尺度上发生。

[13] "The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen ( = 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol)."

1. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced during the dehydrogenation step and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. In the case of CO2, it can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (Quote [1]). This re-oxidation step is crucial for the regeneration of the catalyst's active sites. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not undergo such redox cycles and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. CO2 can play a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon (Quote [2]), which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been shown to be effective in utilizing CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides (Quote [5]). However, the mechanism and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are not fully understood (Quote [4]). CeO2 and transition metal clusters may have different mechanisms for CO2 activation, potentially involving the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (Quote [6]), which can eliminate hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (Quote [7]). The coupling of the RWGS reaction with dehydrogenation can improve the equilibrium conversion toward propylene production (Quote [8]). However, the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood (Quote [9]). DFT calculations have shown that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by the RWGS reaction (Quote [12]). The RWGS cycle is limited by hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen (Quote [13]). Overall, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via both ODH and DH followed by RWGS (Quote [14]).

1. 在烷烃氧化脱氢中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有显著差异。氧化还原活性催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以经历氧化还原循环，在脱氢步骤中金属氧化物被还原，然后通过传统氧化剂如O2或CO2进行再氧化。在CO2的情况下，它可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯（引文[1]）。这个再氧化步骤对于催化剂活性位点的再生至关重要。非氧化还原活性催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，不会经历这样的氧化还原循环，而是依赖其他机制进行C-H键活化和催化剂再生。CO2可以在抑制表面碳形成方面发挥作用（引文[2]），这对催化剂稳定性和活性有益。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性各不相同。V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂已被证明在利用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面有效，CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物（引文[5]）。然而，这些催化剂上CO2分解的机制和能垒尚未完全理解（引文[4]）。CeO2和过渡金属簇可能具有不同的CO2活化机制，可能涉及逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应（引文[6]），可以消除非氧化脱氢反应产生的氢气（引文[7]）。将RWGS反应与脱氢耦合可以提高向丙烯生产的平衡转化率（引文[8]）。然而，CO2在基于钒氧化物的催化剂上在丙烷脱氢中的作用尚不清楚（引文[9]）。DFT计算表明，丙烷中二级CAH键的活化是直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢（DH）后跟RWGS反应的速率限制步骤（引文[12]）。RWGS循环受从钒位点到邻近桥氧的氢迁移限制（引文[13]）。总的来说，丙烷在CO2存在下的脱氢可以通过ODH和DH后跟RWGS进行（引文[14]）。

1.In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene. When D2, C3H8, and CO2 are present in the feed at a ratio of 1:1:1, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, indicating that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane, accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction and non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. According to DFT calculations, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.
2.Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the redox mechanism, where CO2 oxidizes the catalyst from V2O3 to V2O4. Redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may not be as effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their inability to undergo redox reactions. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are higher, making the activation of CO2 less favorable.

1.在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。当D2、C3H8和CO2以1:1:1的比例存在于进料中时，只有45%的生成水含有D2O，这表明反应遵循丙烷的氧化脱氢途径，同时伴随着逆向水煤气变换反应和非氧化脱氢途径。CO2在抑制表面碳的形成方面起着重要作用。根据DFT计算，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的速率限制步骤是丙烷二级CAH键的活化，而催化剂与CO2的再氧化发生在更快的时间尺度上。
2.具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以通过氧化还原机制激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，其中CO2将催化剂从V2O3氧化为V2O4。氧化还原非活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，可能在激活CO2进行氧化脱氢方面不如前者有效，因为它们无法进行氧化还原反应。这些催化剂上CO2的解离能垒较高，使得CO2的活化变得不那么有利。
