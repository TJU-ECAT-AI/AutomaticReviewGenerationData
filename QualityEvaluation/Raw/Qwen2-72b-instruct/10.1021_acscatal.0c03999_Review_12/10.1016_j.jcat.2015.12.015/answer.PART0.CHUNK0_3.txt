[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
[3] "This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."
[4] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

1.In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene. When D2, C3H8, and CO2 are present in the feed at a ratio of 1:1:1, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, indicating that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane, accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction and non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. According to DFT calculations, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.
2.Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the redox mechanism, where CO2 oxidizes the catalyst from V2O3 to V2O4. Redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may not be as effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their inability to undergo redox reactions. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are higher, making the activation of CO2 less favorable.

1.在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。当D2、C3H8和CO2以1:1:1的比例存在于进料中时，只有45%的生成水含有D2O，这表明反应遵循丙烷的氧化脱氢途径，同时伴随着逆向水煤气变换反应和非氧化脱氢途径。CO2在抑制表面碳的形成方面起着重要作用。根据DFT计算，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的速率限制步骤是丙烷二级CAH键的活化，而催化剂与CO2的再氧化发生在更快的时间尺度上。
2.具有氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，可以通过氧化还原机制激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，其中CO2将催化剂从V2O3氧化为V2O4。氧化还原非活性的金属氧化物催化剂，如CeO2和过渡金属簇，可能在激活CO2进行氧化脱氢方面不如前者有效，因为它们无法进行氧化还原反应。这些催化剂上CO2的解离能垒较高，使得CO2的活化变得不那么有利。
