1.The literature does not provide information to directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. It does not discuss the role of traditional oxidants and CO2 in detail for different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters. The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly mentioned.

1.The literature does not provide specific information to directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention that the use of CO2 as an alternative to oxygen can avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The literature also highlights the potential of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant, due to ceria's oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is not directly discussed, but the literature does suggest that Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show promising catalytic performance and enhanced stability for this reaction.

1.文献没有提供直接比较和对比红氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的具体信息。但是，它确实提到使用CO2作为氧气的替代品可以避免烷/烯的深度氧化，减少焦炭的形成，并由于产生的氢参与逆向水煤气转换反应而有利于丙烷的转化。文献还强调了Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢中的潜力，这是由于CeO2的氧移动性和氧储存容量。文献没有直接讨论不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性，但文献确实表明Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在该反应中显示出有希望的催化性能和增强的稳定性。

However, it does mention that Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts are highlighted as key properties that contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites. Fe3+ is introduced into the ceria lattice due to its activity in propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation. The literature does not provide detailed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation over different catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters.
