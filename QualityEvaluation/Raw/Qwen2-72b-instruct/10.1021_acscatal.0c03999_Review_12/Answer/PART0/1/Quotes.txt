          [2] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group."
          [3] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly."
          [4] "This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."
          [5] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."
          [6] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."
          [7] "On a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

          [5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
          [6] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."

          [17] "The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen ( = 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol)."

          [2] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group."
          [3] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly."
          [4] "This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."
          [5] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."
          [6] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."
          [7] "On a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."
          [8] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."
          [9] "Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation."

[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
          [2] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
          [3] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed."
          [4] "This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
          [5] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
          [6] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
          [7] "This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."
          [8] "The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction remain unclear and are dependent on the nature of the catalyst and its supporting material."
          [9] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
          [10] "For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
          [11] "Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the RWGS."
          [12] "Coupling of the reverse water gas shift reaction with DH therefore improves the equilibrium conversion in these DH reactions toward propylene production."
          [13] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."
          [14] "Herein we report on the dynamic behavior of the WOxVOx-based catalyst and have examined the role of CO2 and the effects of tungsten on its catalytic activity, selectivity toward propylene, structural characteristics of the catalyst and coke formation."
          [15] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and in the absence of CO2."
          [16] "The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C shows that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
          [17] "The RWGS cycle seems to be limited by its fourth elementary step, namely hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen ( = 189 kJ/mol, Eact = 185 kJ/mol)."
          [18] "Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
