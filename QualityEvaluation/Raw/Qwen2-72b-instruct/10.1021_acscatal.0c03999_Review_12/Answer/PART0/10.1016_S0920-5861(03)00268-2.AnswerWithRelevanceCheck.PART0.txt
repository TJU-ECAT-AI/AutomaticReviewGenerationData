          The literature does not provide detailed mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, it does mention that CO2 plays a role in maintaining a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species during the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. This suggests that CO2 can act as an oxidant to regenerate the catalysts. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is not directly compared in the literature, but it does state that the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst exhibited high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes.

          文献没有提供红氧化还原活性和红氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢烷烃中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的详细机制。但是，它确实提到CO2在维持氧化金刚石支撑的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在较低烷烃脱氢过程中铬和钒物种的较高氧化态中起作用。这表明CO2可以作为氧化剂来再生催化剂。文献中没有直接比较不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性，但它确实指出氧化金刚石支撑的V2O5催化剂在C3和C4烷烃脱氢中表现出高催化活性。
