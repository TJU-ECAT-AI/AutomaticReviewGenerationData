In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 plays a pivotal role as an oxidant, maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species over Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, facilitating catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, donating oxygen to alkanes to form alkenes and water, with catalyst regeneration via CO2 reduction \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, e.g., Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, yielding CO and *O for dehydrogenation, but risk cracking and coke formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, while CO2 is milder and prevents over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are effective for CO2 activation due to redox properties and oxygen mobility, with varying energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst demonstrates high activity for dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes, highlighting its effectiveness in CO2 activation for oxidative dehydrogenation processes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxides are not well-documented in the literature \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. In oxidative dehydrogenation, redox-active oxides activate C-H bonds via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, forming water and leaving an oxygen vacancy that requires an oxidant for regeneration \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Redox-inactive oxides directly reduce the oxidant without forming a vacancy \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. CO2 as an oxidant can either dissociate directly or be hydrogenated before forming CO \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation (3.16 eV), making the process difficult \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. VOx/SiO2 has a lower barrier (1.76 eV) but still significant \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. CeO2 (110) surfaces with oxygen vacancies have a lower barrier (1.36 eV) for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Transition metal clusters are highly active for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 activate C-H bonds through redox cycles, with CO2 partially oxidizing the catalyst from V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, have less effective CO2 activation due to higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. DFT calculations confirm CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation proceeds via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step, while catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 is faster \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are more effective in utilizing CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts with optimized redox properties and oxygen mobility for more efficient CO2 activation. The investigation of the role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains an open question, warranting further exploration. The design of bifunctional catalysts that can effectively dissociate CO2 into CO and *O, which effects dehydrogenation, is a promising direction. Understanding the detailed mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxides could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with enhanced stability and selectivity. The use of DFT calculations to predict energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on various catalysts could guide the rational design of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. The exploration of alternative oxidants and their impact on catalyst regeneration and selectivity could also be a fruitful area of research.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a critical process in the petrochemical industry, is significantly influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the oxidant \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, where oxygen is donated to the alkane to form alkenes and water, with CO2 regenerating the catalyst by refilling lattice oxygen vacancies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 heterolytically into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates alkanes, but bind alkanes at acidic sites, risking cracking and deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, unlike CO2, which is milder and avoids over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Catalysts' effectiveness for CO2 activation varies: V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 are highly active due to redox properties and oxygen mobility, while transition metal clusters like Mo2C are also effective \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2 dissociation mechanisms involve activation by the catalyst, with energy barriers influenced by redox properties, and catalyst stability and selectivity are crucial for overall reaction effectiveness \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

In oxidative dehydrogenation, redox-active metal oxides activate C-H bonds via the MvK mechanism, forming water and an oxygen vacancy that requires an oxidant for catalyst regeneration \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Redox-inactive oxides directly reduce the oxidant without forming a vacancy \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. CO2 can act as an oxidant through direct dissociation or hydrogenation before CO formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation, VOx/SiO2 has a lower but still significant barrier, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters show easier CO2 dissociation, highlighting their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

Redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 activate C-H bonds through a redox mechanism, with CO2 partially oxidizing the catalyst to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

CO2 maintains higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, acting as an oxidant for catalyst regeneration over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Notably, V2O5 exhibits high catalytic activities for dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, transition metal oxides follow a redox mechanism where propane oxidation by surface lattice oxygen is rate-limiting \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. h-BN, in contrast, involves heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds followed by gas phase oxidant reduction, showing high ethylene selectivity \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. The literature lacks direct comparison between redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts but highlights the differing mechanisms \[10.1002/anie.202002440\]. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters activate CO2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, though the literature does not discuss their effectiveness in detail \[10.1002/anie.202002440\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more efficient catalysts for CO2 activation, particularly in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The role of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which avoids over-oxidation, presents a promising avenue for the design of catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability. The effectiveness of catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane suggests that further investigation into their mechanisms and optimization could lead to significant improvements in the process. Additionally, the exploration of alternative redox-inactive catalysts that can overcome the limitations of cracking and deactivation while maintaining high activity for CO2 activation is a promising direction. The integration of computational methods, such as DFT calculations, with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration, guiding the rational design of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation.
