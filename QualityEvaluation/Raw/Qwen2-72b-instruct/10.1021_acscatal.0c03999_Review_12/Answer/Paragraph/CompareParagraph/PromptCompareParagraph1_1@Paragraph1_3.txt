The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a critical process in the petrochemical industry, is significantly influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the oxidant. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, donating oxygen to the alkane to form an alkene and water, with CO2 regenerating the catalyst by refilling lattice oxygen vacancies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates the alkane but can lead to cracking and coke formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, whereas CO2, a milder oxidant, avoids this issue \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are effective for CO2 activation due to their redox properties and oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional catalyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and *O, which effects dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active catalysts typically having lower barriers \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

V2O5, supported on oxidized diamond, exhibits high catalytic activities for dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes, highlighting its effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation processes \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. In oxidative dehydrogenation, redox-active metal oxides activate C-H bonds via the MvK mechanism, forming water and leaving an oxygen vacancy that requires an oxidant for regeneration \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Redox-inactive oxides directly reduce the oxidant without forming vacancies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. CO2 as an oxidant can either dissociate directly or be hydrogenated before CO formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation (3.16 eV), VOx/SiO2 has a lower barrier (1.76 eV), while CeO2 facilitates easier CO2 dissociation (1.36 eV) \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Transition metal clusters are also active for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, redox-active metal oxides like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 activate C-H bonds through a redox mechanism, with CO2 partially oxidizing the catalyst to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

CO2 suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, have less effective CO2 activation due to higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 show higher activity in utilizing CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

The role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains unclear \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 can eliminate hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, improving equilibrium conversion toward propylene production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature highlights the effectiveness of redox-active metal oxides, particularly V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with CO2 serving as a mild oxidant that regenerates the catalyst and avoids over-oxidation. The role of CO2 in suppressing surface carbon formation and enhancing catalyst stability is crucial for maintaining activity over extended periods. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their redox capabilities.

Future research endeavors might focus on the development of bifunctional catalysts that can efficiently dissociate CO2 into CO and *O, which effects dehydrogenation. The exploration of transition metal clusters and CeO2 as alternative catalysts for CO2 activation, given their lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, presents an exciting avenue for investigation. Additionally, the integration of the RWGS reaction with dehydrogenation to improve equilibrium conversion toward propylene production could be a promising strategy for enhancing overall process efficiency.

The role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains an area of uncertainty that warrants further exploration. Understanding the mechanism and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts could provide insights into optimizing catalyst design for enhanced CO2 activation. Moreover, the development of catalysts that can effectively suppress surface carbon formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity for propylene production is a critical challenge for future research.

In summary, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as an oxidant presents a sustainable and efficient route for alkane conversion. The effectiveness of redox-active metal oxides, particularly V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, in this process is well-established. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, exploring the potential of transition metal clusters and CeO2, and integrating the RWGS reaction to improve process efficiency. Addressing the uncertainties surrounding the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts and developing catalysts that can suppress surface carbon formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity will be crucial for advancing this field.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, is a critical process for the production of light olefins, with CO2 emerging as a promising oxidant for catalyst regeneration and C-H bond activation \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen is donated to the alkane, forming alkenes and water, with CO2 refilling the oxygen vacancies for catalyst regeneration \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, whereas CO2 is milder and prevents over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are effective for CO2 activation due to their redox properties and oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2 dissociation mechanisms involve activation by the catalyst, forming CO and *O, with energy barriers varying by catalyst type \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Redox-active metal oxides typically have lower barriers due to their redox properties \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The utilization of CO2 as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to alkane conversion. The effectiveness of CO2 in catalyst regeneration and C-H bond activation, particularly over redox-active metal oxides, highlights its potential as a mild oxidant that prevents over-oxidation. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with enhanced CO2 activation capabilities, aiming to lower the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. This could involve the design of bifunctional catalysts that simultaneously activate CO2 and dehydrogenate alkanes, potentially improving the overall efficiency of the process. Additionally, the investigation of novel redox-inactive catalysts that can effectively activate CO2 without leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation is a promising avenue. The exploration of CO2 activation mechanisms on various catalyst surfaces, including the role of oxygen vacancies, could provide insights into optimizing catalyst design for enhanced CO2 utilization. Moreover, the integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation with other processes, such as the reverse water gas shift reaction, could improve equilibrium conversion toward desired products, such as propylene. The development of catalysts that can synergistically activate CO2 and dehydrogenate alkanes, while maintaining high stability and selectivity, is a critical step toward sustainable chemical production.
