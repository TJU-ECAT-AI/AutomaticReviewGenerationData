The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, is a critical process for the production of light olefins, with CO2 emerging as an alternative and milder oxidant compared to traditional oxidants like O2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. In this context, metal oxide catalysts play a pivotal role in C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration, with distinct mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive catalysts \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, where lattice oxygen is donated to the alkane, forming alkenes and water, with CO2 refilling the oxygen vacancies to regenerate the catalyst \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. This process is characterized by the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which is filled by CO2, acting as a mild oxidant that avoids over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst demonstrates high activity for C3 and C4 alkane dehydrogenation, highlighting its effectiveness in CO2 activation for this process \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates the alkane but can lead to cracking and coke formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. These catalysts directly reduce the oxidant without forming an oxygen vacancy, which can result in less controlled reactions and catalyst deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are effective for CO2 activation due to their redox properties and oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional catalyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and *O, which effects dehydrogenation of the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, enhanced by CO2, eliminates hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, improving equilibrium conversion toward propylene production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by RWGS \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding the mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, and oxidant utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly with CO2 as an alternative oxidant, open up new avenues for catalyst design and process optimization. Future research endeavors might focus on developing bifunctional catalysts that can efficiently dissociate CO2 into CO and *O, enhancing the selectivity and activity for alkane dehydrogenation. The exploration of novel redox-inactive catalysts that can mitigate cracking and coke formation while maintaining high activity for CO2 activation is also a promising direction. Additionally, the integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation processes could contribute to the development of sustainable chemical production routes, aligning with the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and utilizing CO2 as a feedstock.

In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 acts as an oxidant, regenerating redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 and V2O5 by maintaining their higher oxidation states \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active catalysts such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 employ the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, donating oxygen to the alkane to form alkenes and water, with CO2 regenerating the catalyst by refilling lattice oxygen vacancies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates alkanes, but can lead to cracking and catalyst deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Effective CO2 activation for propane dehydrogenation is observed in V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters, with mechanisms involving CO2 activation by the catalyst to form CO and *O \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active catalysts typically having lower barriers \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature highlights the effectiveness of redox-active metal oxide catalysts, particularly V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as an oxidant. These catalysts maintain higher oxidation states and regenerate through CO2 reduction, making them promising for industrial applications. Redox-inactive catalysts, while less effective, offer alternative pathways for CO2 activation. Future research might focus on enhancing the CO2 activation efficiency of redox-inactive catalysts, exploring the role of transition metal clusters in CO2 dissociation, and developing bifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously activate CO2 and dehydrogenate alkanes. Additionally, understanding the detailed mechanisms of CO2 dissociation on various catalysts could lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
