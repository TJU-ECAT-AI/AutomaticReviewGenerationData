The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, is a critical process for the production of propylene, a vital petrochemical feedstock. This process is significantly influenced by the choice of catalyst and the oxidant used. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, activate C-H bonds via the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, donating oxygen to form alkenes and water, and regenerate through CO2 reduction \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 heterolytically into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates alkanes, but can induce cracking and coke formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 risk over-oxidation, whereas CO2, a milder oxidant, avoids this issue \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Among catalysts, V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 are highly active due to redox properties and oxygen mobility, while transition metal clusters like Mo2C are also effective \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2 dissociation mechanisms involve CO2 activation by the catalyst, forming CO and *O, with energy barriers influenced by the catalyst's redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

                In oxidative dehydrogenation, CO2 maintains higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, acting as an oxidant to regenerate redox-active metal oxide catalysts like V2O5 \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. The oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst shows high activity for C3 and C4 alkane dehydrogenation, highlighting its effectiveness \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Detailed mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration, especially for redox-inactive catalysts, are not well-documented \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].

                Redox-active metal oxides activate C-H bonds via the MvK mechanism, forming water and leaving an oxygen vacancy that requires an oxidant for regeneration. Redox-inactive oxides directly reduce the oxidant without needing a vacancy \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. CO2 as an oxidant can either dissociate directly or be hydrogenated before CO formation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Catalysts vary in effectiveness: V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation, VOx/SiO2 has a lower but still significant barrier, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters show easier CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

                CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, partially oxidizing redox-active metal oxide catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, facilitating C-H bond activation and propylene production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. This contrasts with redox-inactive catalysts such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, which have higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, making CO2 activation less effective \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2's role in suppressing surface carbon formation enhances catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Among catalysts, V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are more effective in utilizing CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

                DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane as the rate-limiting step \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The reverse water gas shift reaction, coupled with dehydrogenation, improves equilibrium conversion toward propylene production \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. However, the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains unclear \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel catalysts that can efficiently activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, while minimizing the formation of by-products such as CO and CO2. The design of bifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously activate CO2 and dehydrogenate alkanes is a promising direction. Additionally, the investigation of the role of CO2 in the regeneration of redox-inactive catalysts could lead to the discovery of new mechanisms and pathways for alkane dehydrogenation. The optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, to enhance the selectivity and yield of propylene is also a critical area of research. Furthermore, the integration of in situ spectroscopic techniques with computational methods could provide deeper insights into the catalytic mechanisms and the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a pivotal process in the petrochemical industry, is significantly influenced by the choice of catalyst and the nature of the oxidant, with CO2 emerging as a promising alternative to traditional oxidants like O2 \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, employ the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism for C-H bond activation, donating oxygen to the alkane to form an alkene and water, with CO2 regenerating the catalyst by refilling lattice oxygen vacancies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane, but can lead to cracking and coke formation, deactivating the catalyst \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize, whereas CO2 is milder and prevents over-oxidation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters are effective for CO2 activation due to their redox properties and oxygen mobility, facilitating CO2 dissociation with varying energy barriers \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 oxidation, VOx/SiO2 has a lower but still significant barrier, while CeO2 facilitates easier CO2 dissociation due to oxygen vacancies \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Transition metal clusters are also active for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\].

The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 suppresses surface carbon formation, enhancing catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The utilization of CO2 as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach, particularly when considering the global efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions. The effectiveness of redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, in utilizing CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides, highlights the potential for developing catalysts with enhanced CO2 activation capabilities \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Future research endeavors might focus on the design of bifunctional catalysts that can efficiently dissociate CO2 into CO and *O, which dehydrogenates alkanes, while minimizing cracking and coke formation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The exploration of novel catalysts with lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, could lead to more efficient and selective oxidative dehydrogenation processes \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12\]. Additionally, the integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation with other CO2 conversion technologies, such as the reverse water gas shift reaction, could enhance the overall efficiency and sustainability of the process \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
