{"DOC": "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, leading to the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms.\n\n          In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions. The CO2 is dissociated into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water.

The drastically different product distributions observed in the h-BN and metal oxide-based catalysts imply that the reaction mechanisms are different in these two types of catalysts. Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step.

{"DOC": "In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the C-H bond activation mechanism differs between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active oxides, the MvK mechanism is commonly observed, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen atom forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. For redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly, without the need for an oxygen vacancy. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are two proposed mechanisms: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. On a V2O5 catalyst, the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. On a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, the barrier for CO2 to reoxidize the site is 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy.

{"DOC": "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, involves the activation of C-H bonds through a redox mechanism. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen, can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation. In contrast, CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. The DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.\n          Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate C-H bonds in alkanes through a redox mechanism, where the metal oxide is reduced during the reaction and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially re-oxidize the catalyst to V2O4, which is less oxidizing than V2O5, thus reducing the probability of total oxidation of propane. Redox-inactive metal oxides, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through a different mechanism, possibly involving the dissociation of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced during the dehydrogenation step and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2. In the case of CO2, it can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This re-oxidation step is crucial for the regeneration of the catalyst's active sites. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not undergo such redox cycles and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration. CO2 can play a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been shown to be effective in utilizing CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides. However, the mechanism and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are not fully understood. CeO2 and transition metal clusters may have different mechanisms for CO2 activation, potentially involving the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which can eliminate hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The coupling of the RWGS reaction with dehydrogenation can improve the equilibrium conversion toward propylene production. However, the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by the RWGS reaction. The RWGS cycle is limited by hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen. Overall, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via both ODH and DH followed by RWGS.\n          In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene. When D2, C3H8, and CO2 are present in the feed at a ratio of 1:1:1, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, indicating that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane, accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction and non-oxidative dehydrogenation route.

However, the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation over vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood. DFT calculations have shown that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step for both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by the RWGS reaction. The RWGS cycle is limited by hydrogen migration from the vanadium site to the vicinal bridge oxygen. Overall, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via both ODH and DH followed by RWGS.\n          In the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the conversion of propane to propylene. When D2, C3H8, and CO2 are present in the feed at a ratio of 1:1:1, only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O, indicating that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane, accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction and non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. According to DFT calculations, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale.\n          Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the redox mechanism, where CO2 oxidizes the catalyst from V2O3 to V2O4. Redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may not be as effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their inability to undergo redox reactions. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts are higher, making the activation of CO2 less favorable.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015"}
