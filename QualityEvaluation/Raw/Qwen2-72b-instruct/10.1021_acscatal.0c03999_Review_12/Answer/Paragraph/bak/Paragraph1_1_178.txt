                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize the alkane, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, while CeO2 is effective due to its high oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, like Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with energy barriers for CO2 dissociation depending on the catalyst \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-active catalysts can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2, while redox-inactive catalysts rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 plays a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse
