                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize alkanes, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, while CeO2 is effective due to its high oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, with the rate-limiting step being the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, whereas redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 can play a role in suppressing the formation of
