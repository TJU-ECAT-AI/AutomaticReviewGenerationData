                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, like O2, can over-oxidize alkanes to CO2, whereas CO2 acts as a milder oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and facilitating alkene production \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters are also effective due to their oxygen mobility and reactivity \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and *O, with energy barriers varying depending on the catalyst's redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-active catalysts, like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced during dehydrogenation and then re-oxidized by CO2, which is crucial for catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not undergo redox cycles and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.20
