                    The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation, whereas CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts involve the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, which is the rate-limiting step, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
