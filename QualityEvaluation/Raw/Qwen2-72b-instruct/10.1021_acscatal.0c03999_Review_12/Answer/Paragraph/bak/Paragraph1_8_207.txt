                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\], and transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are highly active for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2 plays a significant role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane being the rate-limiting step \[10.1016/j.jcat.201
