                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, prevents over-oxidation and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective due to its oxygen mobility, and transition metal clusters, like Mo2C, are active due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower on redox-active metal oxides due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature highlights the pivotal role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the context of redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are known for their ability to activate CO2 through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and facilitating the regeneration of the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, which can lead to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, affecting catalyst stability.
