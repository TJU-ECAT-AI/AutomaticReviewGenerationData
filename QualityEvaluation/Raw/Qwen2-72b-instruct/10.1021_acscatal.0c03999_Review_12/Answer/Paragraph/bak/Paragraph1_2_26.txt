                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, allowing for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can lead to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, resulting in catalyst deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation, but are prone to over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 rather than the desired alkene \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that does not over-oxidize the alkane and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to produce the alkene and CO \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[
