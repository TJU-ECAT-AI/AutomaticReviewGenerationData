                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy, facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. However, CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
