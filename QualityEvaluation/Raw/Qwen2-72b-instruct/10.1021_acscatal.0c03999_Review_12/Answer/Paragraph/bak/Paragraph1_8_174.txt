                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, like molecular oxygen (O2), can over-oxidize alkanes, leading to the formation of CO2 instead of the desired alkene. CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize the alkane and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to produce the alkene and CO \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation over these catalysts involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s415
