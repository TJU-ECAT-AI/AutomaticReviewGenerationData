                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can over-oxidize alkanes to CO2, whereas CO2 acts as a milder oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and facilitating alkene production \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters are less effective due to higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and *O \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-active metal oxides, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through the redox mechanism, where CO2 oxidizes the catalyst from V2O3 to V2O4, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like CeO2 and transition metal clusters, may not be as effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their inability to undergo redox reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
