                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, allowing for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation. However, O2 is prone to over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 rather than the desired alkene. CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The DFT calculations confirm that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].
