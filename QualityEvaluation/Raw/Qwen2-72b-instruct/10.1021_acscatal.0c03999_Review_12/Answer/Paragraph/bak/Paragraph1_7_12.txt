                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize the alkane, while CO2, as a milder oxidant, avoids this issue \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters, like Mo2C, are also effective \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower on redox-active metal oxides due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, can undergo redox cycles, where the metal oxide is reduced during the dehydrogenation step and then re-oxidized by traditional oxidants like O2 or CO2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and this re-oxidation step is crucial for the regeneration of the catalyst's active sites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Redox-inactive catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, do not undergo such redox cycles and rely on other mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12
