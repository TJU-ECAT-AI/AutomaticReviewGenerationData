                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, allowing for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can lead to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, resulting in catalyst deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can also be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, but they are prone to over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 rather than the desired alkene. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that does not over-oxidize the alkane and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to produce the alkene and CO \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation over these catalysts involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O). The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox
