                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective due to its high oxygen mobility, and transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are effective due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and *O \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. However, the stability and selectivity of the catalysts also play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].
