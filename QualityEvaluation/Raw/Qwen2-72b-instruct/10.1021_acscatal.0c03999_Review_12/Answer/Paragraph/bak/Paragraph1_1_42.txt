                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize alkanes, while CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters are less effective due to higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and *O \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The exploration of CO2 as an alternative oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions presents a promising avenue for sustainable chemical processes. Redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, have shown high effectiveness in activating CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, due to their ability to undergo redox cycles and facilitate the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters exhibit higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, making CO2 activation less favorable. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with enhanced redox properties and lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, potentially through the design of hybrid catalysts that combine the advantages of redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxides.
