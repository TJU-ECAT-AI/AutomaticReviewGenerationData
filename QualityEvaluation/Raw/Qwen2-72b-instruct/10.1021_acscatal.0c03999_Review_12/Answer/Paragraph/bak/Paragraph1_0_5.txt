                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes to CO2, whereas CO2 acts as a milder oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and facilitating alkene production \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, while CeO2 and transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective due to their oxygen mobility and reactivity \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are lower on redox-active metal oxides due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].
                
                The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation is multifaceted. It can maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species during the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, acting as an oxidant to regenerate the catalysts \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\]. CO2 can also oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and suppress the formation of surface carbon, which is beneficial for catalyst stability and activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO
