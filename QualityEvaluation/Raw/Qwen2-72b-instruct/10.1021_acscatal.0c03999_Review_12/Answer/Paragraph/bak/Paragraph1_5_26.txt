                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes to CO2, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, while CeO2 is effective due to its oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing higher activity due to their ability to undergo redox cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and *O \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The stability and selectivity of the catalysts play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction \[10.103
