                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize alkanes, whereas CO2, as a milder oxidant, does not over-oxidize and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\], and transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are highly active for CO2 dissociation \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12\].

                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The literature highlights the pivotal role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the context of redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, are known for their ability to activate CO2 through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, whereas redox-inactive catalysts activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation. The use of CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages over traditional oxidants like O2, including the prevention of over-oxidation and the potential for improved selectivity and efficiency. Future research could focus on the development of novel catalysts that can more effectively activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with a particular emphasis on understanding and optimizing the
