                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, allowing for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions. The CO2 is dissociated into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, leading to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, resulting in catalyst deactivation \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state, enabling the continuous regeneration of the active site for further C-H bond activation. In contrast, CO2, as a mild oxidant, can partially oxidize the catalyst, as seen with the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4, which is less effective in fully regenerating the catalyst but still participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation process \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The role of CO2 in suppressing the formation of surface carbon is significant, as it helps maintain the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as CeO2 and transition metal clusters, the activation of CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is less effective due to the higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox
