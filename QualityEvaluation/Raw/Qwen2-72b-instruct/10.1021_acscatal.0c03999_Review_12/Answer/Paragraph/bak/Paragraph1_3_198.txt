                The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, forming the corresponding alkene and water, and is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2 \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, like Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which dehydrogenates the alkane \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can over-oxidize alkanes to CO2, whereas CO2 acts as a milder oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and facilitating alkene production \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 being highly active due to their redox properties, allowing for facile oxygen atom transfer \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. CeO2 is also effective due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are highly active for CO2 dissociation due to their high reactivity and redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\]. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers due to their redox properties \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\].
                
                The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation is significant, as it can maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species during the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, acting as an oxidant to regenerate the catalysts \[10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2\].
