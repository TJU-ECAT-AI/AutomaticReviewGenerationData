In metal oxides, the activation of the C-H bond in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can occur homolytically through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water that desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides such as MgO and La2O3 do not require the formation of a vacancy. Instead, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two mechanisms are proposed: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. On the CeO2 (110) surface, CO2 dissociation occurs with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV on Ni4/MgO, which provides active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation.

在金属氧化物中，烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的氢原子抽提发生，或者在酸碱对上异裂发生。在氧化还原活性氧化物中，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基中抽提第二个氢，形成水并脱附，留下氧空位。这个空位必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。相比之下，在MgO和La2O3等氧化还原非活性氧化物中，不需要形成空位。相反，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，提出了两种机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，或者CO2氢化形成HOCO或COOH，然后再形成CO。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的有效性各不相同。在CeO2 (110)表面上，CO2分解在含有氧空位的位点上具有1.36 eV的速率限制势垒。过渡金属，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，已被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性，在Ni4/MgO上具有0.35 eV的低势垒，为烷烃C-H活化提供了活性氧物种。
