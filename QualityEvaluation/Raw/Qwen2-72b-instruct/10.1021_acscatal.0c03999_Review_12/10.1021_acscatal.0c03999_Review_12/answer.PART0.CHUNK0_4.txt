In oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the C-H bond activation mechanism differs between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active oxides, the MvK mechanism is commonly observed, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen atom forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. For redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly, without the need for an oxygen vacancy. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are two proposed mechanisms: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. On a V2O5 catalyst, the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. On a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, the barrier for CO2 to reoxidize the site is 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，C-H键活化机制在氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于氧化还原活性氧化物，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧原子上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基基团中抽象出第二个氢，形成水，水脱附并留下一个氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。对于氧化还原非活性氧化物，如MgO和La2O3，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原，无需氧空位。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，有两种提出的机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，或CO2氢化形成HOCO或COOH，然后形成CO。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性各不相同。在V2O5催化剂上，CO2氧化VIII位点的能垒为3.16 eV，反应能量为吸热2.21 eV，表明过程极其困难。在VOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2重新氧化位点的能垒为1.76 eV，比纯V2O5表面低，但能量仍然显著。相比之下，CO2分解在CeO2 (110)表面更容易发生，含有氧空位的位点的速率限制能垒为1.36 eV。过渡金属，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，也被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性。
