[1] "In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acidbase pair."
[2] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group."
[3] "This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."
[4] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly."
[5] "This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."
[6] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."
[7] "For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface."
[8] "Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for ODHP with CO2."
[9] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst."
[10] "They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."
[11] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."
[12] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."
[13] "Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation."
[14] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."

1.In metal oxides, the activation of the C-H bond in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can occur homolytically through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. For redox-active oxides, a common mechanism is the MvK mechanism, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen atom forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water that desorbs and leaves an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides such as MgO and La2O3 do not require the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Instead, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly.
2.When CO2 is used as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, two mechanisms are proposed: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The high stability of CO2 makes it difficult to activate for surface oxidation, necessitating a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters have been studied for their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 to oxidize the surface, making the process difficult. VOx/SiO2 has a lower barrier than V2O5 but still significant. CeO2 (110) surface has a lower rate-limiting barrier for CO2 dissociation on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metal clusters, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV on Ni4/MgO, providing active oxygen species for alkane CH activation.

1.在金属氧化物中，烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的氢原子抽提以同裂方式发生，或在酸碱对上以异裂方式发生。对于氧化还原活性氧化物，常见的机制是MvK机制，其中吸附在氧原子上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基基团中抽提第二个氢，形成水，水脱附并留下氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。相比之下，氧化还原非活性氧化物如MgO和La2O3不需要形成氧空位。相反，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原。
2.当CO2用作氧化脱氢烷烃反应的氧化剂时，提出了两种机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，以及在形成CO之前将CO2氢化为HOCO或COOH。CO2的高稳定性使其难以激活进行表面氧化，因此需要具有对CO2及其分解有强亲和力的催化剂。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇已被研究用于它们在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性。V2O5的CO2氧化表面的屏障很高，使得过程变得困难。VOx/SiO2的屏障低于V2O5，但仍然显著。CeO2(110)表面在含有氧空位的位点上CO2分解的速率限制屏障较低。过渡金属簇，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，已被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性，Ni4/MgO上的CO2分解屏障低至0.35 eV，为烷烃CH活化提供了活性氧物种。
