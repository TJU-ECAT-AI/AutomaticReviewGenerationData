In metal oxides, the activation of the C-H bond in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can occur homolytically through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. For redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is typically observed, where hydrogen adsorbed on oxygen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water that desorbs and leaves an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides such as MgO and La2O3 do not require the formation of a vacancy. Instead, the catalyst surface brings hydrogen and the oxidant together, with the oxidant being reduced directly. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two mechanisms are proposed: direct dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. On the CeO2 (110) surface, CO2 dissociation occurs with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV observed on Ni4/MgO, which provides active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation.

在金属氧化物中，烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的氢原子抽提或在酸碱对上发生均裂。对于具有氧化还原活性的氧化物，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基中抽提第二个氢，形成水后脱附，留下氧空位。这个空位必须通过氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。相比之下，对于MgO和La2O3等无氧化还原活性的氧化物，不需要形成空位。相反，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，提出了两种机制：直接分解形成CO和O，或先将CO2氢化为HOCO或COOH再形成CO。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的有效性各不相同。在CeO2 (110)表面上，CO2分解在含有氧空位的位点上具有1.36 eV的速率限制能垒。过渡金属，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，已被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性，Ni4/MgO上观察到0.35 eV的低能垒，为烷烃C-H活化提供了活性氧物种。
