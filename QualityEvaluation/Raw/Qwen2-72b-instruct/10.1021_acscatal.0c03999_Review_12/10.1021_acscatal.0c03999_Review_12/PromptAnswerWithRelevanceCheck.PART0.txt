In metal oxides, the activation of the C-H bond in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can occur homolytically through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. In redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water that desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides such as MgO and La2O3 do not require the formation of a vacancy. Instead, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two mechanisms are proposed: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, or hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. On the CeO2 (110) surface, CO2 dissociation occurs with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV on Ni4/MgO, which provides active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation.

在金属氧化物中，烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的氢原子抽提发生，或者在酸碱对上异裂发生。在氧化还原活性氧化物中，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基中抽提第二个氢，形成水并脱附，留下氧空位。这个空位必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。相比之下，在MgO和La2O3等氧化还原非活性氧化物中，不需要形成空位。相反，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，提出了两种机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，或者CO2氢化形成HOCO或COOH，然后再形成CO。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的有效性各不相同。在CeO2 (110)表面上，CO2分解在含有氧空位的位点上具有1.36 eV的速率限制势垒。过渡金属，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，已被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性，在Ni4/MgO上具有0.35 eV的低势垒，为烷烃C-H活化提供了活性氧物种。

1.In metal oxides, the activation of the C-H bond in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can occur homolytically through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid-base pair. For redox-active oxides, a common mechanism is the MvK mechanism, where hydrogen adsorbed on an oxygen atom forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen from a C-H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group, forming water that desorbs and leaves an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. In contrast, redox-inactive oxides such as MgO and La2O3 do not require the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Instead, the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly.
2.When CO2 is used as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, two mechanisms are proposed: direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. The high stability of CO2 makes it difficult to activate for surface oxidation, necessitating a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation. V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters have been studied for their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 has a high barrier for CO2 to oxidize the surface, making the process difficult. VOx/SiO2 has a lower barrier than V2O5 but still significant. CeO2 (110) surface has a lower rate-limiting barrier for CO2 dissociation on a site containing oxygen vacancies. Transition metal clusters, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV on Ni4/MgO, providing active oxygen species for alkane CH activation.

1.在金属氧化物中，烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键的活化通常通过表面氧物种的氢原子抽提以同裂方式发生，或在酸碱对上以异裂方式发生。对于氧化还原活性氧化物，常见的机制是MvK机制，其中吸附在氧原子上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基基团中抽提第二个氢，形成水，水脱附并留下氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。相比之下，氧化还原非活性氧化物如MgO和La2O3不需要形成氧空位。相反，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原。
2.当CO2用作氧化脱氢烷烃反应的氧化剂时，提出了两种机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，以及在形成CO之前将CO2氢化为HOCO或COOH。CO2的高稳定性使其难以激活进行表面氧化，因此需要具有对CO2及其分解有强亲和力的催化剂。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇已被研究用于它们在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性。V2O5的CO2氧化表面的屏障很高，使得过程变得困难。VOx/SiO2的屏障低于V2O5，但仍然显著。CeO2(110)表面在含有氧空位的位点上CO2分解的速率限制屏障较低。过渡金属簇，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，已被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性，Ni4/MgO上的CO2分解屏障低至0.35 eV，为烷烃CH活化提供了活性氧物种。

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，C-H键活化机制在氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于氧化还原活性氧化物，通常观察到MvK机制，其中吸附在氧原子上的氢形成羟基，并从C-H键或邻近的羟基基团中抽象出第二个氢，形成水，水脱附并留下一个氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。对于氧化还原非活性氧化物，如MgO和La2O3，催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂被直接还原，无需氧空位。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，有两种提出的机制：直接CO2分解形成CO和O，或CO2氢化形成HOCO或COOH，然后形成CO。不同催化剂在激活CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性各不相同。在V2O5催化剂上，CO2氧化VIII位点的能垒为3.16 eV，反应能量为吸热2.21 eV，表明过程极其困难。在VOx/SiO2催化剂上，CO2重新氧化位点的能垒为1.76 eV，比纯V2O5表面低，但能量仍然显著。相比之下，CO2分解在CeO2 (110)表面更容易发生，含有氧空位的位点的速率限制能垒为1.36 eV。过渡金属，特别是以亚纳米簇的形式，也被发现对CO2分解具有高度活性。
