1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as Cr oxides, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy, completing the redox cycle. This process is effective for activating CO2 and dehydrogenating alkanes due to the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the transfer of oxygen atoms.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga oxides, operate through a two-step mechanism. The alkane is first dehydrogenated to the alkene and hydrogen, followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, in which hydrogen combines with CO2 to form CO and water. The Ga2O3/MxOy catalysts are effective for CO2 activation but bind alkanes at acidic sites that can induce cracking reactions, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. This is because the acidic sites on the catalyst surface can promote the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds in the alkane, resulting in the formation of coke and deactivation of the catalyst.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, resulting in the formation of undesired products and catalyst deactivation. CO2, on the other hand, is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over-oxidation and does not form an explosive reactive mixture. The introduction of CO2 alters the pathway of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction by providing an oxygen atom that combines with the hydrogen atoms from the alkane to form water, lowering the free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction and making it feasible at lower operating temperatures.

4. Different catalysts have been investigated for their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been found to be effective for CO2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The V2O5 catalysts operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the vanadium oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the alkene and water. The vanadium center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. The VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been found to be more selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 compared to other supports, due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures.

5. CeO2 has also been investigated as a support for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. CeO2 has high oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, which can improve alkene selectivity by increasing the participation of oxygen atoms from the support. Mixed-oxide supports have been found to have improved activity compared to single oxides due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. However, acidic supports can only interact weakly with V2O5, leading to the formation of poorly dispersed crystallites and low alkene yield.

6. Transition metal clusters, such as Ni3Pt1/CeO2, have been found to be effective for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The bimetallic catalysts feature metallic Ni or FeNi alloys that can activate CO2 and dehydrogenate propane to propene with high selectivity. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst has been found to be a highly active dry reforming catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, has been found to favor oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with high C3H6 selectivity and good stability.

1. 活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Cr氧化物，通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行烷烃的氧化脱氢。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成相应的烯烃和水。金属中心然后通过CO2被重新氧化，填补晶格氧空位，完成氧化还原循环。由于金属氧化物的氧化还原活性，允许氧原子的转移，这一过程对于激活CO2和脱氢烷烃是有效的。

2. 相反，非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga氧化物，通过两步机制运行。首先，烷烃被脱氢为烯烃和氢气，然后是逆向水煤气转换（RWGS）反应，其中氢气与CO2结合形成CO和水。Ga2O3/MxOy催化剂对CO2激活有效，但在酸性位点结合烷烃，可诱导裂解反应，导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。这是因为催化剂表面的酸性位点可以促进烷烃中碳-碳键的断裂，导致焦炭的形成和催化剂的失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如分子氧（O2），可能导致过度氧化和烷烃的裂解，形成不希望的产物和催化剂失活。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不易过度氧化，不会形成爆炸性反应混合物。CO2的引入通过提供一个氧原子与烷烃中的氢原子结合形成水，改变了氧化脱氢反应的途径，降低了反应的自由能变化（ΔG），使反应在较低的操作温度下可行。

4. 不同的催化剂已被研究，以评估它们在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性。V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂被发现对CO2激活和丙烷氧化脱氢有效。V2O5催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中钒氧化物向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成烯烃和水。然后，钒中心通过CO2被重新氧化，完成氧化还原循环。VOx/SiO2催化剂被发现与其它支持物相比，在CO2存在下对丙烷氧化脱氢具有更高的选择性，这是由于活性VOx表面结构的稳定化。

5. CeO2也被研究作为丙烷氧化脱氢中CO2激活的支持物。CeO2具有高氧流动性和空位浓度，可以通过增加来自支持物的氧原子的参与来提高烯烃选择性。混合氧化物支持物与单一氧化物相比，由于具有更大的酸碱双功能，显示出改善的活性。然而，酸性支持物只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致形成分散不良的结晶体和低烯烃产量。

6. 过渡金属簇，如Ni3Pt1/CeO2，被发现对CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢有效。双金属催化剂具有金属Ni或FeNi合金，可以激活CO2并将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，具有高选择性。Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂被发现是一种高活性干重整催化剂，对CO的选择性为96%。另一方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂被发现有利于丙烷的氧化脱氢，具有高C3H6选择性和良好的稳定性。
