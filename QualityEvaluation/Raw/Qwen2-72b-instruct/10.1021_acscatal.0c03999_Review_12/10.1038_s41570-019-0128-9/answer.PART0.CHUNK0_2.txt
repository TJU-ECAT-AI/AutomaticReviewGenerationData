1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as Cr oxides and V oxides, involves a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy, completing the redox cycle. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the transfer of oxygen atoms. However, these catalysts often suffer from rapid deactivation due to coking and sintering.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga oxides, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, forming a reactive oxygen species (*O). This *O species then effects the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can induce cracking reactions, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, resulting in the formation of CO2 and H2O. This can lead to a decrease in selectivity for the desired alkene product. CO2, on the other hand, is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over-oxidation and does not form an explosive reactive mixture. It can selectively effect the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and CO.

4. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been shown to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. V2O5 operates through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. VOx/SiO2 catalysts, on the other hand, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, forming a reactive oxygen species (*O) that effects the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane.

5. CeO2 has been shown to be effective for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. CeO2 can readily donate an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. CeO2 also has high oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, which improves alkene selectivity.

6. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, have been shown to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Mo2C operates through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. Mo2C also has high affinity for adsorbing atomic oxygen, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 在Cr氧化物和V氧化物等还原活性金属氧化物催化剂上，烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及Mars-van Krevelen机制。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，填补晶格氧空位，完成氧化还原循环。这个过程由金属氧化物的还原活性促进，允许氧原子的转移。然而，这些催化剂通常由于焦化和烧结而迅速失活。

2. 相比之下，还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga氧化物，通过异裂解离活化CO2，形成活性氧物种(*O)。这个*O物种然后影响吸附烷烃的脱氢，形成相应的烯烃和水。然而，这些催化剂在酸性位点结合烷烃，这可能引发裂解反应，导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如O2，可能导致过度氧化和烷烃裂解，形成CO2和H2O。这可能导致所需烯烃产物的选择性降低。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不容易过度氧化，不会形成爆炸性反应混合物。它可以有选择性地影响烷烃的氧化脱氢，形成相应的烯烃和CO。

4. V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂已被证明在CO2存在下对丙烷的氧化脱氢有效。V2O5通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中金属氧化物将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。另一方面，VOx/SiO2催化剂通过异裂解离活化CO2，形成活性氧物种(*O)，影响吸附烷烃的脱氢。

5. CeO2已被证明对丙烷氧化脱氢中CO2的活化有效。CeO2可以轻易地将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。CeO2还具有高氧流动性和空位浓度，这提高了烯烃的选择性。

6. 过渡金属簇，如Mo2C，已被证明在CO2存在下对丙烷的氧化脱氢有效。Mo2C通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中金属氧化物将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。Mo2C还具有高亲和力吸附原子氧，这促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。
