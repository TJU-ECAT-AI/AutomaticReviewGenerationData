1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, leading to the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions. The CO2 is dissociated into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can lead to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can also be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, O2 is prone to over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 rather than the desired alkene. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that does not over-oxidize the alkane and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to produce the alkene and CO.

4. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox properties.

5. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation over these catalysts involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O). The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers due to their redox properties. However, the stability and selectivity of the catalysts also play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

1. 红氧化金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，在氧化脱氢烷烃反应中通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后催化剂通过CO2的还原再生，CO2提供了填充晶格氧空位所需的氧原子。这一过程由金属氧化物的氧化还原活性促进，允许氧原子的轻松转移。

2. 相比之下，非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga2O3/MxOy，通过异裂解离而不是氧化还原反应激活CO2。CO2被异裂解离为CO和活性氧物种(*O)，然后脱氢烷烃形成相应的烯烃和水。然而，这些催化剂在酸性位点结合烷烃，这可能导致裂解反应和焦炭的形成，导致催化剂失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如分子氧(O2)，也可以用于氧化脱氢反应。然而，O2容易过度氧化，形成CO2而不是所需的烯烃。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不会过度氧化烷烃，可以与烷烃脱氢一起使用，产生烯烃和CO。

4. 不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的有效性各不相同。V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其氧化还原性质，对CO2激活非常有效，允许氧原子的轻松转移。CeO2由于其高氧流动性，能够释放和回收氧原子，因此对CO2激活也很有效。过渡金属簇，如Mo2C，由于其高反应性和氧化还原性质，对CO2激活也很有效。

5. 这些催化剂上CO2解离的建议机制涉及金属氧化物或过渡金属簇对CO2的激活，形成CO和活性氧物种(*O)。CO2解离的能量势垒根据催化剂的不同而变化，氧化还原活性金属氧化物通常由于其氧化还原性质而具有较低的势垒。然而，催化剂的稳定性和选择性也在氧化脱氢反应的整体有效性中起着关键作用。

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as Cr oxides, proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy, completing the redox cycle. This process is effective for activating CO2 and dehydrogenating alkanes due to the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the transfer of oxygen atoms.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga oxides, operate through a two-step mechanism. The alkane is first dehydrogenated to the alkene and hydrogen, followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, in which hydrogen combines with CO2 to form CO and water. The Ga2O3/MxOy catalysts are effective for CO2 activation but bind alkanes at acidic sites that can induce cracking reactions, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. This is because the acidic sites on the catalyst surface can promote the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds in the alkane, resulting in the formation of coke and deactivation of the catalyst.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, resulting in the formation of undesired products and catalyst deactivation. CO2, on the other hand, is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over-oxidation and does not form an explosive reactive mixture. The introduction of CO2 alters the pathway of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction by providing an oxygen atom that combines with the hydrogen atoms from the alkane to form water, lowering the free energy change (ΔG) for the reaction and making it feasible at lower operating temperatures.

4. Different catalysts have been investigated for their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been found to be effective for CO2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The V2O5 catalysts operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the vanadium oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the alkene and water. The vanadium center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. The VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been found to be more selective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 compared to other supports, due to the stabilization of active VOx surface structures.

5. CeO2 has also been investigated as a support for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. CeO2 has high oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, which can improve alkene selectivity by increasing the participation of oxygen atoms from the support. Mixed-oxide supports have been found to have improved activity compared to single oxides due to greater acid-base bifunctionality. However, acidic supports can only interact weakly with V2O5, leading to the formation of poorly dispersed crystallites and low alkene yield.

6. Transition metal clusters, such as Ni3Pt1/CeO2, have been found to be effective for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The bimetallic catalysts feature metallic Ni or FeNi alloys that can activate CO2 and dehydrogenate propane to propene with high selectivity. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst has been found to be a highly active dry reforming catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, has been found to favor oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with high C3H6 selectivity and good stability.

1. 活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Cr氧化物，通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行烷烃的氧化脱氢。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成相应的烯烃和水。金属中心然后通过CO2被重新氧化，填补晶格氧空位，完成氧化还原循环。由于金属氧化物的氧化还原活性，允许氧原子的转移，这一过程对于激活CO2和脱氢烷烃是有效的。

2. 相反，非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga氧化物，通过两步机制运行。首先，烷烃被脱氢为烯烃和氢气，然后是逆向水煤气转换（RWGS）反应，其中氢气与CO2结合形成CO和水。Ga2O3/MxOy催化剂对CO2激活有效，但在酸性位点结合烷烃，可诱导裂解反应，导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。这是因为催化剂表面的酸性位点可以促进烷烃中碳-碳键的断裂，导致焦炭的形成和催化剂的失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如分子氧（O2），可能导致过度氧化和烷烃的裂解，形成不希望的产物和催化剂失活。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不易过度氧化，不会形成爆炸性反应混合物。CO2的引入通过提供一个氧原子与烷烃中的氢原子结合形成水，改变了氧化脱氢反应的途径，降低了反应的自由能变化（ΔG），使反应在较低的操作温度下可行。

4. 不同的催化剂已被研究，以评估它们在丙烷氧化脱氢中激活CO2的有效性。V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂被发现对CO2激活和丙烷氧化脱氢有效。V2O5催化剂通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中钒氧化物向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成烯烃和水。然后，钒中心通过CO2被重新氧化，完成氧化还原循环。VOx/SiO2催化剂被发现与其它支持物相比，在CO2存在下对丙烷氧化脱氢具有更高的选择性，这是由于活性VOx表面结构的稳定化。

5. CeO2也被研究作为丙烷氧化脱氢中CO2激活的支持物。CeO2具有高氧流动性和空位浓度，可以通过增加来自支持物的氧原子的参与来提高烯烃选择性。混合氧化物支持物与单一氧化物相比，由于具有更大的酸碱双功能，显示出改善的活性。然而，酸性支持物只能与V2O5弱相互作用，导致形成分散不良的结晶体和低烯烃产量。

6. 过渡金属簇，如Ni3Pt1/CeO2，被发现对CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢有效。双金属催化剂具有金属Ni或FeNi合金，可以激活CO2并将丙烷脱氢为丙烯，具有高选择性。Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂被发现是一种高活性干重整催化剂，对CO的选择性为96%。另一方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂被发现有利于丙烷的氧化脱氢，具有高C3H6选择性和良好的稳定性。

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as Cr oxides and V oxides, involves a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy, completing the redox cycle. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the transfer of oxygen atoms. However, these catalysts often suffer from rapid deactivation due to coking and sintering.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga oxides, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, forming a reactive oxygen species (*O). This *O species then effects the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can induce cracking reactions, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as O2, can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, resulting in the formation of CO2 and H2O. This can lead to a decrease in selectivity for the desired alkene product. CO2, on the other hand, is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over-oxidation and does not form an explosive reactive mixture. It can selectively effect the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and CO.

4. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts have been shown to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. V2O5 operates through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. VOx/SiO2 catalysts, on the other hand, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation, forming a reactive oxygen species (*O) that effects the dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane.

5. CeO2 has been shown to be effective for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. CeO2 can readily donate an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. CeO2 also has high oxygen mobility and vacancy concentration, which improves alkene selectivity.

6. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, have been shown to be effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Mo2C operates through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, resulting in the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The metal center is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the redox cycle. Mo2C also has high affinity for adsorbing atomic oxygen, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 在Cr氧化物和V氧化物等还原活性金属氧化物催化剂上，烷烃的氧化脱氢涉及Mars-van Krevelen机制。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，填补晶格氧空位，完成氧化还原循环。这个过程由金属氧化物的还原活性促进，允许氧原子的转移。然而，这些催化剂通常由于焦化和烧结而迅速失活。

2. 相比之下，还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga氧化物，通过异裂解离活化CO2，形成活性氧物种(*O)。这个*O物种然后影响吸附烷烃的脱氢，形成相应的烯烃和水。然而，这些催化剂在酸性位点结合烷烃，这可能引发裂解反应，导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如O2，可能导致过度氧化和烷烃裂解，形成CO2和H2O。这可能导致所需烯烃产物的选择性降低。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不容易过度氧化，不会形成爆炸性反应混合物。它可以有选择性地影响烷烃的氧化脱氢，形成相应的烯烃和CO。

4. V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂已被证明在CO2存在下对丙烷的氧化脱氢有效。V2O5通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中金属氧化物将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。另一方面，VOx/SiO2催化剂通过异裂解离活化CO2，形成活性氧物种(*O)，影响吸附烷烃的脱氢。

5. CeO2已被证明对丙烷氧化脱氢中CO2的活化有效。CeO2可以轻易地将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。CeO2还具有高氧流动性和空位浓度，这提高了烯烃的选择性。

6. 过渡金属簇，如Mo2C，已被证明在CO2存在下对丙烷的氧化脱氢有效。Mo2C通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运行，其中金属氧化物将氧原子捐赠给烷烃，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后，金属中心通过CO2还原，完成氧化还原循环。Mo2C还具有高亲和力吸附原子氧，这促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the adsorbed alkane to produce the corresponding alkene and H2O. Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, while CO2 is a milder oxidant that selectively breaks C-H bonds without over-oxidizing the substrate. Redox-inactive metal oxides like Ga2O3/MxOy activate CO2 but bind alkanes at acidic sites, leading to cracking reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. Transition metal clusters like NiFeOx interfaces on CeO2 can selectively cleave C-H bonds over C-C bonds, promoting oxidative dehydrogenation over dry reforming.

2. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts can activate CO2 and undergo redox cycles to effect oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The VOx species can insert into C-H bonds to cleave them, while the support (SiO2) stabilizes the active VOx sites. CeO2 can also activate CO2 and promote oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over supported NiFeOx interfaces. The NiFeOx sites selectively cleave C-H bonds over C-C bonds, leading to high selectivity for propylene over CO. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation is lower over NiFeOx/CeO2 compared to V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, making it a promising catalyst for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 在氧化脱氢烷烃的反应中,氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂会将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种(*O),后者会脱氢吸附的烷烃,生成相应的烯烃和H2O。传统的氧化剂如O2会导致烷烃的过度氧化和裂解,而CO2是一种温和的氧化剂,可以有选择性地断裂C-H键,而不会过度氧化底物。像Ga2O3/MxOy这样的氧化还原非活性金属氧化物可以活化CO2,但会在酸性位点吸附烷烃,导致裂解反应形成焦炭并使催化剂失活。像NiFeOx/CeO2上的过渡金属簇可以有选择性地断裂C-H键而不是C-C键,从而促进氧化脱氢而不是干重整。

2. V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂可以活化CO2,并通过氧化还原循环实现丙烷的氧化脱氢。VOx物种可以插入C-H键中,断裂它们,而载体(SiO2)稳定了活性VOx位点。CeO2也可以活化CO2,并促进NiFeOx/CeO2界面支持的丙烷氧化脱氢。NiFeOx位点有选择性地断裂C-H键而不是C-C键,导致丙烯的选择性高于CO。NiFeOx/CeO2上CO2的解离能垒低于V2O5或VOx/SiO2,使其成为CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢的有希望的催化剂。

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes requires a bifunctional catalyst that can dissociate CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O. The *O species then dehydrogenates the adsorbed alkane, producing the corresponding alkene and H2O. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga2O3/MxOy activate CO2 but bind alkanes at acidic sites, leading to cracking reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize substrates and form explosive mixtures, while CO2 is a mild oxidant that does not prone to over-oxidation. Transition metal clusters like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2 into CO and *O, with the *O species dehydrogenating the alkane. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing lower barriers than CeO2.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢需要一种双功能催化剂，能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种*O。*O物种然后脱氢吸附的烷烃，产生相应的烯烃和H2O。相比之下，像Ga2O3/MxOy这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂可以激活CO2，但在酸性位点结合烷烃，导致形成焦炭和使催化剂失活的裂解反应。传统的氧化剂如O2可能会过度氧化底物并形成爆炸性混合物，而CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不容易过度氧化。过渡金属簇如V2O5，VOx/SiO2和CeO2可以激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。提出的机制涉及将CO2分解为CO和*O，*O物种脱氢烷烃。CO2分解的能量势垒根据催化剂的不同而变化，V2O5和VOx/SiO2的势垒低于CeO2。
