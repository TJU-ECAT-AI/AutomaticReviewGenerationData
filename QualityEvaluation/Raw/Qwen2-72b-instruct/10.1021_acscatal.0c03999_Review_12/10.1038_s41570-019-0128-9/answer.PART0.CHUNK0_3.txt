1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts involves the dissociation of CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O) that dehydrogenates the adsorbed alkane to produce the corresponding alkene and H2O. Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and cracking of the alkane, while CO2 is a milder oxidant that selectively breaks C-H bonds without over-oxidizing the substrate. Redox-inactive metal oxides like Ga2O3/MxOy activate CO2 but bind alkanes at acidic sites, leading to cracking reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. Transition metal clusters like NiFeOx interfaces on CeO2 can selectively cleave C-H bonds over C-C bonds, promoting oxidative dehydrogenation over dry reforming.

2. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts can activate CO2 and undergo redox cycles to effect oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The VOx species can insert into C-H bonds to cleave them, while the support (SiO2) stabilizes the active VOx sites. CeO2 can also activate CO2 and promote oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over supported NiFeOx interfaces. The NiFeOx sites selectively cleave C-H bonds over C-C bonds, leading to high selectivity for propylene over CO. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation is lower over NiFeOx/CeO2 compared to V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, making it a promising catalyst for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 在氧化脱氢烷烃的反应中,氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂会将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种(*O),后者会脱氢吸附的烷烃,生成相应的烯烃和H2O。传统的氧化剂如O2会导致烷烃的过度氧化和裂解,而CO2是一种温和的氧化剂,可以有选择性地断裂C-H键,而不会过度氧化底物。像Ga2O3/MxOy这样的氧化还原非活性金属氧化物可以活化CO2,但会在酸性位点吸附烷烃,导致裂解反应形成焦炭并使催化剂失活。像NiFeOx/CeO2上的过渡金属簇可以有选择性地断裂C-H键而不是C-C键,从而促进氧化脱氢而不是干重整。

2. V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂可以活化CO2,并通过氧化还原循环实现丙烷的氧化脱氢。VOx物种可以插入C-H键中,断裂它们,而载体(SiO2)稳定了活性VOx位点。CeO2也可以活化CO2,并促进NiFeOx/CeO2界面支持的丙烷氧化脱氢。NiFeOx位点有选择性地断裂C-H键而不是C-C键,导致丙烯的选择性高于CO。NiFeOx/CeO2上CO2的解离能垒低于V2O5或VOx/SiO2,使其成为CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢的有希望的催化剂。
