1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, typically proceeds through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, leading to the formation of the corresponding alkene and water. The catalyst is then regenerated by the reduction of CO2, which provides the oxygen atom needed to refill the lattice oxygen vacancy. This process is facilitated by the redox activity of the metal oxide, which allows for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms.

2. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/MxOy, activate CO2 through heterolytic dissociation rather than redox reactions. The CO2 is dissociated into CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O), which then dehydrogenates the alkane to the corresponding alkene and water. However, these catalysts bind alkanes at acidic sites, which can lead to cracking reactions and the formation of coke, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

3. Traditional oxidants, such as molecular oxygen (O2), can also be used in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, O2 is prone to over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 rather than the desired alkene. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that does not over-oxidize the alkane and can be used in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to produce the alkene and CO.

4. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are highly active for CO2 activation due to their redox properties, which allow for the facile transfer of oxygen atoms. CeO2 is also effective for CO2 activation due to its high oxygen mobility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms. Transition metal clusters, such as Mo2C, are also effective for CO2 activation due to their high reactivity and redox properties.

5. The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation over these catalysts involve the activation of CO2 by the metal oxide or transition metal cluster, leading to the formation of CO and a reactive oxygen species (*O). The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with redox-active metal oxides typically having lower barriers due to their redox properties. However, the stability and selectivity of the catalysts also play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

1. 红氧化金属氧化物催化剂，如V2O5和VOx/SiO2，在氧化脱氢烷烃反应中通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂向烷烃捐赠一个氧原子，形成相应的烯烃和水。然后催化剂通过CO2的还原再生，CO2提供了填充晶格氧空位所需的氧原子。这一过程由金属氧化物的氧化还原活性促进，允许氧原子的轻松转移。

2. 相比之下，非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga2O3/MxOy，通过异裂解离而不是氧化还原反应激活CO2。CO2被异裂解离为CO和活性氧物种(*O)，然后脱氢烷烃形成相应的烯烃和水。然而，这些催化剂在酸性位点结合烷烃，这可能导致裂解反应和焦炭的形成，导致催化剂失活。

3. 传统氧化剂，如分子氧(O2)，也可以用于氧化脱氢反应。然而，O2容易过度氧化，形成CO2而不是所需的烯烃。另一方面，CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不会过度氧化烷烃，可以与烷烃脱氢一起使用，产生烯烃和CO。

4. 不同催化剂在激活CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的有效性各不相同。V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其氧化还原性质，对CO2激活非常有效，允许氧原子的轻松转移。CeO2由于其高氧流动性，能够释放和回收氧原子，因此对CO2激活也很有效。过渡金属簇，如Mo2C，由于其高反应性和氧化还原性质，对CO2激活也很有效。

5. 这些催化剂上CO2解离的建议机制涉及金属氧化物或过渡金属簇对CO2的激活，形成CO和活性氧物种(*O)。CO2解离的能量势垒根据催化剂的不同而变化，氧化还原活性金属氧化物通常由于其氧化还原性质而具有较低的势垒。然而，催化剂的稳定性和选择性也在氧化脱氢反应的整体有效性中起着关键作用。
