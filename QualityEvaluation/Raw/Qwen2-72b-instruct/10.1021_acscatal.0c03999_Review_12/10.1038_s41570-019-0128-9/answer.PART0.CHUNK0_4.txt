1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes requires a bifunctional catalyst that can dissociate CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O. The *O species then dehydrogenates the adsorbed alkane, producing the corresponding alkene and H2O. In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga2O3/MxOy activate CO2 but bind alkanes at acidic sites, leading to cracking reactions that form coke and deactivate the catalyst. Traditional oxidants like O2 can over-oxidize substrates and form explosive mixtures, while CO2 is a mild oxidant that does not prone to over-oxidation. Transition metal clusters like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and CeO2 can activate CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed mechanisms involve the dissociation of CO2 into CO and *O, with the *O species dehydrogenating the alkane. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst, with V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 showing lower barriers than CeO2.

1. 烷烃的氧化脱氢需要一种双功能催化剂，能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种*O。*O物种然后脱氢吸附的烷烃，产生相应的烯烃和H2O。相比之下，像Ga2O3/MxOy这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂可以激活CO2，但在酸性位点结合烷烃，导致形成焦炭和使催化剂失活的裂解反应。传统的氧化剂如O2可能会过度氧化底物并形成爆炸性混合物，而CO2是一种温和的氧化剂，不容易过度氧化。过渡金属簇如V2O5，VOx/SiO2和CeO2可以激活CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。提出的机制涉及将CO2分解为CO和*O，*O物种脱氢烷烃。CO2分解的能量势垒根据催化剂的不同而变化，V2O5和VOx/SiO2的势垒低于CeO2。
