1. Introduction
Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a preferred method to eliminate NOx derivative emissions from diesel and from lean-burn gasoline exhausts. The engines operating under oxidizing atmo- spheres (lean-burn conditions) are more fuel efficient than those operating under rich conditions (excess fuel). The challenging issue is in this case to eliminate NOx under excess oxygen at a wide temperature window during the dynamic operation of an automobile. The SCR method employs reductant, typically NH3 and/or HC. Ammonia or Urea-SCR is the more widespread method employed to reduce NOx in lean exhausts of heavy duty vehicles and of stationary sources. Although the large applicability of this NOx-abatement method it still has some issues, i.e. such as unreacted NH3 NH3-slip [1]. Methane [2] and higher hydro- carbons such as propene [35], butane, hexane, and octane [6], are more suitable to reduce NOx at higher exhaust temperatures (250 8C). HC-SCR appears to be easier to adopt into engines,because unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) are mostly present in exhausts or it may be less problematic to intentionally add HC- based reducing agent(s) into the feed. In the Europe the diesel engines are more commonly used due to the fuel quality (i.e. low sulphur content). Issue is that during the driving cycle, diesel engines produce exhausts approx. 150 K colder than those from gasoline engines due to the nature of the combustion process [7]. In exhausts from diesel engines NOx must be eliminated at a temperature window varying from room temperature (cold start) at partial load speed up to 600 8C at high speed. For low- temperature applications, for instance below 250 8C, the use of hydrogen as reducing agent seems to be a good alternative to eliminate NOx under lean conditions if the mentioned conditions are applied [8,9].
The use of hydrogen as a reducing agent to eliminate NOx under lean exhausts at low-temperatures 250 8C is relatively new.
Most of the information related to H2-SCR of NOx has been published in the last 15 years. Although some research is devoted to the subject, there is yet no commercial application of hydrogen as a reductant for NOx-elimination. Platinum-supported catalysts (e.g. Pt/SiO2, Pt/Al2O3) have been more intensively studied for H2- SCR of NOx applications compared to any other group of metal supported catalysts such as Pd or Rh. Platinum is an active element towards the H2-SCR of NOx particularly at temperatures below 200 8C [10], however, the main problem is the side production of high volumes of N2O [8]. As reported by Costa and Efstathiou [11] depending on the reaction conditions, platinum-based catalysts can be very active towards the NOx-reduction and selective to nitrogen yielding NOx-conversions up to 7590% and nitrogen selectivities of 8090%. Although different support composition and platinum loading quantities were used, three Pt-based catalysts step forward with high NOx-reduction and N2-selectivity (0.1 wt.% Pt/La0.5Ce0.5MnO3,

La-based perovskites doped with palladium were synthesized by a modified citrate route and calcined at high temperature. The Fe/Co-ratio at the B-site of the perovskite (LaFe0.95xCoxPd0.05O3, x = 0.475, 0.4,
0.3) was intentionally varied in order to produce a single phase catalyst and to correlate the phase(s)
variations with its catalytic performance during the H2-SCR of NOx. A mixture of crystal phases containing orthorhombic and cubic perovskites, cobalt oxide and strongly bonded palladium oxide were observed in the sample with Fe/Co = 1. Single orthorhombic perovskite phase with traces of iron oxide and weak bonded palladium oxide was obtained with Fe/Co  2.2. The perovskite with Fe/Co = 1 displayed better NOx-reductions and N2-selectivities than the perovskite with Fe/Co = 2.2 ratio during dry H2-SCR of NOx. The same was observed with H2O + CO2 and in the presence of CO in the feed. The observed catalytic behaviour of both perovskites is discussed in association with the state of palladium in each investigated composition since the Pd-free perovskite displayed an extremely low NOx-reduction (below 4%). 2009 Elsevier B.V.

0.1 wt.% Pt/MgOCeO2). Despite, the very high catalytic activity
obtained with the platinum-supported catalysts, it is shown that they strongly deactivate in the presence of small volumes of carbon monoxide [10] which is readily present under real driving conditions.
The work published by Costa et al. [12,13] have shown that platinum-supported on perovskite-based structures (e.g.Pt/ La0.7Sr0.2Ce0.1FeO3, Pt/La0.5Ce0.5MnO3) provides excellent selectiv- ities to nitrogen over a relatively wide temperature window under SCR conditions. These catalysts show very good deactivation resistance and stability after the exposure to water vapour and 25 40 ppm of SO2. Even though this achievement, high costs due to the use of expensive precious metal, it can be considered as a handicap.
Therefore it is necessary to reduce the amount of platinum or completely replace it by cheaper alternatives such as palladium.
In contrast to the platinum-supported catalysts, the data reported in the scientific literature shows that Pd loaded catalysts are less active and sometimes inactive depending on the reaction conditions [8]. However, Pd-supported catalysts offer high potential as emphasized by the work of Qi et al. [14]. This statement was demonstrated by synthesizing a catalyst having 1% Pd-supported on 5% V2O5/TiO2Al2O3 treated in oxygen at 500 8C/ 6 h and tested in H2-SCR of NOx reactions. High catalytic activity and N2-selectivity of the catalysts were explained to be due to the operation of a bi-functional reaction mechanism between the support and Pd. V2O5 which is a typical NH3-SCR catalyst, may participate in the capture of reduced nitrogen species (e.g. NH3 and NH4 +) providing reaction sites for NO and O2 to yield nitrogen as Pd does.
More recently, obtainment of 100% NOx-conversion at 84 8C over Pd-LaCoO3 catalyst is reported, although the N2-selectivity was 64% and the activity was limited to a narrow and low- temperature window between 84 and 110 8C [15]. Below 80 8C and above 110 8C, the NOx-conversion with this catalyst was extremely low and a substantial amount of N2O was produced. The properties of the catalyst Pd-LaCoO3 were attributed to modification of surface palladium species (i.e. the formation of oxidic noble-metal species) [16].
The literature indicates that the potential of Pd-based catalysts has not been fully exploited. New Pd-supports and supports with new interaction sites results in the production of highly active centers. One way to tune the properties (i.e. NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities) of precious metals is to stabilize them by incorporating into perovskite structures. Moreover many precious metals other than Pd (i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium) can be stabilized inside perovskite lattices as well [17,18]. Integration of precious metals in perovskites yields a self- healing effect through the nano-scaled segregation of noble-metal particles, thus promoting the ageing-resistance at the long-term use of the catalyst [19]. In addition synergistic effects between the perovskite lattice and the metal(s) dissolved in the crystal lattice may lead to better NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities of the catalyst. The interaction between the perovskite and the precious metal may synergistically function together modifying the redox properties and producing a better catalyst.
The present study addresses the compositional phase changes with the variation of Fe/Co-ratio and the catalyst properties of Pd- integrated perovskites under H2-SCR of NOx conditions. The catalysts presented here are synthesized by employing a citrate route, in this synthesis method alternative precursors are employed to reduce the amount of nitrates, and nitrogen oxides formed during catalyst calcination. In order to simulate the possible thermal degradation of the catalysts occurring under practical applications, i.e. as in the case of close-coupled catalysts,the synthesized perovskites were exposed up to 900 8C. The crystal phase(s) formed at the perovskites were analyzed by means of the XRD paying special attention on the state of palladium in the catalysts. The Pd-integrated perovskites are then tested for selective reduction of NOx with hydrogen as a reductant (H2-SCR of NOx). Special emphasis is given to the possible correlations between the crystal structure, the phase composition and the NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities of the catalysts.
2. Synthesis of the catalysts
A modified citrate route was employed to synthesize the La- based perovskites LaFexCo(1xy)PdyO3 (x = 0.4, 0.475 and 0.65).
Palladium (y = 0.05) was substituted at the B-site of the perovskite during the synthesis at the expenses of cobalt content. The synthesis began with the preparation of separate sols of Lanthanum acetate (99.9%) which was dissolved in isopropanol, Co-acetylacetonate (98%) and Fe nitrate (99%) were dissolved in distilled water. To promote the dissolution of Co- acetylacetonate nitric acid was added to the solution, while sol formation of Fe(NO3)3 was achieved solely by addition of distilled water. Palladium di-nitrate (Pd(NO3)2) was first added to the iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) solution and then mixed with the cobalt source. Stoichiometric amount of citric acid with respect to the B-site of the perovskite was added to the mixture.
The resulting solution was mixed with La-acetate (LaCOO(CH3)3) sol under thoroughly stirring. Ethylene glycol was added at a mass ratio of 40:60 with respect to the citric acid. In our synthesis the solvent was removed with a rota-vapour at 80 8C.
Partial combustion and elimination of the organic matter was made over a heated plate. The resulting spongy solid was slightly grounded with an agate mortar and finally calcined for 3 h at temperatures up to 900 8C. A more detailed description of the modified citrate route employed to synthesized the palladium integrated perovskite LaFexCo(1xy)PdyO3 is reported elsewhere [20].
3. Characterization
3.1. Phase(s) and microstructural analysis
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis was made with a NETZSCH 404 analyzer. Tablets of 4.65 mm diameter of the perovskite powders were prepared. The temperature was raised up to 900 8C at a constant heating rate of 10 8C/min under static air. X- ray diffraction (XRD) powder method was employed to determine the crystal phase(s) present in the synthesized catalysts. Diffrac- tion patterns reported here were obtained in a diffractometer SIEMENS D5000 in Bragg Brentano Geometry using Cu Ka1+2 radiations. Powder samples were slightly grounded in agate mortar and supported on the sample holder for analysis. In-situ XRD measurements were made in an XPert PRO X-ray diffraction system from Phillips.
The XPS spectra were measured with a Leybold surface spectrometer equipped with a Specs EA 10/100 electron analyser with multi-channel detection. Samples were analyzed in the as- received state and after reduction in diluted H2 (4.5 vol.% in Ar) at 200 8C and at 500 8C, avoiding air contact of the reduced samples during introduction into the vacuum system. Spectra were recorded with Mg Ka excitation (1253.6 eV, 12 kV, 20 mA). Binding energies will be reported relative to C 1s = 284.5 eV.
Microstructural analysis of the powder samples was made with a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) from Zeiss Ultra 55 equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) from Oxford Instruments.
The temperature-programmed reduction has been measured after a previous calcination treatment (9.3% O2/Ar, 10 K/min ramp to 350 8C, held for 1 a at 350 8C), The TPR was performed with

4.36% H2 in Ar, at a 10 K/min ramp to 800 8C where the sample was
kept isothermally for several hours. The TPR profiles have been integrated to yield hydrogen consumptions (in mmol/g) which will be compared with the nominal Pd content.
3.2. Catalytic test
Prior to the test reaction each catalyst was pelletized. Discs of compacted powder having 1.5 cm diameter were prepared with small amountofcatalyst powder and applying a pressure of9 tonnes during 3045 s. Samples were slightly crushed into small pieces with an agate mortar and sieved with mesh sizes between 250 and 450 mm. 300 mg of fresh catalyst was fixed inside a tubular quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure (outer diameter = 5 mm). Catalysts were supported on a plug of quartz wool and maintained in a constant position using a hollow quartz support rod. All the lines were heated and thermal isolated to avoid water condensation. The temperature of the catalyst was measured by a thermocouple in direct contact with the bed catalyst. The NO and NO2 signals were continuously monitored using a chemiluminescent NO/NOx analy- zer SIGNAL series 4000 at the facilities of CenTACat. Prior to entering into the NOx analyzer the effluent gas mixture was passed through a water trap. The gas phase was analyzed with an IR spectrometer from BRUKER. Gas mixtures with NO, H2, O2, CO2 and H2O including increasing concentrations of N2O (all BOC gases) were prepared in order to calibrate and calculate the N2O formed during the reaction.
Integration of the area below the corresponding IR bands 2202 and 2236 cm1 allowed us to calculate the amount of N2O formed during our experiments (see reaction (2)). Since NH3 was not detected during our experiments, the N2 concentration was calculated by the difference between feedstock and effluent concentrations of the N- containing species. The reactions considered in this work are listed below:
2NO  4H2  O2 ! N2  4H2O
(1)
2NO  3H2  O2 ! N2O  3H2O
(2)

(3) Each catalyst was tested in the temperature range between 50 and 400 8C, holding the catalyst at each interval for 30 min and increasing the temperature with 50 8C steps. Each point given in the graphics of the next sections is the average of this data. The evaluation of the results was made by applying the following equations: NOx-conversion to N2 and N2O: X  NOxin  NOxout NOxin 100% % selectivity to N2O:

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Crystal phase(s) of the catalysts
In the investigated perovskite-based catalysts LaFex- Co(1xy)PdyO3, only the lanthanum atoms shall occupy the A-site as the other three elements (Fe, Co, Pd) share the B-site. The Fe/Co- ratio of the perovskite was intentionally modified by increasing the Fe-content and keeping the La and Pd contents constant. Table 1 summarises the perovskites compositions synthesized in the present study. The samples are designated with the codes attributing to the Co-content since all the samples contain the same amount of lanthanum and palladium. This sample code is used in the following. All samples were treated at 500 8C/3 h before DSC analysis. DSC measurements indicate two phase transformations,one being at around 600 8C and the second signal at approx. 640 8C for both perovskites designated with LFC(0.3)-Pd and LCF(0.4)-Pd (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). These observed phase transformations in the lanthanum-based perovskites partially correlate with the results reported by Persson et al. [21]. According to their results,temperature-induced reduction of palladium in a PdPt/Al2O3 catalyst begins at around 600 8C and ends up abruptly below 700 8C displaying an asymmetric peak.On the other hand, palladium supported alone on Al2O3 starts to decompose at 700 8C ending at around 850 8C by displaying a symmetric peak. In turn our DSC results obtained with the perovskites LFC(0.3)-Pd and LFC(0.4)-Pd display the beginning of a phase transition at approx. 570 8C. This probably related to the crystallization of the perovskite [20,22]. A second phase transformation which begins at a higher temperature and ends up at approx. 670 8C (also an asymmetric peak) that might be due to palladium reduction from a bimetallic alloy, maybe bimetallic compound(s) such as PdCo. Similar alloys were already observed in the intelligent catalyst reported by Nishihata et al. [19] who synthesized a perovskite with the composition LaFe0.57- Table 1 Phase composition of the perovskites after calcination in air at 900 8C/3 h as a function of the Co-content.

We assume that in our catalyst the PdCo particles may also be formed due to the cobalt excess in the perovskite. The DSC-spectra ofthe perovskiteLFC(0.475)-Pddisplaysa plateau up to 900 8C which suggest the presence of palladium,maybe in the form of PdCo particles or both Pd and PdCo being strongly bonded to the perovskite (see Fig. 1).
The perovskite LFC(0.3)-Pd is composed of only the orthorhombic phase after being calcined in air at 700 8C, and no other oxides were detected by XRD analysis. After calcination treatment at 900 8C the orthorhombic perovskite was still present, traces of tetragonal PdO were also found. The perovskite LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 consists of the pure cubic phase and was prepared by calcining the amorphous citrate precursor at 700 8C/2 h and that containing the orthorhombic perovskite phase was obtained after calcination at 850 8C/6 h of the same composition if the glycinenitrate combustion process is applied [23]. However as we have demonstrated previously, it is also possibletosynthesizeorthorhombic perovskites withLaFe0.6Co0.4O3 composition on calcination at 700 8C [24]. Merino et al. prepared rhombohedral perovskite structures applying the citrate route and calcination treatments up to 700 8C [25]. These observations point out tothe importance of the synthesismethod ofthe perovskites and their calcination treatment(s) afterwards. In our study, as the cobalt content in the perovskite LaFexCo0.95xPd0.05O3 increases, higher cobalt oxide (Co3O4) contents were detected on calcination at 900 8C. The sharp increase of the reflection at 2u = 31.18 and the appearance of the reflection at 2u = 18.98 indicate that the cobalt excess in the catalysts segregates to form cobalt oxide (Co3O4). The increase ofcobaltatthe expense ofiron atthe B-siteofthe perovskite LaFexCo0.95xPd0.05O3 (x = 0.65, 0.55, 0.475) causes a shift to higher 2u values (see Fig. 2) yielding the formation of the orthorhombic perovskite phase. At the same time, this implies the incorporation of cobalt into the main perovskite lattice to a certain extent. The perovskite with the highest cobalt content LFC(0.475)-Pd contains only the orthorhombic phase after calcination in air at 900 8C/3 h. In fact as the in-situ heated XRD experiments reveal, the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd may also contain some cubic together with the orthorhombic perovskite phase.
In an attempt to clarify the conditions of palladium diffusion out of the lattice of the perovskite, the composition LFC(0.475)-Pd was reduced in flowing (20 ml/min) of 1 vol.% H2/He mixture at different temperatures beginning from room temperature up to 800 8C and cooling down to room temperature under the same conditions (see Fig. 3). It is observed that the main reflection at 2u = 32.78 was split into two peaks at 600 8C and above, confirming the presence of the orthorhombic and the cubic phases simulta- neously. Split of the reflections located at higher Bragg angles (2u = 40.1, 46.8, 52.7, 58.2, 68.5, and 77.98) were also observed.
This splitting at the Bragg-reflections of the perovskite phases was completely reversible. Excess cobalt and the palladium oxides were reduced in the composition (LFC(0.475)-Pd) under the selected conditions at the temperature range between 625 and 650 8C,while the perovskite phase remained stable even after reduction at 800 8C. Peak (Bragg-reflections) splitting observed under oxidizing conditions suggests that this process was thermally activated. On the other hand, in the perovskite composition LFC(0.3)-Pd, no segregation was observed indicating the formation of a single phase catalyst. The XRD-patterns taken at room temperature of similar perovskite compositions reported in the literature (LaFe0.5- Co0.5O3), display already a doublet in the main peak which is an indicative of the rhombohedral structure [25].
The microstructure of the perovskite catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd is given in Fig. 4. A porous morphology formed through connected particles was obtained for the catalysts after being calcined at 900 8C/3 h (BET-surface area = 1.7 m2/g). The perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd calcined at 900 8C/3 h has a BET-surface area of 2.1 m2/g. Fig. 5 shows the surface of the LFC(0.475)-Pd perovskite.
4.2. XPS surface analysis
The XPS experiments on LFC(0.3)-Pd perovskites indicate that the binding energy (BE) of La 3d5/2 was found to be 833.1 eV (Fig. 6) and did not change even after reduction treatment in 4.2 vol.% H2 in Ar at 500 8C. The reduction treatment was applied to force the diffusion of the Pd-ions out of the perovskite lattice. It is important to remember that the reaction (lean) conditions applied during the catalytic Fig. 2. XRD-patterns of the synthesized La-based perovskites calcined in static air at 900 8C/3 h.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 307 measurements are completely different than those in these reduction treatments. The XPS results clearly indicate a binding energy of 711 eV for iron which corresponds to Fe3+ (Fig. 6). This element remains unchanged after the reduction treatment at 500 8C.
Therefore, it is expected that these two elements remain also unchanged under reaction conditions. On the other side, cobalt oxidation state was not fully identified because of the wide binding- energy range covered, which results in slight uncertainties in the course of the base line, and the very large width of the satellite feature, which leads to complications in the quantitative differ- entiation between the satellite and main peak. However, the BE
779.8 eV clearly indicates the presence of Co3+, which is in well
agreement with the data reported in the literature [25]. In addition,the presence of satellite lines in our XPS data suggest that a significant part of cobalt in the surface region is in the 2+ state [22].
The results indicate a further increase contribution of Co(II) in the reduced sample at 200 8C and the reduction at 500 8C leaves the oxidation stateessentiallyunchanged.Previousreduction treatment in 10% H2/90% N2 on similar Pd-integrated perovskite (LaFe0.57- Co0.38Pd0.05O3) at 800 8C leaded to only 30% of the elements occupying the B-site were transformed into the metallic state [26].
Evidence of the CoCo, CoPd and PdPd bonds was found by means of EXAFS experiments.
The Pd 3d lines of the initial Pd-integrated perovskites synthesized in the present work display clearly asymmetric lines which indicate the presence of additional ionic palladium states probably including Pd intra-crystalline [22,27]. At least three ionic Pd states may be discerned on the basis of the peak fitting analysis.
The BE between 335.8 and 336.5 eV indicates the presence of Pd2+ (i.e. PdO). The BE between 337.3 and 337.8 eV observed in the perovskites are related with Pd intra-crystalline, Pd 3d5/2 binding energies of 337 eV are associated with Pd-ions dissolved in the perovskitic crystal lattice [17,19]. The observed BEs partially disappear after the reduction treatment already at
200 8C
suggesting the diffusion of Pd-ions out of the crystal lattice. The Fig. 5. FE-SEM-Image (50,000) of the perovskite surface LFC(0.475)-Pd after calcination in static air at 900 8C/3 h.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 308 BE of 335 eV demonstrates the presence of Pd metallic upon reduction. Higher BEs at ca. 346 eV suggests the formation of other Pd-species which survived reduction at 500 8C, further details regarding the XPS results are discussed in more detail in [22,27].
It might be possible the formation of an alloy between Co and Pd particularly in the perovskite with higher cobalt content (LFC(0.475)-Pd). On the other hand, alloying at the nanoscale between Fe and Pd upon reduction treatment (or under the reaction conditions) cannot be completely ruled out.
In general two O 1s states are found in the perovskites (Fig. 6),one around 529 eV which corresponds to lattice oxygen and one at around 531 eV which can be assigned to oxygen from small amount of carbonates [24]. These oxygen species are only slightly affected upon reduction treatment up to 500 8C. Small changes in the oxygen lattice concentration indicate that these species are strongly bonded to the perovskite. However, the formation of anion vacancies upon reduction cannot be completely excluded.
On the other side, the amount of the oxygen species from the adsorbed carbonates decrease, without being completely removed upon reduction, with increasing temperature. This indicates that these oxygen species should be stable and also present during the catalyst testing under lean reaction conditions.
4.3. H2-TPR studies
A very surprising result obtained in the presence of Pd,characteristically either supported or lattice integrated, Pd suppresses the reducibility of the perovskite itself. LaFe0.65Co0.35O3 exhibits several reduction peaks below 800 8C. At and above 800 8C, another high-temperature peak is obviously on growth,which is intercepted by the end of the temperature ramp (Fig. 7).
During the low-temperature peaks, ca. 2 mille mole of hydrogen/g are consumed. These peaks are completely missing in the Pd- containing samples. This looks like a co-reduction, which is very familiar in catalysis, the presence of a noble-metal facilitates the reduction of the Fe- or Co-species in the perovskite, the TPR peaks of these species shift to lower temperatures with the presence of palladium. This had been already observed for some Pd-containing perovskites [28]. However, this seems not to be the case here: the hydrogen consumption of the Pd-supported catalyst (Pd-LaFe0.65- Co0.35O3) is about the same as that of the pure perovskite support,but it fits almost ideally with the expectations from the Pd content (1 H2 per Pd2+ ! Pd). In the perovskite (LFC(0.3)-Pd), the H2- consumption is even smaller than the low-temperature H2- consumption of the support. Thus the low-temperature peaks of the support have largely disappeared.
At both Pd-containing samples, the reduction occurs in two steps, the low-temperature step being smaller (Fig. 7). Similar to the conclusion from the XPS analysis, this might be attributed to the presence of near-surface lattice species, which can be more easily reduced, and that of bulk species, which require higher reduction temperatures. However, these two peaks may also originate from near-surface species of different stability, the reduction of bulk Pd2+ occurring beyond 800 8C. As mentioned above, Pd-supported on the perovskite Pd-LaFe0.65Co0.35O3 was completely reduced (under the assumption that the support reduction is fully suppressed), however, in the Pd-containing catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd, part of Pd may remain unreduced even after treatment at 800 8C.
Pure PdO is known to be reduced at very low temperatures. The peak at about 100 8C could be originated from PdO (although it is known from the literature that the reduction may occur at even lower temperatures). Quite surprisingly, the reduction tempera- tures in the impregnated sample are in general higher than those of the one with Pd in the lattice. The main reduction peak is rather broad, but appears at the same region as the main reduction peak in Pd-LaFe0.65Co0.35O3. As in the La system, only the (nominally) Pd incorporated sample contains species that are reduced around 100 8C and thus likely to be the surface PdO. In turn, Pd- LaFe0.65Co0.35O3 was completely reduced after 2 h in a similar gas mixture (4% H2/inert) at 200 8C whereas the TPR profile is at this stage just in its first increase. There is, of course, a significant difference between the non-stationary temperature regime of TPR and a long isothermal treatment; however, it is hard to believe that those species that appear at 425 8C in TPR might be reduced by an extended treatment at 200 8C. This question might be answered by additional XPS measurements.
A contradiction exists with LFC(0.3)-Pd, where almost identical reduction degrees were seen by XPS after reduction at 200 and 500 8C. According to the TPR, two different values should have been obtained. Again, here the same logic can be followed for explanation of the observed results. If a 2 h treatment at 200 8C was already enough to reduce those species that appear in the TPR around 350 8C, then, it is likely that the oxidation state seen after 200 8C reduction is the same as that detected after 500 8C reduction. Moreover, the remaining bulk Pd2+ seems to be in any case very stable.
4.4. Catalytic tests
4.4.1. NO/O2/H2 reactions
The cobalt content in the perovskites LFC(0.475)-Pd, LFC(0.4)-Pd, LFC(0.3)-Pd was intentionally varied at the expense of iron in order to determine the correlation between the cobalt content and their catalytic performance. The perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd clearly display the presence of cobalt oxide Co3O4 as derived from the XRD analysis discussed in the last section. The cobalt content decrease in the perovskite caused a decrement of cobalt oxide in the perovskite composition LFC(0.3)-Pd. As discussed in the last section,upon cobalt decrease, i.e. variation of Fe/Co-ratio, the composition and the phase constitution of the catalyst change. The effect of these changes and modifications on the H2-SCR of NOx reactions is discussed in the following section.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 309 Both perovskites LFC(0.475)-Pd and LFC(0.3)-Pd displayed very good NOx-reduction activity under simple gas mixtures (NO + O2 + H2 + He) (see Fig. 8). Maximum NOx-conversion values of about 79% were observed between 180 and 230 8C with the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd. These NOx-conversion values are slightly higher than those measured within the same temperature window with the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd which yields a maximum NOx- conversion of 74% at 200 8C. The NOx-conversion of both perovskites display typical volcano-shape behaviour suggesting the presence of competingredoxreactionswhich may involve thedissociationofNO into Nads and Oads as suggested in the literature [8]. This reaction is optimally achieved between 200 and 250 8C on the perovskite catalysts reported here. As the Co-content of the La-based perovskites decreases, the N2-selectivity shifts to higher tempera- tures (see Fig. 8). However comparing the N2O formation during this reaction, it is evident that the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd produced slightly less N2O (approx. 35 ppm) between 160 and 240 8C than the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd (Fig. 9). It is remarkable to note that the perovskite LFC(0.3)-Pd reduced less NOx than the perovskite with higher cobalt content LFC(0.475)-Pd. This suggests that either cobalt (i.e. or the cobalt species) may be involved in the creation of active sites for participation in the NOx-reduction and/or the bimetallic particles containing Pd and Co are involved in diverse reactions (i.e. NO- chemisorption and -dissociation, H2-chemisorption,and
N2O
formation). The latter can be formed on small local reducing environments which occur during the NOx-reduction reaction [16].
4.4.2. The effect of H2O + CO2
Considering the reaction conditions related to automotive exhausts, water and carbon dioxide will always be present in the exhausts of any combustion engines and may influence the performance of the catalyst during the H2-SCR of NOx reaction.
Indeed, Fig. 10 shows the effect of H2O + CO2 on the NOx-reduction and N2-selectivity under lean conditions when applying H2 as a reducing agent. This graph includes the NOx-conversion over a Pt/ SiO2 catalyst under similar reaction conditions as the perovskites catalytic tests (the Pt/SiO2 catalyst was provided by CenTACat).
Clearly, the NOx-conversion decreases as the cobalt content in the Fig. 8.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 310 perovskite decreases while the level of N2-selectivity is maintained.
On the other hand, the Pt-supported catalyst Pt/SiO2 was active during the H2-SCR of NOx reaction, but, most of the converted NOx (5055%) was transformed into N2O at the maximum conversion temperatures. Despite the fact that the reaction conditions applied in the present study differ with the ones reported in the literature,the NOx-conversions obtained in this study agrees well with those obtained with a Pt/SiO2 catalyst previously reported [8].
The effect of water vapour on the NOx-conversion performance of platinum-supported catalysts is somewhat controversial. The presence of water vapour in the reactant mixture yields a negative impact on the NOx-conversion performance of platinum-sup- ported catalysts [8]. The presence of 5 vol.% H2Ovapour caused a decrease of 10% in NOx-conversion of 1 wt.% Pt/Al2O3 at temperatures above 130 8C and an increment in the N2O formation.
A significant decrease in the N2-production was measured over a 1 wt.% Pt/SiO2 at all reaction temperatures. More recently Costa and Efstathiou [11] reported positive results related to the NOx- conversion and the N2-selectivity in the presence of 5 vol.% of H2Ovapour over a catalyst having 0.1 wt.% Pt supported on an MgO CeO2 mixed oxide. This catalyst displayed no deactivation under reaction at 200 8C during 24 h in presence of water vapour.
In our study the tests carried out in the presence of water vapour and CO2 over the Pd-substituted perovskite catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd displayed a temperature dependency of the reaction.
The NOx-reduction performance of the catalyst decreases below 250 8C, while above 250 8C no change in the NOx- conversion was observed. At lower temperatures, it is likely that water molecules compete with the NO molecules in adsorption on the active sites, thus affecting the NOx performance and increasing the N2O formation similar to the performance observed over the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts during H2-SCR of NOx in the presence of water [8]. As the temperature increases above 250 8C, less N2O forms over the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd. Being water vapour and CO2 present in the feed, this suggests that water molecules may dissociate easily at higher temperatures on the catalyst surface promoting the formation of Hads species which would increase the concentration of Nads species according to the reaction NOad- s + Hads ! Nads + OHads as previously proposed by Dhainaut et al.
[29]. Consequently the formation of molecular nitrogen increases as a result of the reaction between two adjacent chemisorbed nitrogen atoms on the catalyst surface. These reactions would take place on the Pd-surface and or on the surface of the PdCo or PdFe species since the Pd-free perovskite displayed almost no activity for the H2-SCR of NOx reaction. The physicalchemical properties of palladium are surely modified by the interaction with the La- based perovskites. For instance, localized defects at the interface metal/support such as Pd and anionic vacancies from the support may cooperate together to produce a catalyst with a better selectivity to nitrogen. Reports in the literature support such reaction mechanisms for NO reduction with H2 over Pd/LaCoO3 perovskites [29].
In contrast, the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd yields a clear improve- ment in the NOx-conversion with water vapour in the feed. This perovskite reduces 20% more NOx with water vapour in the feed compared to the NOx-conversion under dry conditions at 350 8C.
The formation of N2O decreases with water vapour in the reaction mixture below 250 8C and remains almost unchanged at higher temperatures. In this case, it is likely that water dissociates on the catalyst surface facilitating the formation of molecular nitrogen and reducing the probability of N2O formation. N2O may also be decomposed under certain reaction conditions over cobalt oxides as reported by Yan et al. [30]. The improved selectivity to N2 has been in some cases attributed to the presence of alloy compounds such as Pd3La [16,31]. From our point of view, it is highly possible that this phase(s) contribute to the better N2-selectivities of the Pd- doped Lanthanum-based perovskites. This aspect will be definitely discussed in future investigations.
Table 2 compiles some typical reaction conditions for the H2- SCR of NOx reaction reported in the literature and the ones applied for the Pt and Pd-containing catalysts tested in this study. This table includes the maximum NOx-conversions and the N2- selectivities measured at a determined reaction conditions. The table encloses the properties of Pt-based catalysts supported on different oxides reported in the literature as well as including the properties of the Perovskites synthesized and characterized in this study. As the comparison exhibits these Perovskites are particu- larly active and highly selective to N2 during the NOx-reduction at temperatures below 200 8C.
4.4.3. The effect of CO in the feed
The present study shows that CO in the model gas mixture has a detrimental impact to the NOx-conversion and to the N2- selectivity of the tested catalysts. Fig. 11 displays the correspond- ing catalytic activity during the H2-NOx-SCR reaction under lean conditions including CO in the feed.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 311 (Fe/Co-ratio = 1) shows the best catalytic performance yielding 54% N2-selectivity at 180 8C and 46% N2-selectivity at 210 8C as remains almost constant up to about 290 8C (see graph (b) in Fig. 11). Increase of Fe at the expense of Co-content in the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd (Fe/Co-ratio from 1 to 2.2) leads to a slightly negative impact on the NOx-reduction performance at approx. 225 8C and above (see graph (a) in Fig. 11). Also, lower N2-formation rates were observed with the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd. A maximum N2- selectivity of 34% was measured at 237 8C with this catalyst. At higher temperatures, the N2-selectivity decreases to approx. 10% at 340 8C due to the relatively high concentration of N2O formed at this temperature. These results indicate that higher cobalt concentration in the catalyst, leads to formation of probably perovskite phase(s), as seen after the in-situ XRD analysis, which are more stable against CO poisoning. The formation of new intermetallic phases is certainly possible between the compo- nents of the perovskite Fe, Co, and Pd that may be less susceptible to CO poisoning.
In the present investigation, the NOx-reduction performance of both catalysts LFC(0.475)-Pd and LFC(0.3)-Pd decreased with the presence of CO in the feed. According to the literature, CO reduces the rate of NO dissociation as contributing to the loss of NOx- conversion and N2-selectivity [10]. This could be explained by the competitive adsorption of both CO and NO molecules on the same active sites. The co-adsorption of molecular CO and NO on Pd surfaces is a complex process which is weakly dependant on the surface temperature and strongly dependant on the Pd crystal planes exposed on the catalyst surface [32].
The NOx-reduction and N2-selectivity of the perovskite catalysts depend also on the Fe/Co-ratio at the B-site of the perovskite LFC(x)-Pd. The NOx-conversion over the catalyst LFC(0.3)-Pd was positively affected in the presence of CO at temperatures below 250 8C in comparison to the NOx-conversion on the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd. At 200 8C less N2O was formed over LFC(0.475)-Pd than over LFC(0.3)-Pd. Whereas at 250 8C the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd produced slightly more N2O in comparison to LFC(0.3)-Pd. At 300 8C the catalyst with high Co-content LFC(0.475)-Pd produced less N2O at higher NOx-conversions than the perovskite with low Co-content LFC(0.3)-Pd. This unsteadiness indicates a complex N2O formation behaviour on the surface of both perovskites. The differences in NOx-conversion and N2O formation rates can be attributed to the Fe/Co-ratio at both La-based perovskites LFC(0.3)-Pd and LFC(0.475)-Pd. Less Co- or higher Fe-content in the perovskites cause modifications in phase composition that in turn modify the state of palladium and therefore its surface characteristics. In addition, care must be taken in interpreting the results obtained after each reaction. Besides the NO reduction and the CO-oxidation many other reactions may take place such as the NO dissociation and/or the water gas shift reaction. These heterogeneous reactions have been extensively reported in the literature [33]. In the practice they are very sensitive to the system conditions such as temperature, gas flow, and the adsorptiondesorption properties of the different gas species,i.e. CO, H2, NO, N2O, H2O, and O2, on the catalyst surface.
5. Conclusions
Analysis show that the structure and the phase formation of the synthesized Pd-integrated perovskites (LaFe(0.95x)CoxPd0.05O3) are strongly affected by small variations in the Fe to Co-ratio.
XRD
analysis indicates that the solubility limit of Co in LaFe(0.95x)CoxPd0.05O3 is slightly below the mole fraction of 0.3.
Higher Co-contents (>0.3 mol%) result in a mixture of the orthorhombic and cubic perovskites with traces of cobalt oxide.
Despite the fact, that some free cobalt oxide was present, the perovskitic catalysts were always phase stable in hydrogen containing atmospheres regardless its composition. Under these conditions, excess cobalt oxide in the high Co-content LFC(0.475)-Pd,and the segregated PdO present in both perovskite compositions were completely reduced. On the other hand, under lean reaction conditions, the catalysts were stable even after the NOx reaction.
The XRD measurements showed no changes in the phase composition. If some local changes happened, these may be observed only by TEM or can be made visible by means of similar analytical techniques. This means that more efforts are needed to elucidate the formation of possible nano-alloys during and after reaction in these and other precious metal containing catalysts.
It can be said by considering the catalytic performance of the perovskites that the NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities and consequently the N2O formation on the perovskites strongly depend on the catalyst composition. This is true for the ratios of the A- and B- site components and especially the type of the precious metal present in the catalyst. For instance, as unpublished results indicate, Rh-containing perovskite catalyst does not display any activity during the H2-SCR of NOx reaction, whereas, Pd is very active for this reaction. The state(s) of palladium, i.e. the crystal phase(s), and the crystal planes, surely play also a very important role during the H2- SCR of NOx reaction. Palladium is strongly bonded to the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd as observed from the DSC experiments and this reflects on the catalytic performance. This catalyst reduces more NOx even in the presence of water vapour + carbon dioxide in the feed than the perovskite with less cobalt content LFC(0.3)-Pd. The Co-excess in the perovskite causes two principal effects on the sample; one is the mixture of the orthorhombic and the cubic perovskite phases, and the second is the segregated cobalt oxide. How each of these Fig. 11. NOx-conversion (a) and N2-selectivity (b) of the perovskites LFC(0.475)-Pd and LFC(0.3)-Pd calcined in static air at 900 8C/3 h.

n Rodr guez, B. Saruhan / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 93 (2010) 304313 312 characteristics contributes to the NOx-reduction and N2-selectivity of the catalyst has to be proved.
In the presence of CO in the feed, the NOx-conversions on both perovskites are modified probably due to the co-adsorption of both gases at the same active sites. However the perovskite LFC(0.475)-Pd displays slightly better NOx-conversions and N2-selectivities,when compared to the catalyst with less cobalt LFC(0.3)-Pd. Two aspects can be addressed in order to explain these observations.
One can assume that the improved NOx-reduction of the catalyst LFC(0.475)-Pd is due to the presence of the orthorhombic and the cubic perovskite phase(s). It is possible that these phases also contribute in the stabilization of palladium in one way or another,thus producing a perovskite crystal (orthorhombic or cubic) with small palladium crystallites in its surface showing different crystal planes. The second assumption is the alloying between PdCo due to the excess cobalt leaving a perovskite with Fe/Co = 1. Formation of other alloys between Pd and La are certainly possibly and will be matter of further studies.
