[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."

[4] "The substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[5] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[6] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[7] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[8] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

[9] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, can significantly influence the behavior of NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Depending on the valence of the dopant, the electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO can be increased or decreased, leading to changes in the activity of ethane ODH. The presence of niobium in the NiO lattice can reduce non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, resulting in fewer unselective oxygen species and enhanced ethane ODH activity. The higher the valence of the dopant cation, the higher the selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity. The correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene is clear, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion.

1.铌氧化物具有多种稳定形式和氧化态，可以显著影响NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为。根据掺杂剂的价态，NiO的亲电子氧自由基可以增加或减少，导致乙烷ODH活性的变化。铌在NiO晶格中的存在可以减少非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致较少的非选择性氧物种和增强的乙烷ODH活性。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高，对所需产物的初始选择性越高，其中NiNb表现出最高的选择性。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性，这两个值随着外来阳离子价态的增加而呈反比趋势。16O交换的表面速率与C2H6消耗的表面速率之间的线性关系证实了监测的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化机制中发挥的积极作用。

1.铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，通过影响NiO催化剂中非选择性亲电氧自由基的行为，影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢中的作用。根据掺杂剂的价态，亲电氧自由基可以增加或减少，导致乙烷ODH活性降低或增强。含有铌的混合氧化物的增强催化活性与存在多功能正交相有关。铌离子填充了阳离子空位和/或替换了NiO晶格中的镍原子，形成了NiNb固溶体。这一置换过程减少了非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致非选择性氧物种的减少和乙烷ODH活性的增强。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高，对所需产品初始选择性越高。NiO在乙烷ODH中的催化性质可以通过掺杂根据Me促进的NiO催化剂中掺杂剂的性质进行调节。根据外来物种的价态，掺杂剂可以增加或减少NiO的非选择性亲电氧自由基，分别导致乙烷到乙烯的选择性转化活性降低或增强。

1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects of the NiO lattice. The substitution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice reduces the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. The multifunctional properties of niobium, such as its ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, enable it to fill cationic vacancies and substitute nickel atoms, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is responsible for the reduction of non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, which in turn reduces the unselective oxygen species and enhances ethane ODH activity. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts inversely correlates with the selectivity to ethylene. The less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO are more selective and convert ethane to ethylene. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene supports the above findings. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质,包括它们的各种稳定形态和氧化态,通过影响NiO晶格的非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷,影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌离子取代到NiO晶格中,减少了非选择性亲电氧自由基,从而增强了乙烷ODH活性。铌的多功能性质,如其离子半径、价态和电子供体性质,使其能够填充阳离子空位并取代镍原子,形成NiNb固溶体。这一取代过程负责减少非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷,从而减少非选择性氧物种,增强乙烷ODH活性。掺杂离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。Ni基催化剂中容纳的非化学计量性氧与对乙烯的选择性成反比。高价态掺杂NiO的不移动氧物种更具选择性,将乙烷转化为乙烯。16O交换的表面速率与C2H6消耗的表面速率之间的线性关系证实了监测的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化机制中的积极作用。非化学计量性氧与选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间的明显相关性支持了上述发现。掺杂离子的价态越高,NiO晶格中的额外正电荷越高,导致氧物种减少,乙烯选择性提高。
