[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."

[4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[5] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[6] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[7] "Therefore, an important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

[8] "Based on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced activity in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene."

1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO. Depending on the valence of the dopant, the electrophilic oxygen radicals can be increased or decreased, leading to reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity. The enhanced catalytic activity of mixed oxides containing niobium is related to the presence of a multifunctional orthorhombic phase. Niobium cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process reduces the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, leading to a reduction in unselective oxygen species and enhanced ethane ODH activity. The higher the valence of the dopant cations, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts. The dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to reduced or enhanced activity in the selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.

1.铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，通过影响NiO催化剂中非选择性亲电氧自由基的行为，影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢中的作用。根据掺杂剂的价态，亲电氧自由基可以增加或减少，导致乙烷ODH活性降低或增强。含有铌的混合氧化物的增强催化活性与存在多功能正交相有关。铌离子填充了阳离子空位和/或替换了NiO晶格中的镍原子，形成了NiNb固溶体。这一置换过程减少了非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致非选择性氧物种的减少和乙烷ODH活性的增强。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高，对所需产品初始选择性越高。NiO在乙烷ODH中的催化性质可以通过掺杂根据Me促进的NiO催化剂中掺杂剂的性质进行调节。根据外来物种的价态，掺杂剂可以增加或减少NiO的非选择性亲电氧自由基，分别导致乙烷到乙烯的选择性转化活性降低或增强。
