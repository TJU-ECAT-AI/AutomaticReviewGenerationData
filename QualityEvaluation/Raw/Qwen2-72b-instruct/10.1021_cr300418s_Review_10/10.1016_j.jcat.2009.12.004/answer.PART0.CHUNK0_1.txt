[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[3] "The substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry."

[4] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[5] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

[6] "Therefore, an important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts."

1.The valence of the dopant in NiO catalysts plays a crucial role in the behavior of niobium oxides as dopants for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity. The substitution process occurring upon the introduction of the foreign elements seems to be responsible for the increase or decrease in nickel oxides non-stoichiometry. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above. An important outcome of this work is that the catalytic properties of NiO in ethane ODH can be tuned with doping, according to the nature of the dopant in Me-promoted NiO catalysts. However, reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems remains a challenge.

1.铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂中乙烷氧化脱氢的掺杂剂,其不同的性质,包括各种稳定形态和氧化态,对催化剂行为有重要影响。根据外来物种的价态,掺杂剂可以增加或减少NiO中无选择性的亲电氧自由基,从而导致乙烷ODH活性的降低或增强。外来元素引入时发生的置换过程似乎对镍氧化物非化学计量的增加或减少负有责任。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性将乙烷基质转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性,随着外来阳离子价态的增加,这两个值呈反比趋势,这有力地支持了上述观点。这项工作的一个重要成果是,根据Me促进的NiO催化剂中掺杂剂的性质,可以通过掺杂来调节NiO在乙烷ODH中的催化性能。然而,在研究这些复杂的催化系统时,将理论预测与实验观察相协调仍然是一个挑战。
