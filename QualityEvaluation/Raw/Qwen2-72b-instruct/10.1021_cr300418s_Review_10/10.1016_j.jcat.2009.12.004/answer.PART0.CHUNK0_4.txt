[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."

[4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[5] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[6] "The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to ethylene [17,35]."

[7] "The increase in ethylene selectivity with increasing dopant valence in the NiMeO mixed oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert ethane to ethylene."

[8] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

[9] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

[10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects of the NiO lattice. The substitution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice reduces the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. The multifunctional properties of niobium, such as its ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, enable it to fill cationic vacancies and substitute nickel atoms, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is responsible for the reduction of non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, which in turn reduces the unselective oxygen species and enhances ethane ODH activity. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts inversely correlates with the selectivity to ethylene. The less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO are more selective and convert ethane to ethylene. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene supports the above findings. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质,包括它们的各种稳定形态和氧化态,通过影响NiO晶格的非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷,影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌离子取代到NiO晶格中,减少了非选择性亲电氧自由基,从而增强了乙烷ODH活性。铌的多功能性质,如其离子半径、价态和电子供体性质,使其能够填充阳离子空位并取代镍原子,形成NiNb固溶体。这一取代过程负责减少非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷,从而减少非选择性氧物种,增强乙烷ODH活性。掺杂离子的价态越高,对所需产物的初始选择性越高。Ni基催化剂中容纳的非化学计量性氧与对乙烯的选择性成反比。高价态掺杂NiO的不移动氧物种更具选择性,将乙烷转化为乙烯。16O交换的表面速率与C2H6消耗的表面速率之间的线性关系证实了监测的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化机制中的积极作用。非化学计量性氧与选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间的明显相关性支持了上述发现。掺杂离子的价态越高,NiO晶格中的额外正电荷越高,导致氧物种减少,乙烯选择性提高。
