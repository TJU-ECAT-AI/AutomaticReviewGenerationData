[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."

[4] "The substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."

[5] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."

[6] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."

[7] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[8] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."

[9] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, can significantly influence the behavior of NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Depending on the valence of the dopant, the electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO can be increased or decreased, leading to changes in the activity of ethane ODH. The presence of niobium in the NiO lattice can reduce non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, resulting in fewer unselective oxygen species and enhanced ethane ODH activity. The higher the valence of the dopant cation, the higher the selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity. The correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene is clear, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion.

1.铌氧化物具有多种稳定形式和氧化态，可以显著影响NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为。根据掺杂剂的价态，NiO的亲电子氧自由基可以增加或减少，导致乙烷ODH活性的变化。铌在NiO晶格中的存在可以减少非化学计量性和阳离子缺陷，导致较少的非选择性氧物种和增强的乙烷ODH活性。掺杂剂阳离子的价态越高，对所需产物的初始选择性越高，其中NiNb表现出最高的选择性。催化剂容纳的非化学计量氧与选择性将乙烷转化为乙烯的能力之间存在明显的相关性，这两个值随着外来阳离子价态的增加而呈反比趋势。16O交换的表面速率与C2H6消耗的表面速率之间的线性关系证实了监测的氧物种在乙烷活化和转化机制中发挥的积极作用。
