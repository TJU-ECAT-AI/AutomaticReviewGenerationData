[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
[2] "Niobium was found to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."
[3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[5] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
[6] "The results of the XRD analysis support this notion. This substitution process also leads to charge imbalance due to the different valency of the nickel and niobium cations, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides, as discussed in detail later in the paper."
[7] "The highest proportion of this solid solution is obtained for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 compound, whereas segregation phenomena occur between Nb2O5 and NiO phases for Nb/Ni atomic ratios >0.176."
[8] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded. However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[9] "The introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicating modification of the catalysts and contributions from different species."
[10] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content."
[11] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
[12] "The application of these assumptions to the NiONb2O5 system explains the remarkable increase in acidity exhibited by the NiNbO catalysts compared to pure nickel oxide."
[13] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb."
[14] "Niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
[15] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
[16] "The introduction of Nb minimizes the nonstoichiometry of the material, fills the NiO cationic vacancies, and reduces the chemisorbed oxygen species on the catalytic surface."
[17] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."
