[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. Further increase of the niobium amount does not cause other alterations, and the lattice constant remains invariable."
[2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respec- tively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is pos- sible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[5] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
[6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conduc- tivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, have a significant impact on the behavior of NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a reduction in the lattice constant. This effect is observed up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, after which the lattice constant remains constant, indicating the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are similar, allowing for substitution between the two cations, which results in a reduction of the lattice constant. At high Nb loading, the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, leading to larger grain sizes. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, after which it decreases slightly for higher Nb content. This is due to the maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO being attained for this catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds. The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, leading to a reduction in the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb, reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and conductivity compared with pure NiO.

1.铌氧化物因其各种稳定形式和氧化态,对NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为有重大影响。将Nb掺入NiO晶格中会导致晶格收缩,导致晶格常数减小。这种效应在Nb/Ni比为0.176时观察到,之后晶格常数保持不变,表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。Ni2+和Nb5+的离子半径相似,允许两种离子之间的替代,导致晶格常数减小。在高Nb负载下,两个相(NiO和Nb2O5)开始分离,导致更大的晶粒尺寸。催化剂的酸性在Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂中达到最大值,之后对于更高的Nb含量略有下降。这是由于对于这种催化剂,NiO中铌离子的最大溶解度达到,证实观察到的酸性与NiONb键的形成有关。将Nb离子掺入NiO晶格中会降低p+浓度,导致表面可容纳的过剩氧量减少。在p型NiO晶格中溶解高氧化态阳离子(如Nb5+)表明Nb具有n掺杂特性,与纯NiO相比,降低了正空穴p+浓度和电导率。
