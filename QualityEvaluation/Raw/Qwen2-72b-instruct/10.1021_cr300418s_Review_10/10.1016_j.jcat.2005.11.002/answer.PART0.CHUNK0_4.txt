[1] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
[2] "Niobium was found to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."
[3] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
[4] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[5] "The XRD analysis shows that pure NiO crystallizes in the cubic rock salt structure with a lattice constant of a = 4.1762 Å, in agreement with reported data (JCPDS 4-835)."
[6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
[7] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene [15]."
[8] "Conclusively, the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the Ni NbO mixed oxides."

1.Niobium has been found to significantly enhance the reactivity of NiO catalysts towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), increasing the yield of ethene by over 50% while maintaining high selectivity. This improvement is attributed to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the activation of the CH bond by acting as an electron transfer promoter. The incorporation of niobium into the NiO lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, as evidenced by the decrease in lattice constant with increasing niobium content. However, there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice, which is reached at a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. Beyond this ratio, the lattice constant stabilizes, indicating saturation of the lattice sites. The cubic rock salt structure of pure NiO, with a lattice constant of 4.1762 Å, is disrupted by the incorporation of niobium, leading to a reduction in the lattice constant. This reduction in lattice constant is likely responsible for the enhanced reactivity and selectivity of the NiO catalysts towards ethane ODH. The incorporation of niobium into the NiO lattice also reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which are responsible for the accommodation of excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts. This reduction in excess oxygen correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, suggesting that the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by niobium doping is responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides. The challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems lies in understanding the intricate interplay between the lattice structure, electronic properties, and surface chemistry of the catalysts, which are influenced by the incorporation of niobium.

1.铌被发现能显著提高NiO催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)的反应性，使乙烯产量提高50%以上，同时保持高选择性。这种改进归因于铌能改善镍相的分散性，并通过充当电子转移促进剂来促进CH键的活化。将铌离子掺入NiO晶格中会导致晶格收缩，这从随着铌含量增加而减少的晶格常数中得到证实。然而，铌离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度存在上限，当Nb/Ni比为0.176时达到饱和。超过这个比例，晶格常数趋于稳定，表明晶格位点已饱和。纯NiO的立方岩盐结构，晶格常数为4.1762 Å，由于铌的掺入而被破坏，导致晶格常数减小。这种晶格常数的减小可能是NiO催化剂对乙烷ODH增强的反应性和选择性的原因。将铌掺入NiO晶格中也会降低正空穴(p+)的浓度，这些空穴负责Ni基催化剂表面过量氧气的吸附。过量氧气的减少与乙烯选择性呈反比，表明铌掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察相协调的挑战在于理解晶格结构、电子性质和催化剂表面化学之间的复杂相互作用，这些都受到铌掺入的影响。
