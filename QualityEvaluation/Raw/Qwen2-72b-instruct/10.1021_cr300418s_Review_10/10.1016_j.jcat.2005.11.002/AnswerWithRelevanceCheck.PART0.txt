          [1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
          [3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [4] "The introduction of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [5] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
          [8] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
          [9] "Niobium was found to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."
          [10] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [11] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [12] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded. However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [13] "The substitution process also leads to charge imbalance due to the different valency of the nickel and niobium cations, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides."
          [14] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content."
          [15] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [16] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [17] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [18] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
          [19] "The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."
          [20] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."

          Niobium oxides, when doped into NiO catalysts, significantly enhance the reactivity towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is due to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and act as an electron transfer promoter, facilitating the activation of the CH bond. The incorporation of niobium into the nickel oxide lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a certain Nb/Ni ratio. This indicates that there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium also inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. The substitution of niobium for nickel leads to a charge imbalance due to the different valencies of the two cations, significantly modifying the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for a specific Nb/Ni ratio and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst. The introduction of niobium ions into the NiO lattice reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments indicate that niobium consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species, suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

          铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂，对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的活性有显著增强，同时保持了高乙烯选择性。这是由于铌能够改善镍相的分散性，并作为电子转移促进剂，促进CH键的活化。铌被掺入镍氧化物晶格中，导致晶格收缩，晶格常数在一定Nb/Ni比下单调下降。这表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度存在上限。铌的掺入也抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。铌取代镍导致的电荷不平衡，由于两种离子的不同价态，显著改变了混合NiNbO氧化物的性质。催化剂的酸性在特定的Nb/Ni比下达到最大，然后随着Nb含量的增加而略有下降。观察到的酸性与NiONb键的形成有关，这被XRD数据证实，显示相同催化剂中铌离子在NiO中的最大溶解度。铌离子在NiO晶格中的引入减少了正空穴(p+)的浓度，这应该会减少表面可以容纳的过量氧的数量。Ni基催化剂表面的过量氧与乙烯选择性呈反比相关。铌作为电子供体，减少了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。O2-TPD实验表明，铌消耗或消除了未完全还原的亲电性氧物种，抑制了乙烷完全氧化为二氧化碳，增强了选择性转化为乙烯。由Nb掺杂引起的非化学计量氧的消除，很可能是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。
