1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium oxides can modify the electronic structure and surface properties of NiO, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. The introduction of niobium into NiO causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, which can be attributed to the substitution of Ni2+ ions by Nb5+ ions due to their similar ionic radii. This substitution process leads to charge imbalance and the formation of a NiNb solid solution, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded. However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2, and the introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicating modification of the catalysts and contributions from different species. The acidity of the NiNbO mixed oxides was determined by TPD after saturation of the catalytic surface with ammonia at 100 C, and the introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength. The Raman spectra of the NiNbO mixed oxides collected at ambient conditions show that the introduction of Nb in NiO results in the appearance of a weak broad band centered at 850 cm1, which becomes more intense and shifts to 840 cm1 for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. The electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide-based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on. The DC electrical conductivity of the NiNbO mixed oxides and of pure nickel and niobium oxide at room temperature is plotted as a function of the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, and doping of NiO with even the smallest amount of Nb causes a decrease in conductivity by more than an order of magnitude. The conductivity measurements point out that Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The effect of niobium on the surface oxygen species participating in the reaction and its enhancing action on the ethylene selectivity is further investigated and confirmed by transient experiments with isotopic 18O2, presented in part II of the present series. In addition, aspects of the mechanism and the ethane ODH reaction pathways occurring over this new class of catalytic materials are discussed, and a macroscopic kinetic model able to predict the catalyst performance for a wide range of operating conditions is developed. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems arise from the fact that the properties of the catalysts are influenced by various factors, including the electronic structure, surface properties, and the nature of the active sites. Theoretical predictions often assume idealized conditions, whereas experimental observations are influenced by the presence of defects, impurities, and the dynamic nature of the catalytic process. Moreover, the behavior of the catalysts can be influenced by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the reactants and products. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior of these materials requires a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质，包括它们的各种稳定形态和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为有显著影响。铌氧化物可以改变NiO的电子结构和表面性质，从而提高催化活性和选择性。铌的引入导致NiO晶格收缩，这可以归因于Nb5+离子替代Ni2+离子，因为它们的离子半径相似。这一替代过程导致电荷不平衡和NiNb固溶体的形成，这显著改变了混合NiNbO氧化物的性质。对于高Nb负载样品测量到的稳定NiO晶格常数表明，我们已经达到了Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中最大可能溶解度的上限。铌在镍氧化物晶格中的掺杂抑制了结晶，因此记录到较小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高Nb负载下，随着NiO和Nb2O5两相开始分离，NiO的结晶变得更加自由，导致检测到较大的晶体。催化剂的还原性通过H2中的TPR研究，铌的引入显著拓宽了还原曲线，表明催化剂的改性和来自不同物种的贡献。NiNbO混合氧化物的酸性通过在100°C下用氨饱和催化表面后的TPD确定，铌的引入导致总酸性显著增加，并产生弱和中等强度的新酸位点。在室温下，NiNbO混合氧化物和纯镍和铌氧化物的DC电导率作为Nb/Ni原子比的函数绘制，即使是最小量的Nb掺杂NiO也会导致电导率降低一个数量级以上。电导率测量表明，Nb掺杂导致电导率降低一倍，与p型宿主氧化物晶格中较高价离子溶解的受控价原理一致。因此，铌作为电子供体，降低了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。O2-TPD实验清楚地表明，Nb消耗或消除了未完全还原的亲电氧物种（例如，O、O2或O22），从而显著抑制了乙烷向二氧化碳的完全氧化，增强了向乙烯的有选择性转化。铌对参与反应的表面氧物种的影响及其对乙烯选择性的增强作用在本系列的第二部分中通过同位素18O2的瞬态实验进一步研究和证实。此外，讨论了这种新型催化材料上发生的乙烷ODH反应机制和反应途径，开发了一个宏观动力学模型，能够预测催化剂在广泛的操作条件下的性能。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察调和的挑战在于催化剂的性质受到多种因素的影响，包括电子结构、表面性质和活性位点的性质。理论预测通常假设理想化条件，而实验观察受到缺陷、杂质和催化过程动态性质的影响。此外，催化剂的行为可能受到反应条件的影响，如温度、压力和反应物和产物的组成。因此，要全面理解这些材料的催化行为，需要理论和实验方法的结合。
