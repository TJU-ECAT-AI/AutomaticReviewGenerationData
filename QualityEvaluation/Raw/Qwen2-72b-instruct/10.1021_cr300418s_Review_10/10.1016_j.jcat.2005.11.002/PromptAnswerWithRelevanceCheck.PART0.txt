[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. Further increase of the niobium amount does not cause other alterations, and the lattice constant remains invariable."
[2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respec- tively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is pos- sible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
[3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
[4] "The introduction of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice in- hibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
[5] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice con- stant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
[6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommo- date."
[7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conduc- tivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, have a significant impact on the behavior of NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The incorporation of Nb into the NiO lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a reduction in the lattice constant. This effect is observed up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176, after which the lattice constant remains constant, indicating the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are similar, allowing for substitution between the two cations, which results in a reduction of the lattice constant. At high Nb loading, the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, leading to larger grain sizes. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, after which it decreases slightly for higher Nb content. This is due to the maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO being attained for this catalyst, confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds. The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration, leading to a reduction in the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb, reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and conductivity compared with pure NiO.

1.铌氧化物因其各种稳定形式和氧化态,对NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为有重大影响。将Nb掺入NiO晶格中会导致晶格收缩,导致晶格常数减小。这种效应在Nb/Ni比为0.176时观察到,之后晶格常数保持不变,表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度。Ni2+和Nb5+的离子半径相似,允许两种离子之间的替代,导致晶格常数减小。在高Nb负载下,两个相(NiO和Nb2O5)开始分离,导致更大的晶粒尺寸。催化剂的酸性在Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂中达到最大值,之后对于更高的Nb含量略有下降。这是由于对于这种催化剂,NiO中铌离子的最大溶解度达到,证实观察到的酸性与NiONb键的形成有关。将Nb离子掺入NiO晶格中会降低p+浓度,导致表面可容纳的过剩氧量减少。在p型NiO晶格中溶解高氧化态阳离子(如Nb5+)表明Nb具有n掺杂特性,与纯NiO相比,降低了正空穴p+浓度和电导率。

The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst.

1.铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂，对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的活性有显著增强，同时保持了高乙烯选择性。这是由于铌能够改善镍相的分散性，并作为电子转移促进剂，促进CH键的活化。铌被掺入镍氧化物晶格中，导致晶格收缩，晶格常数在一定Nb/Ni比下单调下降。这表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度存在上限。铌的掺入也抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。铌取代镍导致的电荷不平衡，由于两种离子的不同价态，显著改变了混合NiNbO氧化物的性质。催化剂的酸性在特定的Nb/Ni比下达到最大，然后随着Nb含量的增加而略有下降。观察到的酸性与NiONb键的形成有关，这被XRD数据证实，显示相同催化剂中铌离子在NiO中的最大溶解度。铌离子在NiO晶格中的引入减少了正空穴(p+)的浓度，这应该会减少表面可以容纳的过量氧的数量。Ni基催化剂表面的过量氧与乙烯选择性呈反比相关。铌作为电子供体，减少了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。O2-TPD实验表明，铌消耗或消除了未完全还原的亲电性氧物种，抑制了乙烷完全氧化为二氧化碳，增强了选择性转化为乙烯。由Nb掺杂引起的非化学计量氧的消除，很可能是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。

1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium oxides can modify the electronic structure and surface properties of NiO, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. The introduction of niobium into NiO causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, which can be attributed to the substitution of Ni2+ ions by Nb5+ ions due to their similar ionic radii. This substitution process leads to charge imbalance and the formation of a NiNb solid solution, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded. However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals. The reducibility of the catalysts was studied with TPR in H2, and the introduction of Nb significantly broadens the reduction profiles, indicating modification of the catalysts and contributions from different species. The acidity of the NiNbO mixed oxides was determined by TPD after saturation of the catalytic surface with ammonia at 100 C, and the introduction of niobium causes a significant increase in the total acidity and generates new acid sites of weak and moderate strength. The Raman spectra of the NiNbO mixed oxides collected at ambient conditions show that the introduction of Nb in NiO results in the appearance of a weak broad band centered at 850 cm1, which becomes more intense and shifts to 840 cm1 for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst. The electrical conductivity measurements carried out on oxide-based catalysts can provide valuable information on the nature of structural defects, the existence of oxidizing species, and so on. The DC electrical conductivity of the NiNbO mixed oxides and of pure nickel and niobium oxide at room temperature is plotted as a function of the Nb/Ni atomic ratio, and doping of NiO with even the smallest amount of Nb causes a decrease in conductivity by more than an order of magnitude. The conductivity measurements point out that Nb incorporation causes a one-fold decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with the principle of controlled valence for dissolution of higher-valence ions in the lattice of p-type host oxide. Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The effect of niobium on the surface oxygen species participating in the reaction and its enhancing action on the ethylene selectivity is further investigated and confirmed by transient experiments with isotopic 18O2, presented in part II of the present series. In addition, aspects of the mechanism and the ethane ODH reaction pathways occurring over this new class of catalytic materials are discussed, and a macroscopic kinetic model able to predict the catalyst performance for a wide range of operating conditions is developed. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems arise from the fact that the properties of the catalysts are influenced by various factors, including the electronic structure, surface properties, and the nature of the active sites. Theoretical predictions often assume idealized conditions, whereas experimental observations are influenced by the presence of defects, impurities, and the dynamic nature of the catalytic process. Moreover, the behavior of the catalysts can be influenced by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the reactants and products. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior of these materials requires a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质，包括它们的各种稳定形态和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为掺杂剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的行为有显著影响。铌氧化物可以改变NiO的电子结构和表面性质，从而提高催化活性和选择性。铌的引入导致NiO晶格收缩，这可以归因于Nb5+离子替代Ni2+离子，因为它们的离子半径相似。这一替代过程导致电荷不平衡和NiNb固溶体的形成，这显著改变了混合NiNbO氧化物的性质。对于高Nb负载样品测量到的稳定NiO晶格常数表明，我们已经达到了Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中最大可能溶解度的上限。铌在镍氧化物晶格中的掺杂抑制了结晶，因此记录到较小的晶粒尺寸。然而，在高Nb负载下，随着NiO和Nb2O5两相开始分离，NiO的结晶变得更加自由，导致检测到较大的晶体。催化剂的还原性通过H2中的TPR研究，铌的引入显著拓宽了还原曲线，表明催化剂的改性和来自不同物种的贡献。NiNbO混合氧化物的酸性通过在100°C下用氨饱和催化表面后的TPD确定，铌的引入导致总酸性显著增加，并产生弱和中等强度的新酸位点。在室温下，NiNbO混合氧化物和纯镍和铌氧化物的DC电导率作为Nb/Ni原子比的函数绘制，即使是最小量的Nb掺杂NiO也会导致电导率降低一个数量级以上。电导率测量表明，Nb掺杂导致电导率降低一倍，与p型宿主氧化物晶格中较高价离子溶解的受控价原理一致。因此，铌作为电子供体，降低了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。O2-TPD实验清楚地表明，Nb消耗或消除了未完全还原的亲电氧物种（例如，O、O2或O22），从而显著抑制了乙烷向二氧化碳的完全氧化，增强了向乙烯的有选择性转化。铌对参与反应的表面氧物种的影响及其对乙烯选择性的增强作用在本系列的第二部分中通过同位素18O2的瞬态实验进一步研究和证实。此外，讨论了这种新型催化材料上发生的乙烷ODH反应机制和反应途径，开发了一个宏观动力学模型，能够预测催化剂在广泛的操作条件下的性能。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察调和的挑战在于催化剂的性质受到多种因素的影响，包括电子结构、表面性质和活性位点的性质。理论预测通常假设理想化条件，而实验观察受到缺陷、杂质和催化过程动态性质的影响。此外，催化剂的行为可能受到反应条件的影响，如温度、压力和反应物和产物的组成。因此，要全面理解这些材料的催化行为，需要理论和实验方法的结合。

1.Niobium has been found to significantly enhance the reactivity of NiO catalysts towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), increasing the yield of ethene by over 50% while maintaining high selectivity. This improvement is attributed to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the activation of the CH bond by acting as an electron transfer promoter. The incorporation of niobium into the NiO lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, as evidenced by the decrease in lattice constant with increasing niobium content. However, there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice, which is reached at a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176. Beyond this ratio, the lattice constant stabilizes, indicating saturation of the lattice sites. The cubic rock salt structure of pure NiO, with a lattice constant of 4.1762 Å, is disrupted by the incorporation of niobium, leading to a reduction in the lattice constant. This reduction in lattice constant is likely responsible for the enhanced reactivity and selectivity of the NiO catalysts towards ethane ODH. The incorporation of niobium into the NiO lattice also reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which are responsible for the accommodation of excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts. This reduction in excess oxygen correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene, suggesting that the elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by niobium doping is responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides. The challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems lies in understanding the intricate interplay between the lattice structure, electronic properties, and surface chemistry of the catalysts, which are influenced by the incorporation of niobium.

1.铌被发现能显著提高NiO催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)的反应性，使乙烯产量提高50%以上，同时保持高选择性。这种改进归因于铌能改善镍相的分散性，并通过充当电子转移促进剂来促进CH键的活化。将铌离子掺入NiO晶格中会导致晶格收缩，这从随着铌含量增加而减少的晶格常数中得到证实。然而，铌离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度存在上限，当Nb/Ni比为0.176时达到饱和。超过这个比例，晶格常数趋于稳定，表明晶格位点已饱和。纯NiO的立方岩盐结构，晶格常数为4.1762 Å，由于铌的掺入而被破坏，导致晶格常数减小。这种晶格常数的减小可能是NiO催化剂对乙烷ODH增强的反应性和选择性的原因。将铌掺入NiO晶格中也会降低正空穴(p+)的浓度，这些空穴负责Ni基催化剂表面过量氧气的吸附。过量氧气的减少与乙烯选择性呈反比，表明铌掺杂导致的非化学计量氧的消除是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察相协调的挑战在于理解晶格结构、电子性质和催化剂表面化学之间的复杂相互作用，这些都受到铌掺入的影响。
