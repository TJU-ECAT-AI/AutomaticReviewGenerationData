                    The diverse properties and oxidation states of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the catalytic sites become more active, reducing the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion, which increases ethylene selectivity. Beyond 15% Nb, the formation of the inactive NiNb2O6 phase leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb due to the reduction in active phase particle size, preventing sintering. However, all catalysts experience a continuous decrease in activity over time, attributed to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, leading to a lack of active Ospecies. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have been unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges in maintaining catalytic efficiency over extended periods \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing novel regeneration techniques for NiO catalysts doped with niobium oxides, aiming to overcome the deactivation challenges. Additionally, the optimization of preparation methods could lead to the discovery of more efficient catalysts with enhanced stability and activity. Theoretical models that accurately predict the behavior of niobium-doped NiO catalysts under ODH conditions would also be a valuable contribution, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Moreover, the exploration of niobium oxides with different oxidation states and their impact on catalytic performance could open new avenues for catalyst design, potentially leading to the development of more selective and stable catalysts for ethane ODH.

                    钽氧化物的多样性质和氧化态显著影响其在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)掺杂剂的行为\[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]。在低Nb含量下，最高可达3-7%，催化位点变得更加活跃，降低了乙烷转化的表观活化能和内在速率，从而提高了乙烯选择性。超过15%的Nb，形成不活跃的NiNb2O6相，导致催化活性下降。在15%的Nb时观察到最佳活性，这是由于活性相颗粒尺寸的减小，防止了烧结。然而，所有催化剂随时间的推移，活性持续下降，归因于NiNb2O6相的形成和NiO氧过量减少，导致活性O物种的缺乏。尝试再生催化剂均未成功，突显了在长时间内维持催化效率的挑战\[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]。
