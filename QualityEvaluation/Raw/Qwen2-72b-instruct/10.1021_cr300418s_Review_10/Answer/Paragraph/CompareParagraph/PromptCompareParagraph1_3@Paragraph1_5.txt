Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, significantly influence NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by reducing oxygen over-stoichiometry and electrophilic Ospecies concentration \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. At low Nb content (3-7%), the activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease, enhancing catalytic sites' activity but reducing their number, leading to increased ethylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Beyond 15% Nb, the inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, decreasing active phase content \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Optimal yields are observed at 15% Nb due to reduced active phase particle size, preventing sintering \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Long-term stability studies show deactivation attributed to NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry reduction and NiNb2O6 phase formation \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. The surface interaction between NiO and amorphous Nb2O5, influenced by the niobium precursor, is crucial for efficiency \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Theoretical predictions and experimental observations must reconcile the complex catalytic behavior \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore the intricate interplay between niobium oxides' properties and their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH. Future research endeavors might focus on developing a comprehensive model that bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, accounting for the complex behavior of these catalytic systems. This could involve advanced computational methods that accurately predict the formation of non-stoichiometric phases and their impact on catalytic activity. Additionally, innovative catalyst preparation techniques could be explored to optimize the interaction between NiO and amorphous Nb2O5, aiming to enhance long-term stability and prevent the formation of inactive phases.

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, significantly influence NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by altering redox properties, reducing NiO crystallite size, and inhibiting NiO reducibility \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. This leads to less active but more selective catalysts, where the Nb-rich phase covers unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species of NiO, enhancing selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. At optimal Nb content (3-4 at.%), catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. However, high Nb loadings cause significant deactivation due to the close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. The preparation method's impact on NbNiO nanocomposites suggests potential for improved NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. Reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in these complex systems presents challenges \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\].

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, enhance NiO catalysts for ethane ODH by reducing oxygen over-stoichiometry and electrophilic Ospecies concentration \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. At low Nb content (3-7%), the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease, enhancing ethylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Beyond 15% Nb, the inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, reducing active phase content \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. The optimal Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound yields the best results due to reduced active phase particle size, preventing sintering \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Over time, all catalysts deactivate due to NiNb2O6 phase formation and reduced oxygen over-stoichiometry, leading to a lack of active Ospecies \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Regeneration attempts have been unsuccessful \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\].

Niobium oxides, due to their ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, substitute nickel atoms in NiO catalysts, forming a NiNb solid solution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. This substitution reduces non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, decreasing unselective oxygen radicals and enhancing ethane ODH activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Higher dopant valence correlates with increased ethylene selectivity, as evidenced by NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The less mobile oxygen species in high valence doped NiO are more selective for ethane to ethylene conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The linear relationship between oxygen exchange and ethane consumption confirms the active role of oxygen species in ethane activation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The clear correlation between non-stoichiometric oxygen and ethylene selectivity supports these findings, with higher dopant valence leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\].

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. The stability of Nb2O5 and NbO, and the oxidation state of Nb in doped oxides, which can vary depending on its environment, affect reactivity \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base, impacting surface oxygen binding and hindering oxidation \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. In the presence of gas-phase oxygen, the system's behavior becomes complex \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts performance, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. Smaller particles in doped catalysts have more defects, enhancing chemical activity \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in surface oxygen reactivity \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\]. Doping generally improves catalytic activity, as shown by computations and experiments \[10.1021/cr300418s\_10\].

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, significantly impact their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Doping with niobium decreases activation energy and eliminates electrophilic oxygen species, favoring ethylene production over total ethane oxidation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. The ODH reaction on both oxides follows a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, but the replenishment of surface oxygen differs, affecting product distribution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. On NiO, rapid gaseous oxygen dissociation leads to high electrophilic oxygen concentrations, while niobium fills vacancies, reducing active sites and promoting diffusion, resulting in nucleophilic oxygen species selective for ethylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Challenges in studying these systems arise from the non-linear kinetic parameters and complex reaction networks, complicating the alignment of theoretical predictions with experimental data \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\].

Niobium-doped NiO catalysts boost ethane ODH reactivity and ethene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium improves nickel dispersion and CH bond activation, contracting the NiO lattice and reducing lattice constant up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium's incorporation inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, until high Nb loading promotes NiO crystallization \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Substitution of Ni2+ with Nb5+ causes charge imbalance, altering mixed NiNbO oxide properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Acidity peaks at a specific Nb/Ni ratio, correlating with NiONb bond formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium reduces p+ concentration, limiting excess oxygen on the surface, which inversely affects ethene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. As an electron donor, niobium reduces p+ holes in NiO, consuming electrophilic oxygen species and enhancing selective ethane conversion to ethene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more sophisticated computational models that can accurately predict the behavior of niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH. This could involve the integration of machine learning algorithms with traditional computational chemistry methods to better understand the complex interplay between niobium oxides' properties and catalyst behavior. Additionally, the design of novel catalyst preparation methods that can optimize the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites could lead to significant improvements in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH. The exploration of alternative dopants with similar properties to niobium, such as tantalum or titanium, could also provide new insights into the role of dopants in enhancing ethane ODH activity and selectivity. Furthermore, the development of advanced characterization techniques that can provide atomic-level surface information under reaction conditions could help bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Overall, the field of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation catalysis is ripe for innovation, and the study of niobium oxides as dopants in NiO catalysts presents a promising avenue for future research.
