Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, significantly influence NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by altering redox properties, reducing NiO crystallite size, and inhibiting NiO reducibility \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\].

Regeneration attempts have been unsuccessful \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\].

Niobium oxides, due to their ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, substitute nickel atoms in NiO catalysts, forming a NiNb solid solution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. This substitution reduces non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, decreasing unselective oxygen radicals and enhancing ethane ODH activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. Higher dopant valence correlates with increased ethylene selectivity, as evidenced by NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The less mobile oxygen species in high valence doped NiO are more selective for ethane to ethylene conversion \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The linear relationship between oxygen exchange and ethane consumption confirms the active role of oxygen species in ethane activation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\]. The clear correlation between non-stoichiometric oxygen and ethylene selectivity supports these findings, with higher dopant valence leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.12.004\].

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. The stability of Nb2O5 and NbO, and the oxidation state of Nb in doped oxides, which can vary depending on its environment, affect reactivity \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base, impacting surface oxygen binding and hindering oxidation \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. In the presence of gas-phase oxygen, the system's behavior becomes complex \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts performance, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. Smaller particles in doped catalysts have more defects, enhancing chemical activity \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in surface oxygen reactivity \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\]. Doping generally improves catalytic activity, as shown by computations and experiments \[10.1021/cr300418s_10\].

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties and oxidation states, significantly impact their role as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Doping with niobium decreases activation energy and eliminates electrophilic oxygen species, favoring ethylene production over total ethane oxidation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. The ODH reaction on both oxides follows a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, but the replenishment of surface oxygen differs, affecting product distribution \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. On NiO, rapid gaseous oxygen dissociation leads to high electrophilic oxygen concentrations, while niobium fills vacancies, reducing active sites and promoting diffusion, resulting in nucleophilic oxygen species selective for ethylene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\]. Challenges in studying these systems arise from the non-linear kinetic parameters and complex reaction networks, complicating the alignment of theoretical predictions with experimental data \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.003\].

Niobium-doped NiO catalysts boost ethane ODH reactivity and ethene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium improves nickel dispersion and CH bond activation, contracting the NiO lattice and reducing lattice constant up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium's incorporation inhibits crystallization, leading to smaller grain sizes, until high Nb loading promotes NiO crystallization \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Substitution of Ni2+ with Nb5+ causes charge imbalance, altering mixed NiNbO oxide properties \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Acidity peaks at a specific Nb/Ni ratio, correlating with NiONb bond formation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. Niobium reduces p+ concentration, limiting excess oxygen on the surface, which inversely affects ethene selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\]. As an electron donor, niobium reduces p+ holes in NiO, consuming electrophilic oxygen species and enhancing selective ethane conversion to ethene \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002\].

The diverse properties and oxidation states of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the catalytic sites become more active, reducing the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion, which increases ethylene selectivity. Beyond 15% Nb, the formation of the inactive NiNb2O6 phase leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. The optimal activity is observed at 15% Nb due to the reduction in active phase particle size, preventing sintering. However, all catalysts experience a continuous decrease in activity over time, attributed to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, leading to a lack of active Ospecies. Attempts to regenerate the catalysts have been unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges in maintaining catalytic efficiency over extended periods \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\].

The diverse properties and oxidation states of niobium oxides significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as elucidated in reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. At low Nb content (3-7%), the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease, enhancing catalytic sites' activity and ethylene selectivity. However, beyond 15% Nb, the inactive NiNb2O6 phase forms, reducing active phase content. The optimal Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound maximizes yields due to reduced active phase particle size. Long-term studies reveal a continuous decrease in activity, attributed to the formation of NiNb2O6 and reduced oxygen over-stoichiometry, leading to a lack of Oactive species. Catalyst regeneration attempts have been unsuccessful \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.10.004\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.015\] further elucidates that niobium oxides affect NiO catalysts for ethane ODH by altering redox properties, reducing NiO crystallite size, and inhibiting NiO reducibility, leading to less active but more selective catalysts. The Nb-rich phase covering unselective, non-stoichiometric active oxygen species of NiO is confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. At optimal Nb content (3-4 at.%), catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability. However, high Nb loadings cause significant deactivation due to the close interaction between NiO and the Nb-rich mixed oxide layer. The preparation method's impact on NbNiO nanocomposites suggests potential for further improvement in ethane ODH \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.10.005\]. The TPR profile of NiNb catalysts reveals two distinct reduction peaks at 335 and 510 C, indicating niobium's influence on the materials' reduction characteristics \[10.1016/j.jcat.2005.01.015\].

The design of model systems and calculations on surfaces with various defects could further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the enhanced catalytic activity of doped oxides. Moreover, the exploration of regeneration strategies for spent catalysts could address the challenge of continuous deactivation over time, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable catalytic processes for ethane ODH.
