[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."



[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."
          [3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."
          [4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [5] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."
          [6] "The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to ethylene [17,35]."
          [7] "The increase in ethylene selectivity with increasing dopant valence in the NiMeO mixed oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert ethane to ethylene."
          [8] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
          [9] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
          [10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
          [2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
          [3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
          [4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
          [5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
          [7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
          [8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
          [9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
          [10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
          [11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
          [12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
          [13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
          [14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
          [15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
          [16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
          [17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
          [18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
          [19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
          [20] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
          [21] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
          [22] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
          [23] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
          [24] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
          [25] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
          [26] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide? With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
          [27] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
          [28] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."
          [29] "The work performed so far is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results obtained are promising and much remains to be done."
          [30] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
          [31] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
          [32] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
          [33] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen."
          [34] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
          [35] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
          [36] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
          [37] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."



[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
          [3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [4] "The introduction of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [5] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
          [8] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
          [9] "Niobium was found to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."
          [10] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."

          [13] "The substitution process also leads to charge imbalance due to the different valency of the nickel and niobium cations, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides."
          [14] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content."

          [18] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
          [19] "The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."
          [20] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."

          [18] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
          [19] "The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."
          [20] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."



[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."



[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."
          [3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."
          [4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [5] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."
          [6] "The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to ethylene [17,35]."
          [7] "The increase in ethylene selectivity with increasing dopant valence in the NiMeO mixed oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert ethane to ethylene."
          [8] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
          [9] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
          [10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
          [2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
          [3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
          [4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
          [5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
          [7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
          [8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
          [9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
          [10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
          [11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
          [12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
          [13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
          [14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
          [15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
          [16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
          [17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
          [18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
          [19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
          [20] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
          [21] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
          [22] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
          [23] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
          [24] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
          [25] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
          [26] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide? With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
          [27] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
          [28] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."
          [29] "The work performed so far is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results obtained are promising and much remains to be done."
          [30] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
          [31] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
          [32] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
          [33] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen."
          [34] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
          [35] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
          [36] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
          [37] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."



[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
          [3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [4] "The introduction of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded.However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [5] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
          [8] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
          [9] "Niobium was found to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and facilitate the CH bond activation by acting as an electron transfer promoter."

          [13] "The substitution process also leads to charge imbalance due to the different valency of the nickel and niobium cations, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides."
          [14] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content."
          [15] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [16] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [17] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [18] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
          [19] "The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."
          [20] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."



[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."



[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."
          [3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."
          [4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [5] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."
          [6] "The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to ethylene [17,35]."
          [7] "The increase in ethylene selectivity with increasing dopant valence in the NiMeO mixed oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert ethane to ethylene."
          [8] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
          [9] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
          [10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
          [2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
          [3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
          [4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
          [5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
          [7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
          [8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
          [9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
          [10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
          [11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
          [12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
          [13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
          [14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
          [15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
          [16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
          [17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
          [18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
          [19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
          [20] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
          [21] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
          [22] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
          [23] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
          [24] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
          [25] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
          [26] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide? With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
          [27] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
          [28] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."
          [29] "The work performed so far is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results obtained are promising and much remains to be done."
          [30] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
          [31] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
          [32] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
          [33] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen."
          [34] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
          [35] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
          [36] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
          [37] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."



[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
          [3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."

          [7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
          [8] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."

          [10] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [11] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."
          [12] "The incorporation of niobium in the nickel oxide lattice inhibits crystallization, and thus smaller grain sizes are recorded. However, at high Nb loading and as the two phases (NiO and Nb2O5) begin to segregate, crystallization of NiO occurs more freely, leading to the detection of larger crystals."
          [13] "The substitution process also leads to charge imbalance due to the different valency of the nickel and niobium cations, which significantly modifies the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides."
          [14] "The acidity reaches a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content."
          [15] "The XRD data indicate, based on the calculated NiO lattice constant, that maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO is attained for the same catalyst (Ni0.85Nb0.15), confirming that the observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds."
          [16] "The introduction of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [17] "The excess oxygen accommodated on the surface of Ni-based catalysts reportedly correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene."
          [18] "Niobium, therefore, acts as an electron donor and reduces the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor."
          [19] "The O2-TPD experiments clearly indicate that Nb consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species (e.g., O, O2, or O22), thus significantly suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene."
          [20] "The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is very likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides."



[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."



[1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

[1] "Depending on the valence of the foreign species, the dopants can increase or decrease the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals of NiO, leading to, respectively, reduced or enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [2] "The enhanced catalytic activity of the proposed mixed oxides was related to the presence of a multifunctional Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) orthorhombic phase [8]."
          [3] "Detailed structural and isotopic kinetic characterization of the materials showed that due to the favorable ionic radii, valence and electron-donor properties of niobium, Nb cations fill the cationic vacancies and/or substitute nickel atoms in the NiO lattice, forming a NiNb solid solution [14,15]."
          [4] "This substitution process is most likely responsible for the reduction of the non-stoichiometry and the cationic defects and, consequently, of the unselective oxygen species, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity."
          [5] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher is the initial selectivity to the desired product, with NiNb exhibiting the highest selectivity (90%) and NiLi the lowest (19%)."
          [6] "The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts has been also previously reported to inversely correlate with the selectivity to ethylene [17,35]."
          [7] "The increase in ethylene selectivity with increasing dopant valence in the NiMeO mixed oxides can also be related to the less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO, which appear to be more selective and convert ethane to ethylene."
          [8] "The linear relationship established between the surface rate of 16O exchange in the TPIE experiments and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption in the ODH activity tests confirms that the monitored oxygen species do participate and play an active role in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion."
          [9] "The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen that catalysts accommodate and the ability to selectively convert the ethane substrate to ethylene, with these two values following an inverse trend with increasing foreign cation valence, strongly supports the above."
          [10] "The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, and therefore the lower the oxygen species and the higher the ethylene selectivity, as clearly demonstrated by the presented data in this work."

[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
          [2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
          [3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
          [4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
          [5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
          [6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
          [7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
          [8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
          [9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
          [10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
          [11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
          [12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
          [13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
          [14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
          [15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
          [16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
          [17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
          [18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
          [19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
          [20] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
          [21] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
          [22] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
          [23] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
          [24] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
          [25] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
          [26] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide? With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
          [27] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
          [28] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."
          [29] "The work performed so far is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results obtained are promising and much remains to be done."
          [30] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
          [31] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
          [32] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
          [33] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen."
          [34] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
          [35] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
          [36] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
          [37] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."



[1] "The incorporation of Nb causes a contraction of the NiO lattice, as evidenced by the monotonous decrease of the lattice constant with increasing Nb content (Table 1) up to a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176."
          [2] "The substitution process requires that the ionic radii of host and foreign cations be similar. The ionic radii of Ni2+ and Nb5+ are 0.69 Å [20] and 0.64 Å, respectively; therefore, a substitution between the two cations is possible and would lead to a reduction of the lattice constant, since the radii of Nb5+ is smaller than that of Ni2+."
          [3] "The stable NiO lattice constant measured for the high-Nb loading samples (Ni0.8Nb0.2, Ni0.7Nb0.3, and Ni0.6Nb0.4) indicates that we have reached an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice."

          [6] "The incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice reduces the p+ concentration and thus should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate."
          [7] "The dissolution of higher valence cations, such as Nb5+, in the p-type NiO lattice suggests an n-doping character of Nb. Niobium oxide is an n-type semiconductor with nonstoichiometry arising from a lack of oxygen ions and free electrons as main charge carriers. Therefore, niobium acts as a donor of electrons and fills the electron (hole) states on Ni, thereby reducing the positive hole p+ concentration and, consequently, the conductivity compared with pure NiO, consistent with our results."
          [8] "The introduction of niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by >50% while maintaining the high ethene selectivity, resulting in a 30% ethene yield at 425 C."
