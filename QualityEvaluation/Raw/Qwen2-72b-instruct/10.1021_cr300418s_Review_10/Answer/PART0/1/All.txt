At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease. The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO. The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to this surface interaction. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature.

At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant.

The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time.

The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate.

The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen.

The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature.

The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant.

The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time.

The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate.

The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen.

The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature.

This is due to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and act as an electron transfer promoter, facilitating the activation of the CH bond. The incorporation of niobium into the nickel oxide lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a certain Nb/Ni ratio. This indicates that there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium also inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. The substitution of niobium for nickel leads to a charge imbalance due to the different valencies of the two cations, significantly modifying the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for a specific Nb/Ni ratio and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst. The introduction of niobium ions into the NiO lattice reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments indicate that niobium consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species, suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.", "Chinese": "铌氧化物作为NiO催化剂的掺杂剂，对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的活性有显著增强，同时保持了高乙烯选择性。这是由于铌能够改善镍相的分散性，并作为电子转移促进剂，促进CH键的活化。铌被掺入镍氧化物晶格中，导致晶格收缩，晶格常数在一定Nb/Ni比下单调下降。这表明Nb5+离子在NiO晶格中的最大可能溶解度存在上限。铌的掺入也抑制了结晶，导致更小的晶粒尺寸。铌取代镍导致的电荷不平衡，由于两种离子的不同价态，显著改变了混合NiNbO氧化物的性质。催化剂的酸性在特定的Nb/Ni比下达到最大，然后随着Nb含量的增加而略有下降。观察到的酸性与NiONb键的形成有关，这被XRD数据证实，显示相同催化剂中铌离子在NiO中的最大溶解度。铌离子在NiO晶格中的引入减少了正空穴(p+)的浓度，这应该会减少表面可以容纳的过量氧的数量。Ni基催化剂表面的过量氧与乙烯选择性呈反比相关。铌作为电子供体，减少了NiO受体的正p+空穴浓度。O2-TPD实验表明，铌消耗或消除了未完全还原的亲电性氧物种，抑制了乙烷完全氧化为二氧化碳，增强了选择性转化为乙烯。由Nb掺杂引起的非化学计量氧的消除，很可能是NiNbO混合氧化物表现出高乙烯选择性的原因。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.002"},
