The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reducing the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the electrophilic Ospecies concentration. At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease. The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO. The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to this surface interaction. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties, surface area, and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of niobium in the NiO catalysts limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The geometric effect of the niobium-rich phase covering part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface. However, the occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, and the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst is due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the properties of niobium oxides and the behavior of the catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that the introduction of niobium significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity. The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C, indicating that niobium affects the reduction characteristics of the materials.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reacting with the cationic vacancies in NiO to form two distinct structural phases: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the formation of non-stoichiometric oxidic phases with characteristic structural defects in low-temperature treated NiO, which are not always predictable or consistent with theoretical models.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects of the NiO lattice. The substitution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice reduces the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. The multifunctional properties of niobium, such as its ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, enable it to fill cationic vacancies and substitute nickel atoms, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is responsible for the reduction of non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, which in turn reduces the unselective oxygen species and enhances ethane ODH activity. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts inversely correlates with the selectivity to ethylene. The less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO are more selective and convert ethane to ethylene. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene supports the above findings. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate. To bridge the gap between models and experiments, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are also necessary. Due to uncertainties, computations should be used mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of oxides, as shown by both computations and experiments. The interactions between Lewis acids and bases in surface chemistry have been explained by computations, which can be useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, although they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers. The work on doped oxides is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results are promising, and much remains to be done.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the non-linear behavior of the kinetic parameters and the complexity of the reaction network.

Niobium oxides, when doped into NiO catalysts, significantly enhance the reactivity towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is due to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and act as an electron transfer promoter, facilitating the activation of the CH bond. The incorporation of niobium into the nickel oxide lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a certain Nb/Ni ratio. This indicates that there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium also inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. The substitution of niobium for nickel leads to a charge imbalance due to the different valencies of the two cations, significantly modifying the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for a specific Nb/Ni ratio and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst. The introduction of niobium ions into the NiO lattice reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments indicate that niobium consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species, suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the non-linear behavior of the kinetic parameters and the complexity of the reaction network.

Niobium oxides, when doped into NiO catalysts, significantly enhance the reactivity towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is due to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and act as an electron transfer promoter, facilitating the activation of the CH bond. The incorporation of niobium into the nickel oxide lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a certain Nb/Ni ratio. This indicates that there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium also inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. The substitution of niobium for nickel leads to a charge imbalance due to the different valencies of the two cations, significantly modifying the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for a specific Nb/Ni ratio and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst. The introduction of niobium ions into the NiO lattice reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments indicate that niobium consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species, suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reducing the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the electrophilic Ospecies concentration. At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease. The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO. The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to this surface interaction. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties, surface area, and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of niobium in the NiO catalysts limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The geometric effect of the niobium-rich phase covering part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface. However, the occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, and the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst is due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the properties of niobium oxides and the behavior of the catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that the introduction of niobium significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity. The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C, indicating that niobium affects the reduction characteristics of the materials.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reacting with the cationic vacancies in NiO to form two distinct structural phases: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the formation of non-stoichiometric oxidic phases with characteristic structural defects in low-temperature treated NiO, which are not always predictable or consistent with theoretical models.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects of the NiO lattice. The substitution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice reduces the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. The multifunctional properties of niobium, such as its ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, enable it to fill cationic vacancies and substitute nickel atoms, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is responsible for the reduction of non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, which in turn reduces the unselective oxygen species and enhances ethane ODH activity. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts inversely correlates with the selectivity to ethylene. The less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO are more selective and convert ethane to ethylene. The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene supports the above findings. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate. To bridge the gap between models and experiments, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are also necessary. Due to uncertainties, computations should be used mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of oxides, as shown by both computations and experiments. The interactions between Lewis acids and bases in surface chemistry have been explained by computations, which can be useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, although they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers. The work on doped oxides is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results are promising, and much remains to be done.

The linear relationship between the surface rate of 16O exchange and the surface rate of C2H6 consumption confirms the active role of the monitored oxygen species in the mechanism of ethane activation and conversion. The clear correlation between the non-stoichiometric oxygen and the ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene supports the above findings. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the extra positive charge in the NiO lattice, leading to lower oxygen species and higher ethylene selectivity.

Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate. To bridge the gap between models and experiments, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are also necessary. Due to uncertainties, computations should be used mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of oxides, as shown by both computations and experiments. The interactions between Lewis acids and bases in surface chemistry have been explained by computations, which can be useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, although they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers. The work on doped oxides is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results are promising, and much remains to be done.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the non-linear behavior of the kinetic parameters and the complexity of the reaction network.

Niobium oxides, when doped into NiO catalysts, significantly enhance the reactivity towards ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) while maintaining high ethene selectivity. This is due to niobium's ability to improve the dispersion of the nickel phase and act as an electron transfer promoter, facilitating the activation of the CH bond. The incorporation of niobium into the nickel oxide lattice causes a contraction of the lattice, leading to a decrease in the lattice constant up to a certain Nb/Ni ratio. This indicates that there is an upper limit to the maximum possible dissolution of Nb5+ cations into the NiO lattice. The incorporation of niobium also inhibits crystallization, resulting in smaller grain sizes. The substitution of niobium for nickel leads to a charge imbalance due to the different valencies of the two cations, significantly modifying the properties of the mixed NiNbO oxides. The acidity of the catalysts reaches a maximum for a specific Nb/Ni ratio and then decreases slightly for higher Nb content. The observed acidity is related to the formation of NiONb bonds, which is confirmed by the XRD data showing maximum solubility of niobium cations in NiO for the same catalyst. The introduction of niobium ions into the NiO lattice reduces the concentration of positive holes (p+), which should reduce the amount of excess oxygen that the surface can accommodate. The excess oxygen on the surface of Ni-based catalysts correlates inversely with the selectivity to ethylene. Niobium acts as an electron donor, reducing the positive p+ hole concentration of the NiO acceptor. The O2-TPD experiments indicate that niobium consumes or eliminates the incompletely reduced electrophilic oxygen species, suppressing the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide and enhancing the selective conversion to ethylene. The elimination of nonstoichiometric oxygen caused by Nb doping is likely responsible for the high ethene selectivity exhibited by the NiNbO mixed oxides.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reducing the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the electrophilic Ospecies concentration. At low Nb content, up to 3-7%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously, which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In parallel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectivity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease. The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A continuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO. The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to this surface interaction. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties, surface area, and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of niobium in the NiO catalysts limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The geometric effect of the niobium-rich phase covering part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface. However, the occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, and the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst is due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the properties of niobium oxides and the behavior of the catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that the introduction of niobium significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity. The TPR profile of the NiNb catalyst presents two distinct reduction peaks with maxima at 335 and 510 C, indicating that niobium affects the reduction characteristics of the materials.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reacting with the cationic vacancies in NiO to form two distinct structural phases: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the formation of non-stoichiometric oxidic phases with characteristic structural defects in low-temperature treated NiO, which are not always predictable or consistent with theoretical models.

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the non-stoichiometry and cationic defects of the NiO lattice. The substitution of niobium cations into the NiO lattice reduces the unselective electrophilic oxygen radicals, leading to enhanced ethane ODH activity. The multifunctional properties of niobium, such as its ionic radii, valence, and electron-donor properties, enable it to fill cationic vacancies and substitute nickel atoms, forming a NiNb solid solution. This substitution process is responsible for the reduction of non-stoichiometry and cationic defects, which in turn reduces the unselective oxygen species and enhances ethane ODH activity. The higher the dopant cations valence, the higher the initial selectivity to the desired product. The non-stoichiometric oxygen accommodated in the Ni-based catalysts inversely correlates with the selectivity to ethylene. The less mobile oxygen species of high valence doped NiO are more selective and convert ethane to ethylene.
