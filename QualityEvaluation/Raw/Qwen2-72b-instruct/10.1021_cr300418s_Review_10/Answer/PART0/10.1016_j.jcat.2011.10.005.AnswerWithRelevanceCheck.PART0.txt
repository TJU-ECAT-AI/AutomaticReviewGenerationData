          [1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties, surface area, and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of niobium in the NiO catalysts limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The geometric effect of the niobium-rich phase covering part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface. However, the occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, and the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst is due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the properties of niobium oxides and the behavior of the catalysts.

          铌氧化物的多样性质,包括其各种稳定形式和氧化态,通过影响催化剂的氧化还原性质、表面积和选择性,影响其在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌在NiO催化剂中的存在限制了NiO晶粒的大小,抑制了NiO的还原性,导致了对乙烷氧化脱氢反应活性较低但选择性较高的催化剂。铌富集相的几何效应,即覆盖NiO的部分非选择性、非化学计量的活性氧物种,得到了高分辨率透射电子显微镜观察的支持。铌通过填充阳离子空位,减少了氧气解离的活性位点的数量,这增强了非选择性、亲电性O氧物种在体相中的扩散,并增加了催化剂表面较少可移动、更具选择性的O2氧物种的数量。然而,结构掺杂的发生仅限于Nb的几个百分点,而Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225催化剂的优越性是由于存在一个覆盖部分NiO晶粒表面的富铌无定形氧化物相,从而覆盖了部分非选择性、活性氧位点。NiO与薄的Nb富集混合氧化层之间的紧密相互作用,加上在ODH条件下可能的纳米复合材料重构,导致在高Nb负载下催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的ODH催化剂是那些含有3-4 at.% Nb的催化剂,它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明,通过优化催化剂,可以预期NiO催化乙烷ODH的进一步改进。然而,在研究这些复杂的催化系统时,由于铌氧化物的性质与催化剂行为之间的复杂相互作用,将理论预测与实验观察相协调存在挑战。
