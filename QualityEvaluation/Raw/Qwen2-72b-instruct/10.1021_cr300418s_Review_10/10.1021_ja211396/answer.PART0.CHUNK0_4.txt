1.The literature does not provide information on niobium oxides, their stable forms, oxidation states, or their influence as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the effects of Li/Mo codoping of CaO films on the equilibrium shape of Au deposits, and does not address the complexities of reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations in the context of niobium-doped NiO catalysts.
