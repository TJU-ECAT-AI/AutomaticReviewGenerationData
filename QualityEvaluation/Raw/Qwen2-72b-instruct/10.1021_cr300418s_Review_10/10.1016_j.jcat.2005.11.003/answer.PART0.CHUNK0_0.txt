1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质,包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态,对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。发现铌掺杂显著降低了标记氧的活化能和交换率,表明消除了非化学计量的亲电活性氧物种,这些物种负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2。两种氧化物上的乙烷ODH反应均通过Marsvan Krevelen机制进行,参与催化剂氧。然而,两种氧化物补充表面氧的途径不同,导致表面存在不同的氧物种,从而导致在乙烷ODH反应中观察到的产品分布不同。在NiO上,补充通过在阳离子空位上快速解离气态氧,而掺入和扩散较慢,因此在表面形成大量亲电氧物种。铌填充了阳离子空位,减少了可用于解离的活性位点,从而使扩散成为过程的快速步骤。因此,在催化剂表面上大量存在强烈结合的、不易移动的亲核氧物种,这些物种选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯。
