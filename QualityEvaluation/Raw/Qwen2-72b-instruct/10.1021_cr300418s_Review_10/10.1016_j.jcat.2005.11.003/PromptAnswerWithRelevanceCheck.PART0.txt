1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium doping was found to significantly decrease the activation energy and exchange rate of labeled oxygen, indicating the elimination of nonstoichiometric electrophilic active oxygen species, responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The ethane ODH reaction proceeds on both oxides via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with the participation of catalyst oxygen. However, the route for replenishing surface oxygen differs between the two oxides, leading to different oxygen species on the surface and consequently to the different product distribution observed in the ethane ODH reaction. On NiO, replenishment occurs by rapid dissociation of gaseous oxygen on the cation vacancies with slower incorporation and diffusion, hence leading to large concentrations of electrophilic oxygen species on the surface. Niobium fills the cationic vacancies and reduces the active sites available for dissociation, thus making diffusion the fast step of the process. Therefore, strongly bonded, less labile nucleophilic oxygen species, selective for converting ethane to ethylene, are abundant on the catalyst surface.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质,包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态,对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。发现铌掺杂显著降低了标记氧的活化能和交换率,表明消除了非化学计量的亲电活性氧物种,这些物种负责将乙烷完全氧化为CO2。两种氧化物上的乙烷ODH反应均通过Marsvan Krevelen机制进行,参与催化剂氧。然而,两种氧化物补充表面氧的途径不同,导致表面存在不同的氧物种,从而导致在乙烷ODH反应中观察到的产品分布不同。在NiO上,补充通过在阳离子空位上快速解离气态氧,而掺入和扩散较慢,因此在表面形成大量亲电氧物种。铌填充了阳离子空位,减少了可用于解离的活性位点,从而使扩散成为过程的快速步骤。因此,在催化剂表面上大量存在强烈结合的、不易移动的亲核氧物种,这些物种选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯。

1.The literature does not provide specific details on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that doping NiO with Nb leads to the formation of a NiNb solid solution, which effectively converts NiO from a total oxidation catalyst to an efficient ODH catalytic material. The optimum incorporation of Nb ions in the NiO lattice was achieved for a Nb/Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst), resulting in high activity at low temperature and high ethene selectivity at high conversion levels. Niobium affects the selectivity to olefin by modifying the oxygen species on the catalytic surface. The introduction of Nb induces a significant increase in the activation energy for oxygen exchange up to 175.6 kJ/mol, reflecting more strongly bonded oxygen species on Nb/NiO compared with pure NiO. Doping with Nb reduces or eliminates the very active nonselective Ospecies on the surface of NiO by reducing the active sites for rapid oxygen dissociation on the surface. This leads to the formation of less labile selective lattice O2species, responsible for the high ODH activity recorded over the NiNbO mixed oxide.

1.文献没有提供铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，如何影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为的具体细节。然而，它确实提到，用Nb掺杂NiO会导致NiNb固溶体的形成，这有效地将NiO从一个完全氧化催化剂转化为一个有效的ODH催化材料。在Nb/Ni比为0.176（Ni0.85Nb0.15催化剂）时，Nb离子在NiO晶格中的最优掺入导致在低温下具有高活性，在高转化率下具有高乙烯选择性。铌通过改变催化表面的氧物种来影响烯烃的选择性。Nb的引入导致氧交换的活化能显著增加到175.6 kJ/mol，这反映了Nb/NiO上与纯NiO相比更强烈结合的氧物种。用Nb掺杂通过减少表面快速氧解离的活性位点，消除了NiO表面上非常活跃的非选择性O物种。这导致了较少可移动的、选择性的晶格O2物种的形成，这些物种对NiNbO混合氧化物上记录的高ODH活性负责。
