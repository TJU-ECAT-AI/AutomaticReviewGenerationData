1. Introduction
Perovskite-type mixed metal oxides have demonstrated high
potential as catalysts, specially in the depollution of exhaust gases
[1–5]. These solids have a well-deﬁned crystalline structure
represented by the general formula ABO3, where A designates a
cation of rare-earth, alkaline earth, alkali or ions with a large ionic
radius, like Pb2+ or Bi3+ and B a transition metal cation from the
groups 3d, 4d or 5d [6–10]. The formation of complex mixed oxides
from the partial substitutions on A- and/or B-sites are possible and
can generate a
large variety
of
compounds with
different
compositions [11–15].
Such
wide
ﬂexibility
of
metal
composition
is
of
great
importance for heterogeneous catalysis since the substitution of
A- and/or B-sites by other cations is accompanied by hard
modiﬁcations of the catalytic properties of the material [16–18].
In addition, advantages such as their easy synthesis, low cost and
high thermal stability determine and justify the special interest
raised by these materials in the last decades [19–21].
Since
the
1970s,
perovskites
are
reported
as
promising
substitutes for noble metal based catalysts (in particular of
palladium, platinum and rhodium), whose use for the exhaust
gas cleaning is predominant nowadays [22–25]. However, the low
speciﬁc surface areas of perovskites (<10 m2/g) prepared by
conventional synthesis routes, limit their efﬁciency in catalytic
processes [26–28]. In the last decades, great efforts have been done
to obtain perovskites with increased speciﬁc surface area. Never-
theless, because the synthesis of perovskites is carried out through
reactions, which occur in the solid state at high temperatures, the
preparation of such binary, ternary or multinary oxides with high
speciﬁc surface area is often difﬁcult. As known, in such conditions
severe sintering occurs, producing large particles with low speciﬁc
surface area [29], while lower calcination temperatures lead to
other phases besides perovskite [27].
Several preparation methods, as micro-emulsion, sol–gel,
spray-drying, freeze-drying, citrate complexation, ﬂame-hydro-
lysis and coprecipitation were attempted in order to reduce the
disadvantages of conventional perovskite synthesis
[30–36].
Usually, these methods need great amounts of organic liquids,

LaFe1xCoxO3 perovskites were conventionally or nanocasting synthesized. The nanocasting involved the
preparation of a micro-mesoporous carbon mould using a Silica Aerosil 200 and a carbon source. Then,
perovskites were carbon cast at 800 8C. The solids were characterized by XRD, N2 sorption, FTIR, TGA/
DTG, SEM and TEM. N2 sorption evidenced that the nanocast perovskites did not show signiﬁcant
intraparticle porosity in despite of their enhanced (30–50 m2/g) speciﬁc surface area (SSA). Nevertheless,
TEM images, XRD and Rietveld reﬁnement data showed that the solids are constituted at least by 97 wt%
of perovskite phase and by agglomerates smaller than 100 nm constituted by crystallites of about 6 nm.
TGA/DTG results demonstrated carbon oxidation during the perovskite formation, thus eliminating the
template effect and facilitating the occurrence of sintering, which limited the SSA increase. The nanocast
perovskites were more active in the reduction of NO than the uncast ones, behavior that was attributed
to the increase in their SSA that allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites.
However, the perovskite composition and the presence of impurities can reduce the effect of the
improvement of the textural properties. The nanocast perovskites also showed high thermal and
catalytic stability, corroborating their potential as catalysts for the studied reaction.

expensive reagents and/or precursors, besides to a complex and
multi-step preparation sequences. Recently, some works related
with the synthesis of inorganic compounds with improved textural
properties have shown that these inconveniences may be over-
come using the nanocasting technique [37–40].
As described by Valde
´s-Solı
´s and Fuertes [41] in a recent review
article, in the preparation of inorganic compounds by nanocasting,
the materials are formed inside nanospaces provided by the empty
space (i.e., pore channels) of a porous solid (hard template). After
the synthesis of the nanocast material, the template is selectively
removed and the inorganic product is obtained. Ideally, the used
hard template must have an interconnected pore channels, thus
the pore structure of the resulting nanocast solid should be an
inverse replica of that template [42].
In this work we prepared perovskites with high speciﬁc surface
areasusingthenanocastingtechnique.NanosizedsolidswithLaFeO3
and LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 nominal compositions were synthesized using a
porous carbon as hard template, which was obtained using Silica
Aerosil 200 as cast. In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of the
obtained perovskites, the environmentally relevant reduction of NO
to N2 using CO as reduction agent (Eq. (1)) was used as test reaction.

(1)
Also the oxidation of CO to CO2 was veriﬁed. The reaction of NO
with CO is very convenient since both reactants are undesirable
pollutants and very common components in exhaust gases of
mobile and stationary sources [43–45]. Finally, the catalytic
activity of the perovskites prepared by nanocasting was compared
with
similar
samples
obtained
by
the
conventional
citrate
complexation method.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of perovskites by a conventional method
Typical LaFe1xCoxO3 (x = 0 or 0.4) perovskites were prepared
by the citrate method [46], using salts of La(NO3)36H2O (Fluka,
99.0%), Co(NO3)26H2O (Riedel-de Hae
¨n, 99.0%) and Fe(NO3)39H2O
(97.0%) as inorganic precursors. In this conventional preparation,
stoichiometric amounts of the nitrate salts were mixed and
dissolved in deionised water. Then, equimolar amounts of citric
acid (Vetec, 95.0%) and ethylene glycol (Synth, 99.5%) were added
and the solution stirred at room temperature for 5 min. The excess
of water in the mixture was evaporated in an oven at 60 8C for 20 h.
The resulting powder was grounded and then calcined under air
ﬂow in two heating steps: 550 8C for 3 h and 800 8C for 5 h (heating
rate of 4 8C min1).
2.2. Preparation of the porous carbon
The porous carbon was prepared following a slightly modiﬁed
method published by Yu et al. [47]. Pyrogenic Silica Aerosil 200
(Degussa), which consists of aggregated silica spheres with mean
diameters of 12 nm [48], was used as hard template. Firstly, Aerosil
200 was mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of sucrose
(66 wt%), containing 0.1 g H2SO4 g1 of sucrose, and then kneaded
with a spatula in order to obtain a uniform mixture. After drying in
air overnight at room temperature and subsequently treated at
100 8C for 5 h (heating rate 1 8C min1), the sucrose was carbonized
under nitrogen atmosphere at 800 8C for 5 h (heating rate
1 8C min1). Finally, the silica was removed by dissolution with
hydroﬂuoric acid (40 wt%). The resulting carbon, denominated as
CAEROSIL, was washed with distillated water and ﬁnally dried at
100 8C. For comparison purposes an amount of sucrose solution
(66 wt% containing 0.1 g H2SO4 g1 of sucrose) was also dried and
carbonized under the same conditions but in the absence of any
silica. The resulting uncast carbon was denominated CUNCAST.
2.3. Preparation of perovskites by nanocasting
LaFe1xCoxO3 (x = 0 or 0.4) perovskites were prepared using a
strategy based on the nanocasting technique. Firstly, an aqueous
solution was prepared containing the perovskite precursors as was
described in Section 2.1. Then, to that solution was added a pre-
established amount of CAEROSIL and the suspension stirred for 1 h.
The excess of water in the suspension was evaporated in an oven at
60 8C for 20 h. In order to convert the inﬁltrated perovskite
precursors into their corresponding oxide phases, the carbon/
inorganic-precursor composite was thermally treated under static
air at 550 8C for 3 h and then at 800 8C for 5 h (heating rate of
4 8C min1). To guarantee the complete elimination of the carbon
mould, the obtained nanocast perovskite was thermally treated
under air ﬂow at 550 8C for 6 h (heating rate of 10 8C min1).
2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The powder diffraction patterns of the prepared uncast and
nanocast
perovskites
were
obtained
in
a
Rigaku
Multiﬂex
diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA and using a Ni-
ﬁltered Cu-Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 A
˚
´ ). The X-ray analyses were
performed in the range of 2u angles from 15 to 908 with a
goniometer rate of 0.58(2u) min1. The formation of the perovskite
phase was conﬁrmed according to JCPDS data [49] while the
crystallite sizes were calculated using the Scherrer’s formula [50].
2.5. Rietveld reﬁnement
The Rietveld reﬁnement method [51] was used to accurately
identify and quantify the crystalline phases in the nanocast
LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite. X-ray diffraction was performed using a
Rigaku RotaFlex operating with Cu-Ka radiation, 50 kV, 100 mA
equipped with a graphite monochromator. The data collection was
recorded in the range of 2u = 20–1108 with a step of 0.028 and 3 s/
step. Rietveld reﬁnement was developed using the space group
Pbnm for La((Co0.4Fe0.6)O3), taking the ones obtained by Karpinsky
et al. [52] as initial parameters and the space group P ¯
3m1 for La2O3,
taking the ones obtained by Hirosaki et al. [53] as initial parameters.
The FULLPROF suit program [54] was used for the Rietveld structure
reﬁnement [55], using the least-squares method [56] to achieve the
best agreement between the measured and the calculated proﬁle.
Parameters of the Lanthanum Cobalt Iron Oxide and Lanthanum
Oxide were obtained from the Inorganic Crystallographic Structure
Database [57]. Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt function was
used as the proﬁle function [58]. The parameters constituting the
instrumental resolution function (U,V,W)instr were obtained from a
LaB6 standard (U = 0.007405, V = 0.021296, W = 0.022455).
2.6. N2 sorption measurements
The speciﬁc surface area Sp (m2/g) was calculated by the BET
method [59] from the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms obtained
at 77 K. The measurements were carried out on a Quantachrome
Corporation Nova-1200 instrument. Prior to the analysis, the
samples (150 mg) were treated at 200 8C for 2 h under vacuum.
The pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption branch
of the isotherm using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method [60].
2.7. Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of the dried Aerosil/sucrose mixture and the
porous carbon CAEROSIL were recorded using the KBr pellet

442
technique in a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer from
500 to 4000 cm1 with 32 scans, 4 cm1 resolution and an interval
of 1 cm1.
2.8. Thermal analysis (TGA/DTG)
The porous carbon CAEROSIL and the uncast perovskites were
further studied by thermogravimetry (TGA/DTG) on a Thermal
Analyst 2100 TA Instruments thermobalance from 25 to 1000 8C
(heating rate of 10 8C min1) under air ﬂow using about 10 mg of
the respective solid. In the case of the nanocast perovskites the TGA
was performed under a static air and after the experiment the
analyzed sample was cooled and submitted to a new TGA under air
ﬂow.
2.9. SEM and TEM images
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded
using a Philips XL 30 FEG instrument. Previous to the analysis, a
thin coating of gold sputter was deposited onto the samples.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a
Philips CM-120 microscope.
2.10. Catalytic tests
The studied perovskites were evaluated in the reduction of NO
with CO that was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a
laboratory scale unit using a ﬁxed bed quartz tubular reactor
containing 100 mg of the catalyst and 100 mg of ground quartz (80
mesh). A mixture of commercial gases of 5000 ppm of NO and
5000 ppm of CO diluted in He (V/V), was fed continuously at a total
rate of 50 mL min1, corresponding to a GHSV of 15,000 h1. The
reactor was installed in a tubular furnace, with the temperature
regulated by an electronic controller through a thermocouple
maintained in contact with the catalyst bed. The feed stream and
the reactor efﬂuents were analyzed by online gas chromatography
using a Shimadzu (GC-17A) instrument equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector (TCD) and a two packed columns, one being a
Porapack N and the other a Molecular Sieve 13X. Each perovskite
was submitted at least to a two catalytic test in all range of the used
temperatures (150–700 8C). In order to obtain additional informa-
tion about the catalytic stability of the nanocast perovskites, they
were submitted to a long term evaluation at conversion level of NO
lower than 100%. Thus, after the second test, the reactor was cooled
to 380 8C and the reaction maintained at this temperature during
1400 min on stream.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the nanocast carbon
Fig. 1 shows the SEM micrograph of the pyrogenic Silica Aerosil
200 used as cast to prepare the porous carbon. The image reveals
the presence of spherical agglomerates with mean diameters in the
range of 10 mm. It is reported that the total speciﬁc surface area
(SBET) for this pyrogenic silica is 200  25 m2/g and that the silica
agglomerates are build-up from smaller primary particles with
diameters of around 12 nm [48].
The nitrogen isotherms of the nanocast carbon (CAEROSIL)
obtained using the Silica Aerosil 200 as mould and the carbon
obtained by sucrose carbonization in the absence of any silica
mould (CUNCAST) are shown in Fig. 2. The speciﬁc surface area (SBET),
the external speciﬁc surface area (Sext), the micropore surface area
(Smicro), the total speciﬁc pore volume (Vtotal), the speciﬁc
mesopore volume (Vmeso) and the speciﬁc micropore volume
(Vmicro) observed for these carbons are summarized in Table 1
together with the mean pore radius taken from the maximum of
their BJH pore size distributions shown as an inset in Fig. 2.
As can be seen from the values given in Table 1, the nitrogen
isotherms and the BJH pore size distribution of the CUNCAST shown in
Fig. 2, demonstrate that a low surface area carbon without any
porosityisformed when the sucrosesolution isdriedand carbonized
in the absence of a silica mould. On the other hand, when Silica
Aerosil 200 was used as cast, the resulting N2 isotherms of the
nanocast carbon were a mixture of types I and IV. This indicates that
a mesoporous carbon (CAEROSIL) with a pore size distribution
between 2 and 8 nm in diameters was obtained (inset in Fig. 2),
which has a relatively large amount of micropores as it is revealed by
its speciﬁc micropore volume (Vmicro), reported in Table 1.
Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrograph of the CAEROSIL that indicates
the presence of agglomerates of carbon particles without a well-
deﬁned morphology, which should represent an inverse replica of
the Silica Aerosil 200 agglomerates. The FTIR spectrum of the
CAEROSIL (not shown) conﬁrmed the sucrose decomposition and did
not show bands at around 1384 and 1596 cm1 that would indicate
the formation of graphite like structures [61–63].
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the differential
thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) of the resulting porous carbon
(CAEROSIL) are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the TG curve indicates
two steps of weight loss at temperatures of around 68 and 638 8C.
These two steps are attributed, respectively, to desorption of water

physically adsorbed and the carbon oxidation, which occurs
without the formation of intermediates. From Fig. 4 it can further
be observed that a mass loss of 100% occurred up to 690 8C. The fact
that the carbon CAEROSIL was completely burned off shows that the
Silica Aerosil 200 used as mould was totally removed after the
treatment with hydroﬂuoric acid.
3.2. Perovskites characterization
Fig. 5 shows the TG curves of the precursors of LaFeO3 and
LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskites conventionally prepared via the citrate
method. It can be observed that the precursors transformation
proceed through the typical mass loss steps [64] related with the
elimination of adsorbed or hydrated water (up to ca. 150 8C);
evaporation and/or decomposition of some remaining citric acid
(at ca. 200 8C); decomposition of ethylene glycol, nitrates and
citrates into carbonates (225–400 8C); decomposition of carbo-
nates species (400–600 8C) and formation of the ﬁnal perovskite
phase (above 600 8C).

As reported [64–66], the transformation of perovskite pre-
cursors prepared by the citrate method occurs only in the presence
of air. For that reason and to avoid the occurrence of a high rate of
carbon oxidation, the calcination of the perovskite inorganic
precursors/carbon CAEROSIL composite was carried out under static
air. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the TGA performed in such condition
show the same principal mass loss steps corresponding to
perovskite formation (Fig. 5), nevertheless, with a higher mass
loss between 300 and 650 8C when compared with the TGA/DTG
curves of the uncast perovskite precursors (Fig. 5). Taking into
account the TGA/DTG results of the carbon CAEROSIL (Fig. 4), the
pointed mass loss increase must be attributed to the carbon
oxidation. To know the extension of this carbon oxidation process,
after the TGA of the inorganic precursors, the formed nanocast
perovskite was cooled to room temperature and resubmitted to a
new TGA under air ﬂow. The TGA results (not shown) did not show
any mass loss, then evidencing that the carbon mould was
simultaneously removed with the citrates and nitrates during the
thermal treatment of the perovskite precursors.
The X-ray diffractograms of LaFeO3 and LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 per-
ovskites, conventionally prepared by the citrate method or by
nanocasting, are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the diffractograms
reveal that the crystalline perovskite structure is the main phase in
all of the synthesized solids. In the diffractogram of the ternary
nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite, low intensity diffraction peaks
corresponding to La2O3 and Fe2O3 are also observed. As shown in
the detail of Fig. 7, the most intense diffraction peak (2u  32.58) is
a single peak for all of the studied perovskites, which conﬁrms the
presence of an orthorhombic structure [67]. The conventional
synthesis method originates very crystalline samples showing
well-resolved and high intensity XRD peaks. On the other hand, the
perovskites prepared by nanocasting, in despite of their well

resolved XRD patterns, showed broader diffraction peaks and
lower in intensity indicating that these solids are constituted by
very small particles. Application of the Scherrer’s formula [50] to
the XRD indicates that nanocast perovskites are constituted by
crystallites of about 6 nm in size.
The results of the X-ray diffraction and the Rietveld reﬁnement
performed on the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite are shown in
Fig. 8 and Table 2. The Rietveld method [55], also known as total
pattern ﬁtting, was used here for an accurate quantitative phase
analysis of the powder patterns of the mentioned nanocast
perovskite, whose conventional XRD pattern above discussed
showed other than the perovskite phase. Quantitative phase
analysis is used to determine the concentration of various phases
that are present in a mixture after the identity of every phase has
been established. Scale factors for every phase present in the
mixture, which are determined quite accurately during Rietveld
reﬁnement, are proportional to the fraction of the unit cells present
in the irradiated volume of the sample. Thus, the scale factors can
be easily converted into weight, molar or volume fractions of the
respective phase, giving the percentage of the phase in the sample
[68].
The reﬁnement was performed in the whole range of collected
data. Only the scale factor, background, cell parameters and the
peak proﬁle parameters were varied; the fractional atomic
coordinates and occupation factors were kept ﬁxed. The observed
and calculated diffractograms and the differences among them
concerning the beginning (Fig. 8a) and the end of the reﬁnement
(Fig. 1b). The end of the reﬁnement led to the disagreement factors
(RP, RWP and REXP) shown in Table 2, which also list the reﬁned
parameters (a, b, c, U, V, W). Based on the Rietveld analysis it was
determined that the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite phase
represents 97.30 wt% of the sample, while 2.70 wt% represents the
presence of impurity, identiﬁed as La2O3. Although were included
in the Rietveld reﬁnement phases containing the metals Co and Fe,
it indicated a negligible concentration for them.
Disagreement factors (Table 2) show that the calculated and
observed diffractograms are in good agreement (Fig. 8), as well as
that the structure was well reﬁned. The obtained Proﬁle Residual

, the
good agreement between calculated and experimental diffracto-
grams is due to the fact that no major discrepancies were observed
between the observed and calculated intensities values y at each
point i (Fig. 8). In the deﬁnition of RWP, weights wi are taking from
the experimental error margins [69].
Table 3 provides the textural properties of the synthesized
materials. It is observed that the nanocasting route resulted in the
formation of perovskites with speciﬁc surface areas substantially
higher than those samples conventionally prepared by the citrate
method. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the isotherms were of type II or III
(predominantly) that are typical for non-porous or macroporous
solids. According to the literature [14,70], the speciﬁc surface area
of perovskites correspond mainly to the external surface of the
particles,
which is
characteristic for
non-porous
grains.
As
expected, the samples conventionally prepared by the citrate
method have no internal porosity as conﬁrmed by the lack of any
isotherm hysteresis loop (Fig. 9a and c) and by the very low values
of pore volume given in Table 3. Thus, for the uncast perovskites
the calculated speciﬁc surface area is due to the external porosity
generated by the agglomeration of the small particles. The
perovskites prepared by nanocasting show similar sorption
isotherms although they have some hysteresis degree (Fig. 9b
and d) and higher speciﬁc surface area and pore volume (Table 3).
These improved textural properties are attributed to the templat-
ing effect of the nanocast carbon during the perovskite synthesis.
In this way, the porosity measurements reveal that the use of
CAEROSIL as hard template produces mainly solids with no
signiﬁcantly intraparticle pores but made up of very small
particles. Therefore, the nanocast perovskites cannot be seen as
an inverse replica of the porous carbon used as template, which
contains framework-conﬁned pores (Fig. 2 and Table 1), but as an
agglomerated material formed majority by non-porous nanopar-
ticles.
Fig. 9 also shows the pore size distribution (PSD) of the studied
perovskites (as insets). As can be seen the uncast and nanocast
perovskites show a broad and irregular PSD. In our experiments,
the production of perovskites following the nanocasting pathway
did not achieve speciﬁc surface areas higher than 50 m2/g. We
attribute this result to the calcination conditions to generate the
perovskite phase, which required the use of high temperatures (up

to 800 8C) and air atmosphere. As veriﬁed, in such conditions the
transformation of the inorganic precursors to oxides occurred
simultaneously with the removal of the carbon by oxidation (Fig. 6)
that could facilitate subsequently the sintering of the formed
perovskite nanoparticles. Thus, the conﬁnement effect during the
perovskite
synthesis
by
nanocasting
cannot
be
completely
preserved, limiting their effect in the increase of the speciﬁc
surface
area.
Therefore,
the
resulting
nanocast
perovskites
synthesized from the procedure applied here still have relatively
low surface area when compared to other nanocast oxides
obtained at lower temperatures.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) conﬁrms the nano-
sized characteristics of the nanocast perovskites. Fig. 10 shows

images
taken
from
LaFeO3
and
LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 prepared using CAEROSIL as mould. It is clear that
the nanocast perovskites consist of agglomerates smaller than
100 nm, which is coherent with the results of N2 sorption
measurements. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns consist of single spots superimposed on diffuse rings
(insets in Fig. 10), indicating that the crystalline domains making
part of the agglomerates are quite small, which is in agreement
with the XRD data.
3.3. Perovskites activity
The catalytic behavior in the reduction of NO with CO of LaFeO3
and LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskites conventionally or nanocasting
prepared is shown in Fig. 11. As expected [22], the conversion
of NO and CO on all the studied perovskites increases with the
increase of the temperature. This activity increase must be
attributed only to the catalytic effect due to the fact that practically
no activity is observed when the NO reduction is carried out
between 200 and 700 8C without any catalyst (see inset in Fig. 11a).
From Fig. 11a it can clearly be seen that the nanocast LaFeO3
perovskite is much more active for the reduction of NO to N2 and
for the oxidation of CO to CO2 than the uncast LaFeO3 one. The
more remarkable is that the nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite reaches
conversions of NO or CO of about 80% at 350 8C and 100% at 400 8C.
The uncast LaFeO3 perovskite reaches 100% of conversion of NO or
CO at temperatures higher than 580 8C. Considering that the
catalyst tests were carried out using the same contact time and
that nanocast and uncast LaFeO3 perovskites have the same
composition, the observed higher activity of the former must be
related with a higher number of accessible active sites and
therefore with its higher speciﬁc surface area.
Nevertheless, a strong effect of the increase of the speciﬁc
surface area in the activity could not always be clearly evidenced.
As can be seen from Fig. 11b, the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3
perovskite shows only a slightly higher activity for NO and CO
conversion than the uncast one. Such little increase in the activity
can be attributed to the enhanced speciﬁc surface area of the
nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, which was lower 40% than that of the
nanocast LaFeO3. On the other hand, it must be taken into
consideration the presence of Co in the ternary discussed
perovskites. As described by Lima [71] substitution of Fe atoms
over 30% by Co atoms in the structure of La–Fe perovskites led to a

lower activities in the studied reactions when compared with the
binary La–Fe or La–Co perovskites.
Nevertheless, as veriﬁed by the XRD data (Fig. 7) and the results
of the Rietveld reﬁnement (Fig. 8 and Table 2), the nanocast
LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskite presented as contaminant the non-active
La2O3 outside of their structure, which in despite of their low
content (2.7 wt%) could partially be blocking the perovskite active
sites, then diminishing their catalytic activity.
Fig. 12 shows the results of two consecutive catalytic test done
with the nanocast LaFeO3 and LaFe0.6Co0.4O3 perovskites. The
reproducibility of the conversion data in the whole 150–700 8C
temperature range evidences that there was no perovskite
deactivation. This catalytic stability indicates that no sintering
or other physical or chemical changes occur during the NO
reduction process. This behavior can be understood taking into
consideration
the
TGA
results
of
the
inorganic
perovskite
precursor/carbon CAEROSIL, which showed that up to 650 8C the
inorganic precursor transformation simultaneously occur with the
carbon oxidation (Fig. 6). Thus, as already commented, the
perovskite sintering must also be taking place during the thermal
treatment under static air involving heating up to 800 8C with a
stay of 5 h at this temperature.
To corroborate the catalytic stability of the studied nanocast
perovskites, experiments were performed during 1400 min on
stream at 380 8C. At that temperature the conversion levels were
lower than 100%, allowing to observe if real differences occur in the
performance of the considered perovskites. As can be clearly seen
in Fig. 13, the nanocast perovskites maintained unchangeable their
catalytic activity in the reactions involved in the reduction of NO
with CO.
4. Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that the speciﬁc surface area of
perovskites can be substantially improved using in their synthesis
a carbon cast in Silica Aerosil 200 as hard template. After the silica
removal from the prepared silica/carbon composite, N2 sorption
measurements evidenced that the nanocast carbon is formed by
mesopores with diameter in the range of 2–8 nm. A signiﬁcant
amount of micropores was also veriﬁed. Other hand, the nanocast
perovskites did not show signiﬁcantly intraparticle porosity in
despite of their enhanced speciﬁc surface area with values
between 30 and 50 m2/g. Nevertheless, TEM images, XRD and
Rietveld reﬁnement data showed that those solids are constituted
at least by 97 wt% of perovskite phase and by agglomerates smaller
than 100 nm, which are composed by nanocrystallites with
diameters of about 6 nm. The synthesis of perovskites following

the nanocasting pathway did not allow the preparation of solids
with speciﬁc surface areas higher than 50 m2/g that was attributed
to the calcination conditions to generate the perovskite phase,
which required the use of high temperatures (up to 800 8C) and air
atmosphere. In such conditions the transformation of the inorganic
precursors to oxides simultaneously occurred with the removal of
the carbon by oxidation that facilitates the subsequently sintering
of the formed perovskite nanoparticles, thus, diminishing the
template effect and limiting the increase of the speciﬁc surface
area. The nanocast LaFeO3 perovskite prepared by nanocasting was
substantially more active in the reduction of NO to N2 with CO and
in the oxidation of the last compound to CO2 than that with the
same composition conventionally prepared by the citrate method.
The improvement in the catalytic behavior of the nanocast LaFeO3
was attributed to the increase in their speciﬁc surface area, which
allows the exposure of a higher number of accessible active sites.
However, the effect of the increase of the perovskite speciﬁc
surface area in the catalytic activity must also be related with the
perovskite composition and the presence of impurities, which
were pointed as the responsible that impeded a more signiﬁcantly
increase in the activity of the nanocast LaFe0.6Co0.4O3, in despite of
its improved textural properties. The nanocast perovskites also
showed high thermal and catalytic stability during long time on
stream, corroborating their high potential as catalysts for the
studied reaction.
