The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on carbon supported MoS2
nanoparticles is investigated and compared to ﬁndings with previously published
work on Au(111) supported MoS2. An investigation into MoS2 oxidation is
presented and used to quantify the surface concentration of MoS2. Other metal
sulﬁdes with morphologies similar to MoS2 such as WS2, cobalt-promoted WS2,
and cobalt-promoted MoS2 were also investigated in the search for improved
HER activity. Experimental ﬁndings are compared to density functional theory
(DFT) calculated values for the hydrogen binding energies (DGH) on each system.
Introduction
Research efforts to develop electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions have
increased substantially in recent years. Platinum, the ubiquitous electrocatalyst
used in PEM fuel cells, is both expensive and scarce, prompting widespread efforts
to discover cost-effective materials to replace Pt. In this work we focus on non-noble
metal sulﬁde catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic
conditions, a reaction catalyzed most effectively by Pt-based materials.1
Previously, MoS2 has been studied as a catalyst in hydrodesulfurisation2 and in
the photo-oxidation of organics.3,4 In electrocatalysis, it has recently been shown
that the edge structure of nanoparticulate MoS2 is active for the HER, mimicking
the active sites/co-factor of the hydrogen evolving enzymes nitrogenase and hydrog-
enase.5,6 This work aims to extend the investigation on carbon-supported nanopar-
ticulate MoS2 for the HER. Unlike the case of Au(111) supported MoS2 studied by
STM in previous work,6 the catalysts probed herein are more commercially relevant,
which also implies that they are less homogeneous and more difﬁcult to image on the
atomic scale. As knowledge of the concentration of active sites on a catalyst surface
is paramount to elucidating structure–composition–activity relationships, the ﬁrst
aim of this work is to utilize electrochemical oxidation to probe MoS2 surface
area, distinguishing between basal plane and edge sites. In developing this method-
ology to quantify active sites on a macroscopic scale, we then direct our attention to
related catalyst systems, namely WS2, cobalt-promoted WS2, and cobalt-promoted
MoS2. We end by comparing experimentally determined activity data to predictions

made by density functional theory (DFT) models of these systems in order to gain
insight into trends in catalyst activity.
It has been found that DGH, the hydrogen binding energy to a given surface, is
a good descriptor for identifying electrocatalyst materials with high exchange current
densities.1,7,8 A recent study5 using DFT showed that the active sites on nitrogenase
and hydrogenase bind hydrogen weakly, similar to Pt. It was also found that the over-
potential of carbon supported MoS2 is comparable to the DFT calculated hydrogen
binding energy on the edge of the nanoparticles. In another study, MoS2 nanopar-
ticles on Au(111) were synthesized under UHV conditions, characterized by STM
and examined for HER activity.6 This study showed direct evidence that the active
site of the MoS2 nanoparticles is indeed the edge. The exchange current density was
also found to be in agreement with the volcano relation between the HER exchange
current density and the DFT calculated values for DGH proposed by Nørskov et al.7
By having identiﬁed the active site of MoS2 particles, the next step is to modify that
edge such that its DGH approaches even closer to zero where the HER volcano curve
has its maximum, and this is a major aim of the work presented herein.
Bulk MoS2 consists of stacked S–Mo–S layers, and MoS2 nanoparticles can be
synthesized as single layer hexagonal structures exposing two different kinds of
edges, the so-called Mo-edge and the S-edge.9 It has been shown that the structure
of nanoparticulate MoS2 is a single layered truncated triangle primarily exposing
the Mo-edge when supported on Au(111),6,9 highly ordered pyrolytic graphite
(HOPG)10 or graphitic carbon.11 Brorson et al.11,12 also found truncated triangles
by means of HAADF-STEM (high-angle annular dark-ﬁeld-scanning transmission
electron microscopy) in their investigation of MoS2, WS2 and cobalt-promoted
MoS2.
Estimating the number of active sites on a nanoparticulate catalyst is not trivial.
One approach is to measure activity on well deﬁned model systems characterized by
STM, for example UHV-deposited nanoparticles6,13 or physi- or chemisorbed molec-
ular clusters.14 Another option is to use a well established method to measure
electrochemically active surface area such as that used with Pt based on the adsorp-
tion–desorption behavior of underpotentially deposited hydrogen, Hupd.15 We note,
however, that this method still relies upon the assumption that the sites active for
Hupd are the same as those active for the HER. As we are studying metal sulﬁdes
where no such method exists, the irreversible oxidation of metal sulﬁdes will be
investigated as a measure of their surface area and edge sites.
In the following, we will show our investigation of MoS2, WS2 and cobalt
promoted WS2 (Co–W–S) and MoS2 (Co–Mo–S), prepared similarly to the ones
imaged by Brorson et al.11 and supported on Toray carbon paper. The electrochem-
ical measurements will be discussed in relation to DFT calculations of DGH for each
of the metal sulfates investigated in order to identify structure–composition–activity
relationships for these systems.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and electrochemical characterization of MoS2
MoS2 particles on Toray carbon paper were prepared by dropping 25 mL of an
aqueous ammonia heptamolybdate (1mM Mo) solution onto 1 cm2 of Toray paper.
The sample was dried in air at 140 C followed by sulﬁdation in 10% H2S in H2 at
450 C for 4 hours, and subsequently cooled in that same gas stream. This prepara-
tion method would typically give the highest HER current on a per gram basis;
higher loadings usually led to lower HER currents.
HER activity was measured (see experimental details) and the results are plotted as
Tafel (log i–E) and polarization curves (i–E) in Fig. 1. The Tafel plot exhibits a slope
of 120 mV dec1 and an exchange current density of 4.6  106 A cm2geometric.
Samples prepared by different methods have often yielded different Tafel slopes,

ranging between 110 mV dec1 and several hundred mV dec1. We attribute this to
transport limitations through the ﬁbrous, porous network characteristic of Toray
carbon paper. Although sample/substrate preparation could potentially be optimized
further, the consistent results achieved using the preparation method described above
allows for accurate cross-comparisons among different catalyst materials. It should
be noted that hydrogen evolution is taking off at around 0.2 V vs. NHE just as
we have previously seen on MoS2.5,6
The current measured from approx. +0.1 V vs. NHE to 0.15 V is most likely not
due to the HER but rather oxygen reduction at the interface between the electrolyte
and the electrode. Finally, it should be noted that sweeps between 0.35 and +0.1 V
vs. NHE showed negligible change over time, apart from the effects of bubble forma-
tion on the electrode.
Fig. 2 shows a cyclic voltammogram of MoS2/C where the potential is cycled
between 0.3 and +1.05 V vs. NHE. At approx. +0.6 V vs. NHE an irreversible

an irreversible oxidation peak occurs at 0.6 V vs. NHE and is followed by a subsequent decrease
in current at cathodic potentials (0.35 V vs. NHE), indicating a deactivation of the active sites.

oxidation begins to occur with a maximum at +0.98 V vs. NHE. On the subsequent
cathodic sweep a signiﬁcant drop in HER activity is noticed. On the ensuing anodic
sweep seen in the inset of Fig. 2, the oxidation peak is no longer present. Thus, the
loss of HER activity is attributed to irreversible MoS2 oxidization. In subsequent
studies, fresh samples were subjected to CVs in which an initially narrow potential
window was widened gradually to more positive (anodic) potentials. It was found
that the HER activity of MoS2/C remained stable with every sweep as long as the
anodic potential was limited to #+0.6 V vs. NHE.
MoS2 electro-oxidation
To our knowledge, the electrochemical oxidation of nanoparticulate MoS2 is not
covered in the literature, which instead focuses on the corrosion of bulk MoS2. Kau-
tek and Gerischer16 found that the bulk system preferentially oxidized at the (10
11)
face and that it did not corrode at the (0001) basal plane. On the nanoparticles this
would correspond to corrosion of the particle edges. Closer examination of the insert
of Fig. 2 reveals two distinct oxidation peaks. The major peak has its maximum
at approx. +0.98 V vs. NHE whereas the minor peak has its maximum at approx.
+0.7 V vs. NHE. As the edges of MoS2 nanoparticles are expected to be more readily
oxidized than the basal plane,16 we interpret the two distinct oxidation peaks to
correspond to the edges (minor peak, +0.7 V vs. NHE) and the basal planes (major
peak, +0.98 V vs. NHE) of the particles. While only one cycle to +1.05 V vs. NHE
will completely deactivate the sample for the HER, it takes several cycles to +0.7 V
vs. NHE to achieve the same effect. This implies that not all edge sites are oxidized
with a single sweep to +0.7 V vs. NHE. Had the sample been deactivated for the
HER after a single sweep to +0.7 V vs. NHE, we could deﬁnitely have used this
peak as a measure of the concentration of edge sites. But as this is not the case,
we will use the major peak at +0.98 V vs. NHE to determine the total surface
area of MoS2/C. We have however attempted to use the weak feature at +0.7 V
vs. NHE to get an estimate of our particle size. At low sweep rates (2 mV s1), the
feature is typically not dominated by the major feature at +0.98 V vs. NHE. The
area of the edge feature is approx. 8% of the major peak. If the particles are trian-
gular, this corresponds to an edge length of around 25 nm, consistent with the
particle sizes observed by Brorson et al.11
XPS was also employed in this investigation to study the MoS2/C at three stages of
its life: freshly prepared, after HER in H2SO4 and after oxidation in H2SO4 at high
anodic potentials (see experimental details). To obtain a reasonable signal to noise
ratio for the XPS studies the Toray paper was dip coated in a 0.14 M Mo solution
instead of dropping a known amount of solution on the surface, resulting in a higher
loading of Mo than previously described (a factor of 5–10 according to the charge of
the oxidation peak). The survey spectra of the different samples showed no contam-
inants on the freshly prepared samples. On the samples that had been submerged in
H2SO4, peaks corresponding to sulfate were seen and a peak corresponding to N 1s
was also seen. The N 1s peak is most likely caused by trace amounts of NH3 present
in air absorbed by H2SO4 as (NH4)2SO4 with a N 1s binding energy of 401.3 eV.17
The XPS data, see Fig. 3. reveals that the freshly prepared sample (no. 1) of MoS2
is similar to previously reported MoS2 spectra.18–20 The XPS data from a similarly
prepared sample that was tested for the HER (sample no. 2a) by sweeping the poten-
tial between +0.1 V and 0.45 V vs. NHE, showed an increase in the SO4
2 peak
which is to be expected as the sample had been submerged in H2SO4. Apart from
the increase in the SO4
2 peak, no signiﬁcant changes were found compared to the
freshly prepared sample, indicating that MoS2/C does not change signiﬁcantly
during the HER. After XPS analysis of sample no. 2a, it was examined for the
HER again, then cycled between 0.4 V vs. NHE and +1.4. V vs. NHE and removed
from the solution at 0.32 V vs. NHE (sample no. 2b in the XPS spectra). A signif-
icant decrease of the Mo 3d, Mo 3p, S 2s and S 2p peaks was observed and there was

no XPS signal corresponding to MoO3. Thus, although the amount of surface Mo
decreased signiﬁcantly it still maintained its Mo4+ character (as in MoS2). There
are several possible explanations for the lack of Mo on the surface: (1) the MoS2
desorbs from the surface at high anodic potentials, (2) the oxidation product of
MoS2, MoO3, dissolves,21 (3) that MoO3 is reduced to Mo3+ at 0.32 V vs. NHE
and subsequently dissolves.21 To answer this question, sample no. 3 was subjected
to the same oxidation treatment as sample no. 2b but in this case the sample was
pulled out of solution at a higher potential (+0.4 V vs. NHE), where MoO3 is ther-
modynamically stable according to the Pourbaix diagrams.21 XPS reveals a shift of
the Mo 3d and Mo 3p towards higher binding energies just as expected for MoO3.
Thus, it is unlikely that MoS2 dissolves at anodic potentials.
We note that the Mo peaks of the MoO3 were signiﬁcantly greater than the Mo
peaks observed on the other samples and at the same time the C 1s peak was signif-
icantly smaller. The increase in intensity could be due to a higher loading on this
speciﬁc sample but we only found a factor of 2 larger oxidation peak on sample
3 than on sample 2a/b. This leads us to believe that there could be surface enrichment
of Mo species on the outermost exposed surface of the Toray paper after repeated
dissolution–redeposition cycles during each potential sweep.
Having established that the MoS2 is in fact being oxidized at high anodic poten-
tials we will now elaborate on possible reaction mechanisms. The reaction mecha-
nism will enable us to use the irreversible oxidation peaks to determine the
amount of MoS2 present on the surface. A plot of the correlation between the
amount of Mo used during synthesis and the charge of the irreversible oxidation

peak is shown on Fig. 4. In a corrosion study by Jaegermann and Schmeisser,18 bulk
MoS2 was electrochemically oxidized in KNO3 and examined by XPS. A shift
toward higher binding energies was observed for the S 2p and Mo 3d peaks and
a broadening was observed in the S 2p line. This was interpreted as MoS2 degrada-
tion to SO4
2, S2
2 and MoO3. We can, with this knowledge, consider how many
electrons we expect to use to oxidize one Mo atom. If we consider one extreme where
the carbon supported MoS2 is decomposed into MoO3 and SO4
2 the following
reaction would take place, where 18 electrons are transferred per Mo atom:
MoS2 + 11H2O / MoO3 + 2SO4
2 + 22H+ + 18e
(1)
The other extreme would be that MoS2 is decomposed into MoO3 and S2
2 where
4 electrons are needed:
MoS2 + 3H2O / MoO3 + S2
2 + 6H+ + 4e
(2)
According to Fig. 4, the correlation between the oxidation peak and the deposited
amount of Mo yields 8.9 (r2 ¼0.55) electrons per Mo atom used in the deposition.
This number is in between the two extremes mentioned above. Revisiting the XPS
data we can not see whether we have produced excess SO4
2 due to the background
of H2SO4. We are, however, also not seeing any signiﬁcant amounts S2
2 after cyclic
voltammetry. While the samples have been subject to a high anodic (1.4 vs. NHE)
potential where S2
2 can be oxidized to SO4
2, the subsequent high cathodic (0.4
vs. NHE) potential can reduce the S2
2 to H2S.21 We can not conclusively determine
the exact nature of the oxidation reaction. But our measurements indicate that the
sulfur in the MoS2 is only partially oxidized during anodic sweeps, resulting in the
following proposed reaction mechanism:
MoS2 + 7H2O / MoO3 + SO4
2 + 1⁄2 S2
2 + 14 H+ + 11e

HER activity of MoS2/C
In order to determine the activity of the MoS2/C system per active site, we start with
the irreversible oxidation to estimate the total surface area of MoS2 on the Toray
paper. The irreversible oxidation peak of the sample, shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,
has a charge of 0.014 C. If we assume that 11 electrons are involved in the oxidation

of MoS2, as presented in the previous section, the surface area will be 3.8 cm2 of
single layered MoS2 giving an exchange current density (i0) of 1.2  106 A cm2
(and a Tafel slope of 120mV dec1). We have previously shown that the active
sites of Au(111) supported MoS2 nanoparticles are situated on the edge (i0 ¼7.9 
106 A cm2).6
The exchange current density on a per active site basis will clearly be higher than
the exchange current densities reported above, since few of the MoS2 sites are on the
edge. Thus, the values above constitute a lower bound for activity. If we incorporate
the fact that the MoS2 nanoparticles are triangular with an edge length of 25 nm,
approx. 8% of the atoms will be situated at the edge of the particle. This would
lead to a 12-fold increase in exchange current density per active site.
Electrochemical characterization of WS2
WS2 exhibits a layered structure similar to MoS2,11,12 forming the same triangular
shape as MoS2 when prepared under similar conditions. WS2 supported on SiO2
has previously been proposed as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.22
The WS2 was studied on Toray paper and the preparation method was similar to
that of the MoS2 samples (see experimental details). In Fig. 5, the results of the elec-
trochemical measurements are shown. Fig. 5A shows a Tafel plot (log i–E) and
a polarization curve (i–E) in the region where we have previously observed hydrogen
evolution on MoS2 samples. On the polarization curve (inset of Fig. 5A) the cathodic
current increases at potentials more negative than 0.2 V vs. NHE ascribed to HER
activity. The Tafel slope on this sample is found to be 135 mV dec1, indicating that
the current could be transport limited. Fig. 5b shows the deactivation of the sample
at positive potentials. As with the MoS2/C sample, an oxidation feature is observed
with a peak at approx. 1 V vs. NHE, and on consecutive sweeps the peak disappears
concurrent with a drop in the HER current. This is the same behavior as we have
seen on the MoS2/C sample except that the WS2 sample required two sweeps towards
highly anodic potentials before the HER current was affected. This behavior was
also observed with high loadings of MoS2/C samples that surely had formed multi-
layers. In this case, the outer layer could be passivated by a sulfur/oxide layer, thus
requiring several oxidation/reduction steps to completely dissolve the metal sulﬁde.
Apart from the potential formation of multilayers the oxidation of the WS2 is similar
to that of MoS2/C, and it is assumed that the oxidation process is similar to that of
MoS2/C.
Cobalt promoted MoS2 and WS2
Cobalt is often used to promote WS2 and MoS2 in catalyzing the hydrodesulfuriza-
tion reaction. Both the structural and the catalytic effect of adding cobalt has been
extensively studied.2 It is widely accepted that the cobalt is located at the edge of
MoS2, more speciﬁcally the so called S-edge (
1110). Cobalt promotion of MoS2
has also been shown to change the morphology signiﬁcantly.11 Cobalt promoted

MoS2 is usually found as truncated triangles exposing the S-edge (
1110) predomi-
nantly, unlike the unpromoted MoS2, in which the triangles are less truncated
and primarily expose their Mo-edge (
1010).23 In the following we will show data
for sulﬁded Co and Co promoted WS2 and MoS2.
Electrochemical characterization of cobalt sulﬁde (CoSx)
The ﬁrst step in testing the promotion by cobalt is the test of sulﬁded cobalt itself.
We have used Co(acetate) as the Co precursor as described in ref. 11. The precursor
was sulﬁded under the same conditions as the MoS2 and the WS2 samples (see exper-
imental details). The Co is expected to be in the form of Co8S9 immediately after
sulﬁdation, but as this form is not stable in air,24 our Co sulﬁde is most likely
partially sulﬁded (CoSx).
Fig. 6A shows the initial and the stable Tafel (log i–E) and polarization curves
(i–E) within a narrow potential window (maximum +0.1 V vs. NHE). Initially the
activity is high, but unlike MoS2 and WS2, subsequent sweeps within this potential
window show a signiﬁcant decrease in activity. The decrease is most likely due to the
CoSx instability in sulfuric acid, introducing ambiguity into the interpretation of the
current at cathodic potentials as the HER competes with cathodic desorption or
dissolution of CoSx. In Fig. 6B a wide sweep is exhibited. The CoSx exhibits similar
oxidation features as we have seen on the MoS2 and WS2, but in this case the oxida-
tion peak is shifted towards a higher potential (1.14 V vs. NHE). After, oxidation
the HER activity drops just as with MoS2 and WS2, again indicating oxidation of
the material.
Cobalt promoted MoS2(Co–Mo–S) and WS2(Co–W–S)
The Co promoted WS2 and MoS2 was prepared by co-impregnation of the Mo/W
and the Co precursor (see experimental details). Fig. 7A and C shows the Tafel
(log i–E) and the polarization (inset) curve (i–E) within a narrow potential window
(maximum +0.1 V vs. NHE). The HER current diminishes just as on the pure CoSx
sample: it is initially high and after subsequent sweeps the current decreases notice-
ably, but unlike the case of pure CoSx, remains stable at a fairly high level. This indi-
cates that some of the Co promoter is in the state of CoSx, but as the current
stabilizes at a higher level than pure CoSx, MoS2 or WS2, the remaining Co must
have a promotion effect. The Tafel slopes are also in the expected region (Co–
W–S 132 mV dec1, Co–Mo–S 101 mV dec1). In Fig. 7B and D, the CVs within
a wide potential window are shown, and just as on the other metal sulﬁdes we
observe an irreversible oxidation peak followed by a signiﬁcant decrease in HER
activity. The peak maximum, however, seems to be shifted to a more anodic
potential (approx. 1.1 V vs. NHE) than those corresponding to the unpromoted
MoS2 and WS2.

DFT calculations on WS2, MoS2, Co–Mo–S and Co–W–S
We have calculated DGH at the S-edge (
1010) and the Mo/W-edge (
1010) of WS2 and
MoS2 and on the Co promoted S-edge (
1010) edge of WS2 and MoS2 over a wide
range of S coverage and H coverage. The choice of the relevant edge conﬁgurations
have been based on the chemical potential of hydrogen and sulfur at the experi-
mental sulﬁding conditions using a thermodynamic model similar to the one
presented in ref. 25. The structure and the differential free energies of H adsorption
for these structures can be seen in Fig. 8. The results indicate that non-promoted
WS2 and MoS2 nanoparticles should be reasonably good hydrogen evolution
catalysts, since both edges on both systems have free energies of adsorption close
to zero. Hydrogen evolution on MoS2 is expected to take place predominantly at
the Mo-edge (DGH ¼ 0.08 eV) rather than the S-edge (DGH ¼ 0.18 eV), while for
WS2 both edges are equally good (DGH ¼ 0.22 eV). Given these values for DGH,
non-promoted MoS2 is predicted to be a better hydrogen evolution catalyst
than WS2.
The incorporation of cobalt into the edge structures of both WS2 and MoS2 is
expected to have a promotion effect. The cobalt only incorporates itself into the
S-edge of both cases, so DGH values at the Mo/W-edge remain unaffected. At the
S-edge, however, DGH is reduced to 0.10 eV and 0.07 eV for MoS2 and WS2, respec-
tively (down from 0.18 eV and 0.22 eV). We note that the free energy of hydrogen
adsorption at the cobalt-promoted S-edge of MoS2 is very similar to the free energy

of hydrogen adsorption on the Mo-edge of MoS2. Therefore, for MoS2 the effect of
promotion is the increase in the number of sites with high activity. On WS2, the
effect of cobalt promotion is the creation of new sites with higher activity than
that prior to promotion.
In comparing all catalyst systems, DFT calculations suggest that cobalt-promoted
MoS2 (Co–Mo–S) should be a better catalyst than Co promoted WS2 (Co–W–S)
because it would have active sites on both edges and therefore a higher total number
of active sites.
Linking catalyst structure and composition to HER activity
Calculated DFT values are best compared to experimental data where the activity
has been normalized with respect to the number of active sites on the catalyst, in
this case the number and type of edge sites on the different metal sulﬁdes. We accom-
plish this normalization by using the irreversible oxidation features of each sulﬁde.
Fig. 9 exhibits normalized polarization curves (E–i) pertaining to each of the
different samples. There is an apparent promotion effect of Co on both the MoS2
and the WS2 samples. The promotion effect on the WS2 sample can be explained
by the DFT calculations predicting that the Co promotion should decrease the
free energy of hydrogen adsorption from 0.22 eV to 0.07 eV on the S-edge, and
thus effectively increasing the activity of the active site. MoS2 is a slightly different
case. It has previously been found that the Mo-edge of MoS2, which has a DGH of
0.08 eV, is the major edge exposed, and that this edge does not adsorb cobalt.23,26,27
However, the inhomogenous nature of these nanoparticulate catalysts suggests that
both the Mo-edge and the S-edge will be present in signiﬁcant fractions. Thus, the
cobalt on the S-edge of MoS2 promotes the HER, as its free energy of hydrogen
adsorption is decreased from 0.18 eV to 0.10 eV. In other words, the number of
active sites is increased since the normally less active S-edges becomes more active
in the presence of cobalt.
Experimental and calculation details
Toray carbon paper was used as support material because it is inert, of high purity,
has high conductivity and because it has adsorption sites/defects that will anchor the
metal sulﬁde particles. The Toray paper was cut into strips that were 1 cm wide and
5 cm long. The Toray paper was loaded with catalyst by wetness impregnation with
an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24$4H2O in the case of MoS2 and an aqueous
solution of H24N6O39W12$xH2O in the case of WS2. In the case of the sulﬁded
Co, C4H4CoO4$4H2O in an aqueous solution was used. The promoted WS2 and
MoS2 were made by co-impregnation of Co and Mo/W. The impregnation of the
pure sulﬁdes was done by dropping a 25 mL aliquot (0.3–1 mM for Mo, 0.8 mM
for W, 4mM for Co). The co-impregnation of the promoted sulﬁdes was done by

adding a 25 mL aliquot of Mo (0.7 mM) or W (0.8 mM) solution followed by a 25 mL
aliquot of Co (4 mM) solution. A different sample preparation was used for the
MoS2 sample for XPS analysis where a the Toray paper was dip coated in the
Mo solution (0.14 M) to obtain a more uniform impregnation.
The samples were dried at 140 C and afterwards sulﬁded in a tube furnace under
10% H2S in H2 at 450 C for 4 hours. The samples were cooled down in the same gas
stream.
The electrochemical measurements where performed in N2 purged 0.5 M H2SO4
(pH 0.4). To avoid contamination from the SCE reference electrode, a salt bridge
was used. A Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode.
The XPS data was recorded using a Perkin-Elmer surface analysis system (Phys-
ical Electronics Industries Inc., USA) with a chamber base pressure of 1010 Torr.
Al-Ka radiation (1486.6 eV) was used for excitation. The XPS scans on Fig. 4
were measured with a pass energy of 100 eV, a step size of 1 eV, and 250 ms step1.
DFT calculations
An inﬁnite stripe model, which has previously been proven successful to investigate
MoS2 based systems,5,28–30 is used to investigate the edges of MoS2. The inﬁnite stripe
exposes both the (
1010) Mo-edge and the (
1110) S-edge. The supercell has 4 Mo
atoms in the x-direction and 4 Mo atoms in the y-direction, in order to allow for
important reconstructions with a period of 2 in the x-direction and to allow decou-
pling of the Mo-edge and the S-edge in the y-direction. The stripes are separated by
14.8 A
˚ in the z-direction and 9 A
˚ in the y-direction.
The plane wave density functional theory code DACAPO31,32 is used to perform
the DFT calculations. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack
k-point set33 containing 4 k-points in the x-direction and 1 k-point in the y- and
z-direction. The calculated equilibrium lattice constant is 3.235 A
˚ and 3.214 A
˚ for
MoS2 and WS2, respectively. A plane-wave cutoff of 30 Rydberg and a density
wave cutoff of 45 Rydberg are employed using the double-grid technique.34 Ultrasoft
pseudopotentials are used except for sulfur, where a soft pseudopotential is
employed.35,36 A Fermi temperature of kBT ¼ 0.1 eV is used for all calculations
and energies are extrapolated to zero electronic temperature. The exchange correla-
tion functional RPBE is used. The convergence criterion for the atomic relaxation is
that the norm of the total force should be smaller than 0.15 eV A
˚ 1, which corre-
sponds approximately to a max. force on one atom below 0.05 eV A
˚ 1. Figures of
atomic structures have been made using VMD.37
The differential free energies are calculated as described in ref. 5, where 0.29 eV is
added to the pure DFT energy of adsorption in order to take zero point energy and
entropy into account.
Conclusions
We have studied the hydrogen evolution on Co promoted and unpromoted nano-
particulate MoS2 and WS2 structures. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that they are
irreversibly oxidized at high anodic potentials. We have used the irreversible
oxidation features to determine the surface area of MoS2 and proposed a possible
oxidation mechanism of MoS2. XPS analysis showed no change in the oxidation
state of MoS2 after HER measurements; but after oxidation at potentials above
0.6 V vs. NHE, MoS2 was oxidized. We found that the activity of the carbon sup-
ported MoS2 is comparable to that of our previously published results on Au(111)
supported MoS2. WS2 has a similar structure and was also investigated in this study.
It was found to irreversibly oxidize at high anodic potentials, just like MoS2, and
was found to be almost as active. Tests of cobalt promoted MoS2 and WS2 samples
were also performed and Co is indeed promoting the HER in both cases. The

ﬁndings are corroborated by DFT calculations showing that the activity of the
different samples should be WS2 < MoS2 ¼ Co–Mo–S < Co–W–S.
