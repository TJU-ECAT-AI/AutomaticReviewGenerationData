Abstract
In the LaFePdO3 perovskite catalyst, redox ﬂuctuations of the exhaust gas suppress the growth of particles of precious metal by caus-
ing Pd to move in and out of the perovskite crystal. To observe the real movements of Pd directly, the time evolution of local structure
around Pd by redox ﬂuctuations was investigated by in situ energy-dispersive X-ray absorption ﬁne-structure (DXAFS) analysis with a
10 ms resolution. We proved that the change in structure of Pd is suﬃciently fast to respond to the control frequency (1–4 Hz) of an
actual gasoline engine and that the Pd particles that segregate out are extremely ﬁne.

1. Introduction
Automotive catalysts deteriorate as a result of a
decrease in the active surface area of the precious metals
caused by grain growth in the high-temperature reduc-
tion–oxidation (redox) ﬂuctuations of the exhaust gas. To
compensate for this deterioration, conventional catalysts
are loaded with excess amounts of precious metals, but this
leads to over-consumption of precious metals and to prob-
lems in their supply. Pd–perovskite catalysts can maintain
a high activity through a self-regeneration function in
which Pd forms a solid–solution with the perovskite crystal
and then becomes segregated from the perovskite crystal.
These movements of Pd would occur in response to the
redox conditions of the environment [1–8].
In previous experiments, samples were pretreated in oxi-
dative, reductive, and re-oxidative atmospheres for 1 h
each and then the local structures and valence states of
Pd were measured by standard X-ray absorption ﬁne-struc-
ture (XAFS) analysis [1,6–8]. These experiments suggested
that Pd moves in and out of perovskite crystal, but did not
show the speed of movement of the Pd.
Energy-dispersive
X-ray
absorption
ﬁne-structure
(DXAFS) is a useful technique for investigating the
dynamical change in local structures and valence states
[9–12]. We have previously reported the preliminary results
of an in situ DXAFS experiment with a temporal resolu-
tion of about 1 s [13]. These results suggested that Pd
changes in its state at a higher speed than this resolution,
so a high-speed analysis was needed to know how the Pd
moves qualitatively. Here, we show by direct observation
using in situ DXAFS analysis with a time resolution of
10 ms that this phenomenon can occur at an extremely

high-speed that is suﬃciently fast to respond to the control
frequency (1–4 Hz).
2. Experimental
A Pd-containing perovskite-type catalyst, LaFe0.90-
Pd0.10O3 (LaFePdO3), was prepared by the alkoxide
method.
A
solution
of
metal
ethoxyethylates
[M3+(OC2H4OC2H5)3] of La, Fe and palladium acetylacet-
onate [Pd2+(CH3COCHCOCH3)2] in toluene was hydro-
lyzed with
deionized water to give a Pd-containing
precipitate. This precursor was dried and then calcined at
800 C for 2 h in air to give a perovskite powder catalyst
containing homogeneously distributed Pd.
To prepare the conventional catalysts, powdered c-
Al2O3 was impregnated with dilute aqueous Pd(NO3)2 then
dried and calcined at 500 C for 1 h in the air.
X-ray absorption spectra were measured at beamline ID
24, ESRF, France [12]. The silicon polychrometer crystal
was set to the Bragg conﬁguration with the (311) reﬂection
plane to obtain a dispersed X-ray beam near the Pd K-edge
(24.347 keV). A pellet of each sample was located at the
focus of the dispersed X-ray beam. The transmitted X-
ray intensity was detected by a charge-coupled device
camera with a ﬂuorescent screen. The XAFS spectra were
consecutively measured for 5 s with a resolution of 10 ms.
A pellet of each sample was placed in a quartz tube
(/ = 5.0 mm). 50% O2 (balanced with He) was used as
the oxidizing gas, and 50% H2 (balanced with He) was used
as the reducing gas. The total gas ﬂow rate was set at
100 cm3 min1. This reducing gas concentration, relative
to the amount of Pd, was considered to be equivalent to
that of an actual engine exhaust gas (Table 1) [14]. A ther-
mal conductivity detector (TCD) was located in front of
the quartz tube. A trigger signal from the TCD, which
detects the diﬀerence in the thermal conductivity of the
gases, was used to start the measurements. The samples
were heated to 400 C by an infrared furnace. Fig. 1 shows
the gas sequence and the temperature conditions. The
insertion of He as a purge gas was programmed to prevent
the production of an explosive gas mixture. Just after
switching the gas ﬂow to reducing or to oxidizing, spectra
were measured for 5 s at 400 C. After measurement under
oxidizing conditions, the temperature was raised to 700 C
in 50% O2 (balanced with He) gas ﬂow for 30 s to com-
pletely restore the Pd to the perovskite crystal lattice. To
improve the counting statistics, measurements were carried
out continually over ten repetitions of the reducing–oxidiz-
ing cycle, and XAFS spectra were accumulated ten times.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the radial distribution
function around Pd, which was obtained by Fourier trans-
form of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, typically in
the range of k values from 3.0 A
˚ 1 to 8.0 A
˚ 1. There are
two peaks in each samples corresponding to the Pd–O
bond and the Pd–Pd bond, respectively. The Pd–O bond
of LaFePdO3 originates from the B-site of the perovskite
structure [1,7], whereas the Pd–O bond of Pd/Al2O3 origi-
nates from PdO [1,7]. The Pd–Pd bond originates from
metallic Pd for both catalysts.
As shown in Fig. 2, the peak intensity for the Pd–O
bond gradually decreases for the reduction process. The
peak corresponding to the Pd–Pd bond then appears and
its intensity increases. The peak for the Pd–Pd bond of
LaFePdO3 indicated by arrow corresponds to metallic
Pd. The segregated Pd from perovskite crystal does not,
therefore, alloy with Fe under these conditions. During
the oxidation process, as shown in Fig. 2, the signal for
the Pd–Pd bond decreases and disappears, whereas that
for the Pd–O bond appears and increases.
Fig. 3 shows the time dependence of the coordination
number (CN) of the Pd–O bonds and Pd–Pd bond. The
theoretical CN of the Pd–O bond for the perovskite crystal
is 6 and that for PdO is 4. In the analysis of the spectra, the
Debye–Waller factors were ﬁxed at those values extracted
from reference materials (Pd and PdO powder) measured
at the same temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a for the reduc-
tion process, the CN of the Pd–O bond decreased from 5.6
to 1.1. The decreasing of the CN of the Pd–O bond meant
that about 20% of the Pd remained dissolved in the perov-
skite crystal and about 80% of the Pd was reduced at
400 C. This reduction ratio of Pd in LaFePdO3 at
400 C was almost equal to the values obtained in other
analyses [8]. The CN of the generated Pd–Pd bond in LaF-
ePdO3 increased instantaneous and kept less than 6.2.

As shown in Fig. 3c, the CN of the Pd–Pd bond in Pd/
Al2O3 was increasing slowly to 8.1 with grain growth of
metal Pd.
The observed CN of the Pd–Pd bond of LaFePdO3 was
about 6.2 in the reduction process. The observed CN was
corrected to allow for the existence ratio of Pd in an oxi-
dized or reduced state (Table 2). As a result, the corrected
CN of the Pd–Pd bond was 7.7 (=6.2/0.804). This cor-
rected CN of the Pd–Pd bond should, theoretically, be 12
for a large particle of metallic Pd with an fcc structure.
The small CN value observed in this case is caused by
the size eﬀect for smaller particles.
The average CN decreases as the surface-to-bulk ratio
increases, because the CN of surface atoms is smaller than
that of atoms in the bulk material. The average coordina-
tion number for a cube consisting of fcc unit cells is derived
by taking into consideration the surface-to-bulk ratio. If
the particle consists of n3 unit cells and the lattice constant
a, the edge length of the cube is L = na. The average coor-
dination number [N(n)] can be calculated according to the
following formula [7]:
NðnÞ ¼
24n2ð2n þ 1Þ
ðn þ 1Þð4n2 þ 2n þ 1Þ
The lattice constant (a) of Pd is 0.389 nm. From
N(n) = 7.7 and n = 2.1, the average particle size L of Pd
particle segregated from LaFePdO3 is therefore roughly
estimated to be about 0.8 nm.
On the other hand, the CN of metallic Pd on Al2O3
increased up to 8.1. The CN of Pd–O was changed to 0.4
from 3.8, showing that about 90% of the PdO was reduced.
The corrected CN of Pd–Pd bond was calculated to be
9.1(=8.1/0.895, n = 3.4). The average Pd particle size on
Al2O3 therefore corresponded to about 1.3 nm.
As shown in Fig. 3b for the oxidation process, the CN
of metallic Pd of LaFePdO3 decreased quickly and the
CN of the Pd–O bond of LaFePdO3 recovered to 5.0
instantly. This CN of the Pd–O of LaFePdO3 meant that
about 50% of the Pd was dissolved in the perovskite
crystal and about 50% of the Pd was oxidized to PdO
at 400 C. As the temperature was raised to 700 C
after measurement under oxidizing conditions, the PdO

on LaFePdO3 was recovered to the perovskite crystal
lattice.
As shown in Fig. 3d, the CN of metallic Pd on Al2O3
decreased slowly and the CN of the Pd–O bond of Al2O3
also recovered slowly.
The change in the Pd state with redox ﬂuctuations that
accompanied its segregation out and solid–solution into
the perovskite crystal are extremely fast, taking only about
1 s. These rapid movements of Pd in the perovskite crystal
could be the result of the sensitivity of the perovskite crys-
tal to oxygen and prevent from the particle growth.
4. Conclusion
The dynamical changes in the Pd structure, which corre-
sponds to the movement of the Pd atom in and out of the
perovskite crystal, were measured by in situ DXAFS. Pd
movements between segregation and solid–solution with
the perovskite crystal take only about 1 s at 400 C. It
was proved that these Pd movements could respond to
the high-speed ﬂuctuations of automotive exhaust. It was
also clearly shown that the Pd metal particles segregated
from the perovskite crystal are extremely ﬁne, and the Pd
particle size is only 0.8 nm.
