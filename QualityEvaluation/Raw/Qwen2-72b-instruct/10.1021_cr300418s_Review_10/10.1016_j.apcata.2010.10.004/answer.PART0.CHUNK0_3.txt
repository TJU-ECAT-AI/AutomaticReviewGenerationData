1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. The efficiency of the catalysts is related to this surface interaction. The thermal decomposition of oxalate ions, present due to the use of ammonium oxalato niobate as the niobium precursor, induces a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry, which also influences the catalytic properties. Only a small percent of Nb is necessary to have these effects. The optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb is related to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase, which prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalyst precursors. Above 15% of Nb, the amorphous phase reacts with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation, attributed to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature. Attempt to regenerate the catalysts has failed.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质,包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态,通过影响NiO活性相与无定形Nb2O5相之间的表面相互作用,影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢中作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂的行为。催化剂的效率与这种表面相互作用有关。由于使用了铌酸铵草酸盐作为铌前体,草酸根离子的存在,伴随着上述表面相互作用,草酸根离子的热分解导致NiO氧过量减少,这也影响了催化性能。只需要少量的Nb就能产生这些效果。观察到15%的Nb具有最佳活性,这与无定形Nb2O5相导致的活性相粒径减小有关,该相在催化剂前体的热转化过程中防止了活性相粒子的烧结。当Nb含量超过15%时,无定形相与氧化镍反应,形成不活跃的混合铌镍氧化物相NiNb2O6。对催化剂在长时间内的催化性能的研究表明,NiNbO催化剂经历了缓慢但系统的失活,这归因于反应条件下NiO氧过量的连续减少以及在催化反应温度下热力学稳定的NiNb2O6相的形成。尝试再生催化剂失败了。
