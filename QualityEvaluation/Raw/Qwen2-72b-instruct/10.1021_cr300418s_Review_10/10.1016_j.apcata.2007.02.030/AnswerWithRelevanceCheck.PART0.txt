          [1] "In this work, we report an in-depth structural characterization of pure NiO and NiNbO mixed oxide catalysts (Nb/Ni = 00.25), highly active and selective materials for ethylene production via ethane ODH, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS)."
          [2] "It was found that low-temperature treatment of pure NiO leads to the formation of a non-stoichiometric oxidic phase with characteristic structural defects due to cationic deficiency, as demonstrated by microscopy results."
          [3] "On the Nb-doped oxides, two distinct structural phases, formed via the reaction of the Nb cations with the cationic vacancies, were identified: a NiO phase having Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound."
          [4] "The reduction of the structural defects in NiO via their interaction with the niobium ions was correlated with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species (O), responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2."

          The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by reacting with the cationic vacancies in NiO to form two distinct structural phases: a NiO phase with Nb cations incorporated in the host lattice, which retains its initial cubic structure (NiNb solid solution), and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The reduction of structural defects in NiO via interaction with niobium ions correlates with the extremely high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts to ethylene in the ethane ODH reaction. Challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the formation of non-stoichiometric oxidic phases with characteristic structural defects in low-temperature treated NiO, which are not always predictable or consistent with theoretical models.

          铌氧化物的多种性质，包括其各种稳定形式和氧化态，通过与NiO中的阳离子空位反应，形成两种不同的结构相，影响其在乙烷氧化脱氢NiO催化剂中的掺杂行为：一个NiO相，其中Nb阳离子被掺入主体晶格中，保持其初始的立方结构（NiNb固溶体），以及一个高度扭曲的Nb富集相，是形成混合NiNb2O6晶体化合物的前体。通过与铌离子的相互作用减少NiO中的结构缺陷与NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯的极高选择性相关联。在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察相协调的挑战在于，低温处理的NiO会形成具有特征性结构缺陷的非化学计量氧化相，这些缺陷并不总是可预测的，也不总是与理论模型一致。
