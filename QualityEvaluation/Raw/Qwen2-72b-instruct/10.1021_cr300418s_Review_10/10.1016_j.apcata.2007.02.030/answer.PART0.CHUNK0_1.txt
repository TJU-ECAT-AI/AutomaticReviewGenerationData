1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. When niobium is introduced into the NiO lattice, it reacts with the cationic vacancies, leading to the formation of two distinct structural phases: a Ni-rich crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, which retains its original crystallographic structure, and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase, precursor for the formation of the mixed NiNb2O6 crystal compound. The elimination of the NiO structural defects by niobium is responsible for the high selectivity of the NiNbO catalysts in the ethane ODH reaction to ethylene, since these vacancies lead to the formation of strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation of ethane to CO2. The insertion of Nb significantly reduces the crystallite size and consequently increases the surface area and the per weight activity of the materials. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complex nature of these catalytic systems, including the heterogeneous distribution of defects and the formation of multiple structural phases, which can affect the catalytic performance in unpredictable ways.

1.铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。当铌被引入NiO晶格时，它与阳离子空位反应，形成两种不同的结构相：一个富含Ni的结晶相，其中Nb阳离子被纳入NiO晶格，保留其原始的晶体结构，以及一个高度扭曲的Nb富集相，是形成混合NiNb2O6晶体化合物的前体。铌消除NiO结构缺陷是NiNbO催化剂在乙烷ODH反应中对乙烯具有高选择性的原因，因为这些缺陷会导致形成强烈的氧化亲电子氧物种，对乙烷的完全氧化为CO2负责。Nb的插入显著减小了晶粒尺寸，从而增加了材料的表面积和每单位重量的活性。在理论预测与实验观察之间调和的挑战源于这些催化系统的复杂性，包括缺陷的异质分布和多种结构相的形成，这可能以不可预测的方式影响催化性能。
