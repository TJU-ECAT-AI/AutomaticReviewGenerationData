These materials were then subjected to activity tests in the selective catalytic reduction of NO by propene. The catalytic performance over LaFeO3 is poor but can be improved significantly by incorporating Cu into its lattice, resulting in N2 yields over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 of 81% at 450 C and 97% at 700 C with a reactant mixture containing 3000 ppm NO, 3000 ppm C3H6, and 1% O2 in helium at a space velocity of 50,000 h1. The enhanced NO reduction after Cu substitution is attributed to the easy formation of nitrate species, which have high reactivity toward C3H6. A mechanism was proposed with the formation of nitrate species as the first step and organo nitrogen compounds as important intermediates. Great catalytic performance at low temperature was also achieved over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 with a N2 yield of 67% and C3H6 conversion of 68% at 350 C corresponding to the outstanding redox properties of this catalyst. O2 can act as a promoter to oxidize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species, and also can accelerate the transformation of organo nitrogen compounds and isocyanate to get the desired products. In contrast, at higher concentrations O2 has a detrimental effect, leading to consumption of the reducing agent by the complete oxidation of C3H6. 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Perovskite oxides, promising alternatives to supported noble metals, have attracted much attention for exhaust gas depollu- tion because of their low cost, thermal stability at rather high temperatures, great versatility, and excellent redox properties.
Most previous studies on the use of perovskites for the purifica- tion of motor vehicles exhaust gas from NOx have involved the reaction between NO and CO [13]. Much less work has been reported on NO reduction using propene as a reducing agent in the presence of oxygen over perovskite-type oxides. Moreover,the limited data related to NO + C3H6 + O2 reaction over per- ovskites shows poor catalytic performance, with maximal NO conversion to N2 of <25% [4,5]. Consequently, new efforts are needed to improve the catalytic activity toward NO reduction * Corresponding author. Fax: +1 418 656 3810.E-mail address: kaliagui@gch.ulaval.ca (S. Kaliaguine). by C3H6 in the presence of O2 over perovskites, aiming to sat- isfy the requirements for their practical application.It is well known that the catalytic characteristics of per- ovskites for various reactions and their redox properties de- pend primarily on the preparation procedure. The conven- tional method of perovskite preparation, the so-called ceramic method, involves a calcination step with a temperature of at least 800 C. As a result, large grain size and low specific sur- face area are usually obtained with a value of several m2/g or even less [6]. Some other methods for preparing perovskites,including microemulsion [7], spray-drying [8], freeze-drying [9], citrate complexation [10], co-precipitation [11], and the solgel process [12], were developed to increase the specific surface area of perovskites by means of synthesis and calci- nation at relatively low temperatures (500600 C). The spe- cific surface areas of perovskites generated by the foregoing methods can reach 1030 m2/g. Recently, a new method for perovskite preparationreactive grindinghas been proposed 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc. doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.019

369 by our group, generating a wide variety of perovskites at room temperature with extraordinarily high specific surface areas (on the order of 100 m2/g) when grinding additives are used [13 15].
The selection of B-site cations is of essential importance in designing perovskite catalysts as well as in modifying their cat- alytic properties, because the catalytic properties of perovskite- type oxides are practically determined by the nature of their B-site cations [16,17]. Fe-based perovskites were thought to be suitable catalysts for air pollution control because of their great performance in interactions between CO and NO [1], despite the scarcity of investigations into selective catalytic reduction of NO by C3H6 in the presence of O2. Moreover, B-site sub- stitution of perovskites was also considered an effective way to improve their catalytic properties due to the generation of new lattice defects, mixed valence states, and nonstoichiometric oxygen [18]. Copper-containing catalysts are of special inter- est because they are active in the transformation of nitrogen oxides [19], with the low-coordination isolated Cu ions as ac- tive sites [20,21]. In addition, the activity of Pd-substituted lanthanum cuprates was found to be comparable to that of Pt-Rh/CeO2-Al2O3 for NO reduction and higher for CO and C3H6 oxidation [22]. A special self-regeneration character on Pd-containing perovskite was also described by Nishihata et al.,who showed that Pd can move back and forth between the B-site in the perovskite and the metal oxide when exposed to fluctua- tions in the redox characteristics of the emission exhaust [23].
Cu and Pd ions, with valence states different from those of Fe ions in a perovskite lattice, thus may be interesting candidates for partial B-site substitution in LaFeO3.
In the present study, a parent LaFeO3 and its correspond- ing Cu- or Pd-substituted perovskites (LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 and LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3), synthesized by reactive grinding, were char- acterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of O2, NO +O2, and C3H6, and temperature- programmed surface reduction (TPSR) of NO + O2 under C3H6/He flow. The samples were also tested in a fixed-bed re- actor for NO reduction with propene in the presence or absence of 1% O2. This research was carried out to identify the different physicochemical properties of LaFeO3 before and after Cu or Pd substitution, as well as to illustrate the correlation between the modification of their structure and their catalytic behaviors.
Another objective of this work was to propose a reaction mech- anism for NO reduction over Fe-based perovskites.
2. Experimental
A series of Fe-based mixed oxides was synthesized by re- active grinding in a manner similar to that reported previ- ously [1315]. Desired amounts of La2O3 (Alfa, 99.99%), Fe2O3 (Baker & Adamson, 97.49%), CuO (Aldrich, 99%), or PdO (Aldrich, 99.98%) were fully mixed and milled inside a tempered-steel vial using three tempered-steel balls under an air atmosphere. Grinding was conducted in two steps of 8 h for synthesis and 10 h for refining, with ZnO as the grinding addi- tive.
The specific surface area of the samples calcined at 500 C for 5 h was determined using an automated gas sorption sys- tem (NOVA 2000; Quantachrome) through nitrogen adsorption equilibrium at 196 C. Before measurements were done, sam- ples of about 200 mg were outgassed at 300 C under vacuum for 6 h to remove any remaining humidity. The chemical com- position (Fe, Cu, Pd) of the catalysts was established by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a Perkin-Elmer 1100B spectrometer after the samples were dissolved in a mixture of 25 ml of 10% HCl and 2 ml of concentrated HF at 60 C for 24 h. The amount of La in the perovskites was measured using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer (Op- tima 4300DV; Perkin-Elmer) with the same pretreatment before analysis as used for AAS. The final products were characterized by XRD using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with Cu-Kα ra- diation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in a range 20< 2θ < 70with steps of 0.05(2θ) each for 2.4 s. Crystallite sizes were determined using Scherrers equation after considering the instrumental broadening, whereas the crystal phases were identified via the JCPDS reference. The morphology of the mixed oxides after calcination at 500 C for 5 h was recorded at 100,000× magni- fication by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a JEOL JSM 840A at 110 kV.H2-TPR and TPD of O2, NO + O2, and C3H6 were con- ducted in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor. Before perform- ing the H2-TPR study, the sample (about 50 mg) was heated to 500 C and maintained at this temperature for 1 h under 10% O2. Before performing the TPD of O2, NO + O2, and C3H6-TPD, the sample was pretreated in 10% O2, 3000 ppm NO + 1% O2, and 3000 ppm C3H6, respectively, balanced by He, at 500 C for 1 h, followed by cooling to room temperature under the same atmosphere and purging with He for 40 min.The sample was heated again from room temperature to 800 C at a rate of 5 C/min with a 20 ml/min 5% H2/Ar flow in the TPR study, and the effluent gases were monitored on-line using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A cold trap was used to remove the water from effluent gas before it went through the TCD. The sample was flushed with 20 ml/min of He at a rising temperature up to 500 C (800 C for O2-TPD) at a rate of 10 C/min in the TPD analysis. The O2, NO, N2O, and N2 desorbed during O2-TPD and NO + O2-TPD experiments were simultaneously detected and recorded on-line by mass spectrometry (MS) with mass numbers of 32, 30, 44, and 14,respectively. Moreover, C3H6, CO, and CO2 desorbed during C3H6-TPD experiments were monitored with the mass num- bers of 41, 28 and 44, respectively.TPSR of NO+O2 under C3H6/He flow over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 was performed with the same sample pretreatment used for TPD of NO + O2, but the thermodesorption was performed in 1000 ppm of C3H6/He instead of He. The desorbed C3H6, NO,and O2 together with generated CO2, N2, and H2O were moni- tored by MS with mass numbers of 41, 30, 32, 44, 14, and 18,respectively.The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by C3H6 was conducted in a tubular fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pres- sure. A gas mixture of 3000 ppm of NO, 3000 ppm of C3H6,with or without 1% O2, and the balance He, passed through 370

a catalyst bed charge of about 100 mg with a flow rate of 60 ml/min, yielding a space velocity of 50,000 h1. The re- actor was placed in a tubular furnace controlled with a tem- perature programmer connected to a K-type thermocouple in- serted inside the catalyst bed. The temperature was modified from 200 to 700 C in 50 C steps. The effluent gases (NO, N2O, NO2, and C3H6) were analyzed using a FTIR gas cell (FTLA 2000; ABB Inc.). N2 and O2 were monitored by gas chromatography (GC) (Hewlett Packard 5890) equipped with TCD and separated using columns of molecular sieve 13X com- bined with a silicone OV-101 column. Nitrogen oxides were also analyzed using a chemiluminescence NO/NO2/NOx an- alyzer (model 200AH; Advanced Pollution Instrumentation).
Organo nitrogen compounds, mentioned in the literature as in- termediates of NO reduction by hydrocarbons [2426], can be detected by comparing the NO2 values from the NOx analyzer and from the IR spectrometer. The higher NO2 value from the NOx analyzer was ascribed to the organo nitrogen compounds observed as an NO2 signal after the NO2/NO converter of this analyzer. These organo nitrogen compounds were further iden- tified by GC-MS (CP 3800-Saturn 2200; Varian) and confirmed to be composed mainly of C3H7NO2.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst physicochemical characterization
The chemical compositions of the prepared solids estab- lished by AAS and ICP were close to the nominal values (Ta- ble 1). The BET specific surface areas and pore diameters of the materials, synthesized by reactive grinding after calcina- tion at 500 C for 5 h, were determined by N2 adsorption and are also reported in Table 1. The results show a surface area about 30 m2/g for the LaFeO3 catalyst even after calcination at 500 C. This value is superior to values from similar perovskites synthesized by ceramic methods [2,27]. The surface area of lan- thanum ferrite is further enhanced upon Cu or Pd substitution,reaching a value >40 m2/g.
A nearly pure orthorhombic LaFeO3 perovskite-type struc- ture (JCPDS card 74-2203) on all prepared Fe-based cata- lysts was confirmed by XRD patterns in Fig. 1, apart from a small amount of α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS card 860550). No dif- fraction lines corresponding to PdO (JCPDS card 85-0713) or CuO (JCPDS card 80-1917) are seen, suggesting that these metals are incorporated into the LaFeO3 structure. However,the formation of tiny PdO or CuO particles, which could not be detected by XRD, cannot be excluded. The signal peak at 2θ 32in XRD patterns implies a highly symmetric lattice Fig. 1. XRD patterns of (a) LaFeO3, (b) LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3, (c) LaFe0.97 Pd0.03O3 mixed oxides. inside the perovskites generated by reactive grinding [18]. Fur- thermore, the crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrers equation, as represented in Table 1 with values <20 nm. Taking into account the fact that both the pore diameters determined by N2 adsorption and the crystallite sizes determined from XRD patterns are around 1020 nm, we thus can infer that the porous structure of the present perovskites was formed via clustering of their primary particles, in accordance with earlier findings [28].A sponge-like phase was observed by SEM (not shown) for all solids with a cluster of 50200 nm, thought to be com- posed of individual nanoscale primary particles resulting in a somewhat porous microstructure. The dispersion of perovskite clusters seems to be improved by Cu or Pd substitution, yield- ing a higher specific surface area.
3.2. H2-TPR
The reducibility of prepared samples was investigated by H2-TPR experiments, as illustrated in Fig. 2. For LaFeO3, three reduction peaks are detectable, suggesting a multiple-step re- duction. The first small peak centered at 215 C is followed by a second broad peak and a third more intense peak, overlapping substantially, with maxima at 440 and 573 C, respectively.
With 20% Cu substitution, the TPR profile of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 exhibits two reduction signals, a sharp one centered at 241 C and another centered at 460 C with shoulders at 360 and 600 C. As Fe is partially substituted by Pd, a more compli- cated reduction occurs, as shown in Fig. 2, with maxima at 78,219, 328, and 465 C, respectively.

371 Because La3+ is nonreducible under the conditions of H2- TPR, the observed H2 consumption should be ascribed to the reduction of Fen+ ions in the case of LaFeO3. A small amount of highly reducible Fe4+ has been reported in LaFeO3 [2931],and its reduction to Fe3+ occurred at T < 300 C during H2- TPR experiments [30]. The small amount of H2 consumed at 215 C in the H2-TPR profile of LaFeO3 can be attributed to the reduction of Fe4+ to Fe3+, followed by a successive re- duction of Fe3+ centered at 440 and 573 C, respectively. The quantitative analysis of these two peaks correlated well with the H2 consumption in the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. They were therefore ascribed to Fe3+ Fe2+ reduction occurring over the surface and in the bulk of LaFeO3, respectively. Subsequently,the minor reduction peak above 700 C was assigned to the partial reduction of Fe2+ to metallic iron. The formula of par- ent Fe-based perovskite was thus determined as La0.99Fe4+

0.945O3.013 based on above ascription of Fen+ reduction and
elemental analysis (see Table 1), showing 5.5% Fe4+ and little overstoichiometric oxygen present in LaFeO3. The additional peak at 241 C appearing in the case of Cu-substituted per- ovskite can be attributed to the reduction of lattice Cu2+ to Cu+, whereas the shoulder at 550 C may be possibly ascribed to the complete reduction of Cu+ to Cu0. These values are very similar to those observed in H2-TPR of Cu/MCM-41 [21], LaCo1xCuxO3, and LaMn1xCuxO3 (x = 0.1, 0.2) [32,33].
The Fe4+ reduction peak is likely completely included in the rising part of the Cu2+ Cu+ reduction peak, whereas the Fe3+ Fe2+ reduction peak is shifted to lower temperatures in Fig. 2. H2-TPR profiles of Fe-based perovskites.
Cu-substituted samples, indicating that the Cu+ ions produced at this temperature interact with the iron ion, making the latter more easily reducible. A similar reduction behavior was found over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 perovskite. An additional reduction peak was found in the LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 TPR trace at 78 C, which,according to the literature [34], corresponds to the reduction of Pd2+ to Pd0. This H2 consumption occurring at quite low tem- perature reveals the excellent redox properties of Pd-substituted perovskite, possibly leading to good catalytic performance es- pecially at low temperatures. Fe4+ Fe3+ reduction was ob- served again at 219 C along with a downward shift of Fe3+ Fe2+ reduction in the H2-TPR profile of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 with respect to that of LaFeO3.
3.3. O2-TPD
TPD of O2 over Fe-based perovskites was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 3. The amount of O2 released from perovskites was calculated after deconvolution of the O2 des- orption curve and are listed in Table 2. Only a small amount of O2 desorbed from LaFeO3 at T < 700 C; this is designated as α-O2 and ascribed to oxygen species weakly bound to the surface of the perovskite [14]. More O2 desorption observed at T > 700 C is referred to as β-O2, which is liberated from the lattice [14]. In the case of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3, a curve similar to that of LaFeO3 was obtained apart from an obvious enhance- ment of β-O2 desorption. Surprisingly, a broad and plateau-like α-O2 desorption peak at 250700 C, along with a sharp β-O2 Fig. 3. TPD of O2 profiles over Fe-based perovskites.

desorption maximum at 796 C, were observed in the O2-TPD profile over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3. This significant enhancement of adsorbed α-O2 desorption is likely related to surface oxygen vacancies generated on Cu substitution.
3.4. NO + O2-TPD
Figs. 4ad show the desorption signals of NO (m/e = 30), N2O (m/e = 44), N2 (m/e = 14), and O2 (m/e = 32) during the NO + O2-TPD process after adsorption at room tempera- ture under 3000 ppm NO and 1% O2 for the three Fe-containing perovskites. Deconvolution of the NO + O2-TPD profiles was performed using Lorentzian peak shapes in a computer peak- fitting routine. The amounts of NO, N2O, N2, and O2 desorbed from perovskites were calculated based on these deconvolutions and are reported in Table 3. Three overlapping NO desorption peaks were observed for LaFeO3 with maxima at 176, 272, and 360 C, respectively. A similar NO desorption curve was ob- served over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3, except that its low-temperature peak was shifted upward and the third peak centered at 364 C was slightly enhanced. A significant increase in the intensity of the third peak was found after Cu substitution. The N2O and N2 desorption (Figs. 4b and c) were detectable over the same range, 80320 C, followed by O2 desorption at T > 330 C over Fe-based perovskites (Fig. 4d).
3.5. C3H6-TPD
The MS signals of C3H6 (m/e = 41), CO (m/e = 28), and CO2 (m/e = 44) during the TPD of C3H6 experiments over Fe-based perovskites are recorded in Figs. 5ac. A quantitative analysis of the various gases desorbed from perovskites is pre- sented in Table 4. One sharp peak for C3H6 desorption at 60 C,and only minor CO or CO2 desorption, are observed in the C3H6-TPD profile for LaFeO3. C3H6 desorption is obviously decreased over the Cu-substituted perovskite, in combination with a significant CO2 desorption with a maximum at 435 C.
This result implies that C3H6 transformation via complete ox- idation into adsorbed CO2 was promoted by Cu substitution.
Taking into account the result that α-oxygen of Fe-based per- ovskites can be significantly enhanced by Cu substitution (see Fig. 3), it was thus thought that α-oxygen adsorbed on oxy- gen vacancies plays an important role in the transformation of C3H6 into CO2. A similar diminution of C3H6 desorption was (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 4. TPD of NO + O2 profiles over Fe-based perovskites. MS signal of (a) NO, (b) N2O, (c) N2, (d) O2.

However, drastic increases in both CO and CO2 desorption were achieved over this catalyst at T > 200 C, suggesting that LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 is catalyzing not only the complete oxidation of C3H6 into CO2, but also the partial oxidation of C3H6 into CO. This is likely related to the high reducibility of Pd2+ in lattice, as illustrated by the H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 2).

The TPSR of adsorbed NO + O2 in C3H6/He flow over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 is presented in Fig. 6. A large amount of oxy- gen desorbs from the perovskite surface under an atmosphere of 1000 ppm C3H6/He. This signal rapidly declines at 240280 C simultaneously with the consumption of C3H6. At T < 300 C,374

Conditions: flow rate = 20 ml/min, 3000 ppm NO, 1% O2, 1000 ppm C3H6. the NO desorption features are similar to those shown in Fig. 4a for the thermodesorption of NO; however, the third NO desorp- tion peak at T > 300 C seen in Fig. 4a is not present in Fig. 6.
Some N2 desorption is observed simultaneously with the NO desorption at T < 300 C. The appearance of CO2 coincides with the disappearance of C3H6.
3.7. Activity tests
The temperature dependence of NO conversion to N2 over the three Fe-based perovskites is shown in Fig. 7a. Over unsub- stituted LaFeO3, the conversion to N2 begins to be significant at 350 C and increases progressively with increasing tempera- ture, reaching 62% at 700 C. A considerably enhanced conver- sion to N2 was observed over lanthanum ferrite after Cu sub- stitution, resulting in initiation at 350 C and reaching values of 81% at 450 C and 97% at 700 C. A remarkable conver- sion to N2, occurring at 250 C and reaching as high as 67% at 350 C, was achieved over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3. Organo nitro- gen compounds were detected in the effluent at high temper- ature, with a maximum yield of 36% over LaFeO3, 14% over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3, and 42% over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3, as depicted in Fig. 7b. These organo nitrogen compounds are widely men- tioned in the literature as intermediates during SCR of NO by hydrocarbons [2426]. The detection of these organo nitrogen compounds is simultaneous with a decrease in the conversion to N2, as can be seen by comparing Figs. 7a and b. The con- version of C3H6, shown in Fig. 7c, increases progressively up to 80% at 200500 C. The conversion level at T < 500 C was significantly improved after Cu and Pd substitution, re- sulting in C3H6 conversion of 63 and 68%, respectively, at 300 C. Some CO formation was observed at high temperature,increasing in the following order: LaFeO3 < LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 < LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 (Fig. 7d).Fig. 8 presents the catalytic performance of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 in NO reduction by C3H6 in absence of oxygen, showing a max- imum N2 yield (70%) at 350 C followed by a decline (54%) at 450 C and a final development (95%) at 700 C. C3H6 con- version increased monotonically at rising temperature, reaching a plateau of approximately 45% at 500600 C and then ris- ing continuously to almost 96% at 700 C. Organo nitrogen compounds were found during this reaction, with a maximum of 30% at 450 C over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3. Accompanied by the decreased yield of organo nitrogen compounds, CO formation became obvious at T > 450 C and then reached about 30% at higher temperatures.Yields of N2 and organo nitrogen compounds and C3H6 con- versions as functions of O2 concentration over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at 400 C are shown in Fig. 9 to clarify the role of gaseous O2 during SCR of NO. With an increase in O2 concentration, the maximum N2 yield was about 76% at 3000 ppm O2. Other au- thors have reported similar results for the effect of O2 in SCR of NO by C3H6 for La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Cu0.5O3/Al2O3 at 375 C [35] and Cu/ZSM-5 at 300 C [36]. The yield of organo nitro- gen compounds decreases rapidly, from 23% in absence of O2 to 1% at 5000 ppm O2. In contrast, increasing O2 concentration results in a monotonic increase in C3H6 conversion.
4. Discussion
4.1. O2-TPD
The mobility of O2 over Fe-based perovskites was investi- gated via O2-TPD experiments; the results are given in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The lowest α- and β-O2 desorption was obtained over LaFeO3 among the three Fe-based perovskites, implying poor molecular O2 coverage and lattice oxygen reducibility of lanthanum ferrite, in accordance with previous reports [37,38]. The substitution of 20% Fe3+ by Cu2+ leads to a pos- itive charge deficiency, which is compensated for by oxygen vacancies, resulting in significant enhancement of α-O2. The β-oxygen of the Cu-substituted sample was also enhanced due to the improvement of its reducibility via Cu incorporation, as already confirmed by H2-TPR experiments (Fig. 2). A similar effect was also found in the substitution of Fe3+ by Pd2+. Note

This likely corresponds to the highly reducible Pd2+ promoting the mobility of lattice O2, as observed in H2-TPR of LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 (Fig. 2). Based on our earlier description [14], the following process was assumed to occur during calcination of LaFeO3 perovskite.

(4) In Eqs. (1)(4), iron ions are indicated here as examples. In the substituted samples, pairs of one Fen+ and one Cu2+ or Pd2+ are also present. Reactions (1) and (3) may therefore happen on these new ion pairs. Reactions (3) and (4) also occur in the coordination sphere of copper or palladium ions.
The β-oxygen desorbed above 700 C, as previously re- ported for similar compounds [38], is defined as the oxygen liberated from the lattice, leaving oxygen bulk vacancies and reduced cations. The amount of β-oxygen desorbed is thus gen- erally considered a measure of lattice oxygen mobility.

(7) In LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3, the amount of β-oxygen desorbed at 700 800 C was 202 mol/g, which is half the theoretical oxy- gen corresponding to complete copper reduction to the metal (409 mol/g). It seems thus that the β-oxygen thermodesorp- tion corresponds to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ as suggested by reaction (7).
4.2. NO + O2-TPD
Various bands assigned to mononitrosyl, dinitrosyl, and ni- trite or nitrate species were found in IR spectroscopy studies of NO adsorbed over LaFeO3 perovskites [39]. The forma- tion of nitrosyl, nitrite, or nitrate species during NO-TPD over Cu/MCM-41 was also observed in our previous work [21]. In the present work, the species adsorbed during co-adsorption of NO and O2 over Fe-based perovskites were investigated by monitoring the MS signals of NO, N2O, N2, and O2 in the efflu- ents of NO + O2 experiments (Figs. 4ad). The amounts of the various species desorbed were quantified and listed in Table 3.
Although the NO desorption traces (m/e = 30) for Fe-based perovskites, reported in Fig. 4a, show essentially three overlap- ping peaks, the oxygen traces (Fig. 4d; m/e = 32) show that oxygen desorbs simultaneously with only the high-temperature NO peak in amounts that are essentially enhanced after Pd and Cu substitution (see Table 3). It is remarkable that the high- temperature NO peaks and O2 peaks are essentially located at the same temperature and that even the shapes of the peaks look alike. Coq et al. [40] reported that the desorption of NO3 species would appear as a NO desorption peak at high tempera- ture (T > 300 C) with parallel O2 desorption. Furthermore, the moles of NO desorbed at the high-temperature peak are plotted against those of O2 (Table 3) in Fig. 10. Given the imprecise nature of the curve fitting of NO traces, the data are reasonably
R. Zhang et al. / Journal of Catalysis 237 (2006) 368380
377 well fitted with a line of slope 1, indicating that the NO/O2 ra- tio is essentially 1 over these catalysts. This strongly suggests that high-temperature NO desorption is associated with the des- orption of an oxidized nitrogen oxide species with a general formula of NO3. The oxidation of NO was likely realized by α-oxygen as O2ion radicals formed during calcination and O2 adsorption,
O2
Fen+ + NO Fen+.
(8) Compared with Fig. 3, no α-oxygen desorbing at T < 300 C is observed in Fig. 4d, suggesting that reaction (8) involving α-oxygen occurs during the NO + O2-TPD process.The desorption of nitrate species leads to the formation of NO and O2 with a molar ratio NO/O2 equal to 1, Fen+ Fen+ Fen+ + O2 Fen+ + O2 Fe(n1)+2 + NO + O2. (9) Besides the NO desorption related to nitrate species, the other two peaks in the NO traces of NO + O2-TPD (Fig. 4a) show similar features among the three Fe-based perovskites, as does the desorption of N2O and N2 at 100300 C (Figs. 4b and c).The thermal stability of nitrogen-containing adspecies over Cu/ZSM-5 was enhanced with an increasing oxidation state of nitrogen [19]. In addition, both mononitrosyl and dinitrosyl species were weakly adsorbed on the same catalyst compared to nitrate species [41]. Therefore, the former two NO desorp- tions likely correspond to mononitrosyl and dinitrosyl species,respectively.
4.3. C3H6-TPD
C3H6 surface oxidation, which was enhanced by Cu sub- stitution, was observed during C3H6 desorption over Fe-based perovskites, likely realized via suprafacial oxidation by α-O2 bonded to anion vacancies. Based on our C3H6-TPD study, the following scheme may be proposed for the adsorption of C3H6 over perovskites. Using the site described by the left hand side of Eq. (3), the olefine should adsorb on the electron-deficient part of the site, as described in Eq. (10). The OC3H6· radical (allylic adspecies) formed can now react with the surrounding α-O2 to form CO2 and water, as described previously [42],

(10) C3H6 adsorbed on the surface of the Pd-substituted sample can be transformed not only into CO2 via complete oxidation, but also into CO via partial oxidation according to the C3H6-TPD experiments (Figs. 5ac). The CO formation by hydrocarbon oxidation over Cu/ZSM-5 was reported to occur especially at low temperatures and to be higher from alkenes than from alka- nes [43]. Although less abundant α-O2 can be obtained over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 than over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 according to O2- TPD experiments shown in Fig. 3, a higher content of adsorbed carbonaceous species was observed (see Table 4), indicating that the C3H6 transformation over Pd-substituted catalyst in- volves not only α-O2, but also highly mobile lattice O2, due to the excellent redox properties of this catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 2, Fen+ + 6O23CO + 3H2O +

4.4. TPSR of NO + O2 under C3H6/He flow
Fig. 6 clearly shows that the NO desorption features ob- served at T < 300 C are similar to the two peaks assigned to mononitrosyl and dinitrosyl species in the TPD of NO + O2 (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, the NO desorption at high temperature (T > 300 C) in Fig. 4a ascribed to nitrate species is no longer present in the traces of Fig. 6. This result implies that only the nitrate species among the adsorbed NO is highly active to- ward C3H6 and is completely consumed by this reducing agent.A significant NO conversion was indeed found in the activity tests at temperatures above 350 C (Fig. 7a). At such high tem- peratures, only the nitrate species is present on the perovskite surface, another indication of the high reactivity of the nitrate species in the C3H6-SCR process.As seen in Fig. 6, molecular oxygen desorbs even in the pres- ence of C3H6 in the gas phase for temperatures below 260 C,suggesting that the surface oxidation that consumes α-oxygen is not completed below this temperature. The CO2 formed by this reaction desorbs from the surface essentially above 260 C, in- dicating that either CO2 or an oxygenated carbonaceous species leading to its formation is adsorbed on the perovskite surface above 260 C.N2 was also detected during this experiment, again suggest- ing that reduction of the nitrate surface species by propene is associated with the SCR process. 378

4.5. Activity tests and reaction mechanism
Among the three Fe-based perovskite samples, the worst NO conversion to N2 was achieved over unsubstituted LaFeO3,with a significant NO reduction starting at 350 C (where ni- trate is the only remaining species over perovskites, according to the NO + O2-TPD study) and a maximum of 62% at 700 C (Fig. 7a). The high activity of nitrate species in reaction with propene was established via TPSR of NO + O2 in C3H6/He tests, indicating that the formation of nitrate species is the first important step in NO reduction. This is in agreement with our previous findings in C3H6-SCR of NO over Cu-MCM-41 [21], LaCo1xCuxO3 [32], and LaMn1xCuxO3 [33]. Furthermore,organo nitrogen compounds, identified as composed mainly of 1-nitropropane (C3H7NO2) by GC-MS (typical composition:92% C3H7NO2, 4% C2H5N=CO isocyanate, 2% C2H5NO2,1% CH3ONO, 0.5% C3H7ONO, and 0.5% HCN), were de- tected at 550700 C during NO reduction over lanthanum fer- rite (Fig. 7b), strongly implying a mechanism with organo nitro- gen compounds as intermediates. The formation of organo ni- trogen compounds via reaction of adsorbed hydrocarbons with the surface nitrate was reported as the rate-determining step in the SCR of the NO process [4446]. The rate of nitrate con- sumption was also proven to be close to that of N2 formation over Ce/ZSM-5 [46] and Al2O3 [47] according to FTIR kinetic studies. Hence the formation of 1-nitropropane should involve a reaction between the adsorbed species formed in reaction (10) and the nitrate species, Fen+ + Fen+

(12) A significantly improved N2 yield was achieved after Cu in- corporation into the B site of Fe-based perovskite. Besides the essential distinct effect of copper ions in the transformation of nitrogen oxides [19], Cu substitution promoted the forma- tion of nitrate species due to the enhancement of α-oxygen,thereby further accelerating the generation of organo nitrogen compounds from nitrate and adsorbed propene, which is be- lieved to be the rate-determining step in the SCR of NO by
C3H6.
The reactivity of 1-nitropropane was investigated by Haj et al. [48]. This compound was found to be more rapidly de- composed in O2 or NO + O2 compared with C3H6, the final products being N2, CO2, and H2O. This finding supports the fact that such species are highly reactive in the presence of
O2. Over Fe-based perovskites, the organo nitrogen compounds
were detectable only in the gas phase at higher temperatures compared with N2 formation. This seems to indicate a desorp- tion rate of organo nitrogen compounds at 350400 C over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 too low to allow detection. Based on a sug- gestion of Blower and Smith [49], further transformation of RNO2 into isocyanate (RNCO) by a cyclic intermediate may be formulated as
H2O
O=C=NC2H5.
(13) Finally, C2H5NCO was proposed to react with NO via the cou- pling of nitrogen atoms to yield the product of N2 and CO2 according to the assumption of Witzel et al [43]. At the same time, the participation of O2 (especially α-oxygen) can pro- mote the oxidation of the ethyl group into CO2 and H2O and accelerate the formation of N2,
O=C=NC2H5 + NO
+ 13
4 O2
N2 + 3CO2 + 5
2H2O.
(14) As the temperature rises above 450 C, more organo nitrogen compounds are generated. These compounds accumulate over the surface of the Cu-substituted sample and even desorb into the gas phase, because they cannot transform into isocyanate fast enough, leading to a decline in N2 formation due to the decreasing coverage of surface active sites.
Among the three Fe-based perovskites tested, the best cat- alytic performance at low temperature was observed over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 (Figs. 7ad), yielding the highest N2 yield (approximately 67% at 350 C) and the highest C3H6 con- version at T < 400 C. The C3H6-TPD study revealed that the highest content of adsorbed carbonaceous species can be achieved over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3, followed not only by com- plete oxidation of C3H6 into CO2 promoted by α-O2, but also by partial oxidation of C3H6 into CO. This partial oxidation was related to the highly reducible lattice oxygen associated with Pd2+, with the result that more CO was yielded over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 during the SCR of NO (Fig. 7d). CO has been widely mentioned as an effective reducing agent to re- duce NO at relatively low temperature with respect to C3H6 [1,3]. On the other hand, CO was reported to directly react with NO to form isocyanate (NCO) and final products [43,50]. This pathway avoids the formation of organo nitrogen compounds at relatively higher temperatures, resulting in outstanding activity at low temperatures. The abundant concentration of organo ni- trogen compounds observed in the Pd-containing sample shown in Fig. 7b was ascribed to its higher ability in the formation of organo nitrogen compounds compared with LaFeO3 and its lower ability to decompose organo nitrogen compounds com- pared with LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 due to a lower surface density of α-O2. Generally, the outstanding catalytic characteristics of Pd- substituted perovskite for NO removal at low temperature were attributed mainly to its excellent redox properties (confirmed in the H2-TPR study shown in Fig. 2), which can initiate the
R. Zhang et al. / Journal of Catalysis 237 (2006) 368380
379 redox reaction with a small energy barrier, leading to a partial oxidation of C3H6 into CO at low temperatures.
4.6. The role of O2 in catalytic behavior of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3
Several points can be raised about the crucial role of O2 based on the proposed mechanism. As a promoter, O2 can ox- idize NO into strongly adsorbed nitrate species and thus ac- celerate the formation of organo nitrogen compounds and iso- cyanate. As an inhibitor, O2 can lead to the consumption of the reducing agent by the complete oxidation of C3H6. Ueda and Haruta reported that NO reduction with C3H6 barely occurs without oxygen over Au/Al2O3 [51], whereas in the present work we obtained a satisfying NO reduction by C3H6 in the absence of O2 over LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 perovskite (see Fig. 8),achieving a higher N2 yield at T < 400 C and a quite lower C3H6 conversion compared with those in the presence of 1%
O2. The maximum yield of 30% in organo nitrogen compounds
shifted down to 450 C, and more CO was formed under this reducing atmosphere. A detailed study of the effect of O2 on catalytic performance of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at 400 C is reported in Fig. 9, showing that NO conversion to N2 passes through a maximum at 3000 ppm O2, then tends to decline at higher O2 concentrations. Taking into account the tendency toward in- creasing yields of N2 and decreasing yields of organo nitrogen compounds at O2 concentrations <3000 ppm, the observed in- crease in N2 yield at low O2 concentration can be ascribed to an acceleration of the decomposition of organo nitrogen com- pounds. In contrast, N2 yields will be severely inhibited at O2 concentrations >5000 ppm, because the unselective combus- tion of the reducing agent with O2 becomes faster than the NO-SCR over Fe-based perovskites and diminishes the number of reductant molecules remaining for the SCR reaction. Indeed, Fig. 9 shows significant C3H6 consumption with increasing O2 concentration.
5. Conclusion
In the current study, LaFeO3 and the corresponding Cu- or Pd-substituted perovskites were synthesized by reactive grind- ing with nanoscale particle sizes <20 nm and high specific surface areas >30 m2/g even after calcination at 500 C for 5 h. Cu substitution of 20% Fe3+ in B sites leads to a positive charge deficiency that is compensated for by oxygen vacancies,resulting in significantly enhanced α-O2 adsorption. The for- mation of nitrate species, which is highly reactive toward C3H6 according to TPSR tests, can be realized via oxidation of NO by α-O2. Complete oxidation of C3H6 into CO2 can also be promoted by this α-O2.
Incorporation of Pd into B sites significantly improves the mobility of lattice O2 and the reducibility of Fe-based per- ovskites. C3H6 transformation over Pd-substituted samples in- volves not only complete oxidation into CO2 via α-O2, but also partial oxidation into CO due to highly mobile lattice oxygen.
NO reduction by propene over Fe-based perovskites is con- trolled mainly by a mechanism involving organo nitrogen com- pounds, likely generated from the interaction between nitrate species and adsorbed C3H6. Subsequently, an isocyanate in- termediate forms from organo nitrogen compounds and reacts with NO and/or O2 to get the final products. With respect to LaFeO3, the better performance achieved over Cu-substituted perovskite can be ascribed to the enhanced formation of nitrate species. High SCR activity over LaFe0.97Pd0.03O3 is observed at T < 350 C, suggesting a possible pathway involving the generation of isocyanate (NCO) by direct NOCO interaction at low temperatures. This CO formation by propene oxidation readily occurs over Pd-substituted perovskites due to its out- standing redox properties.A study of the effect of gaseous O2 on the catalytic perfor- mance of LaFe0.8Cu0.2O3 at 400 C revealed that low O2 con- centrations can accelerate the decomposition of organo nitrogen compounds, resulting in improved NO reduction and C3H6 ox- idation, whereas higher O2 partial pressure reduces the yield of N2 by depleting the reducing agent though complete C3H6 ox- idation.
