X-ray powder diffraction characterization indicates that all samples are of single phase with cubic symmetry. The high-temperature electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample.

Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K.

1. Introduction
Oxide thermoelectric materials have drawn much attention in recent years because of their high thermal stability, lower cost and no toxicity. Both high electrical power factor and low thermal conductivity have been found in p-type oxide materials such as NaCo2O4 and Ca3Co4O9 materials [15]. On the other hand, n-type oxide thermoelectric materials are inevitably required as a counter-partner of the p-type oxide materials for build-up thermoelectric modules. It has been reported that n- type lanthanum-doped SrTiO3 single crystal exhibits high power factor, which is comparable with that of BiTe alloy at room temperature [6]. Rare earth doped SrTiO3 ceramics have been prepared and their thermoelectric properties have been studied [7]. The most appropriate amount of lanthanum has been estimated as about 10 mol% by considering the contributions of electronic thermal conductivity. The figure of merit can be enhanced, if its thermal conductivity could be reduced. Fortunately, a relatively low thermal conductivity about 3W/mK at 1000 K has been achieved in niobium-doped SrTiO3 epitaxial film [8]. The figure of merit for SrTi0.8Nb0.2O3 has reached 0.37 at 1000 K, which was the largest value among n-type oxide semiconductors ever reported then. Normally the thermal conductivity is associated to the ion mass difference between dopant and matrix [9]. In this sense, tantalum doping may reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in comparison with niobium doping, hence improving the figure of merit. To confirm this issue, tantalum doped Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramic samples have been prepared in this work, and their thermo- electric properties have been investigated.

After the wet mixtures have been dried, they are pressed into pellets, and calcined at 1350 8C for 6 h in ambient.
The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at 1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol% hydrogen. The sintered discs are cut into rectangular columns with geometry 20 mm  1.8 mm  1.8 mm for measurements.
Crystal structure is characterized by X-ray powder diffrac- tion with Cu Ka radiation (l = 0.154056 nm) utilizing a Bruker AXS D8 advance diffractometer. The surface morphology is obtained on a S4800 scanning electronic microscope (SEM).
Electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured simultaneously in the temperature range of 3001100 K using a ULVAC ZEM-3 equipment in Helium atmosphere. Thermal diffusivity and specific capacity are measured by a laser flash apparatus (Netzsch LFA 427) and a different thermal analyzer (Netzsch STA 449C), respectively. The thermal conductivity is calculated from the thermal diffusivity, the specific heat capacity, and the sample density. The figure of merit is calculated from above measured the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity.
3. Results and discussion
X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample,
indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound. Referred to the PDF card of No. 35-0734, all samples are of single phase in cubic symmetry. The major diffraction peaks can be indexed with the cubic perovskite structure belonging to the Pm3m space group. All the peaks in Fig. 1 slightly shift to small angle position with the increase of tantalum content, implies that the lattice is expanded by the doped tantalum. The lattice constants and lattice volumes are calculated and presented in Fig. 2. The lattice constant of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 is 3.9067 A , which is in agreement with that of early report [7]. With the increase of tantalum content, the lattice constants and lattice volumes increase. The formation of Ti3+ can be considered by Ta doping,using the KrogerVink notation as Sr0.9La0.1(Tax 5+- Ti1xy 4+Tiy 3+)O3. Although the ionic radius for Ti4+ and Ta5+ are same of 0.68 A , the content of Ti3+ may increase with increase of Ta5+, and the ionic radius of Ti3+ (0.76 A ) is larger.
The theoretical density of all samples is calculated from the lattice constants. The relative density, which is the measured density over the theoretical density, are 89.2%, 87.6%, 85.9%,
87.8% for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. The
fluctuation of density is not much large. Therefore, we may not consider the effect of porous on the thermoelectric properties described in the later.Fig. 3ad is scanning electronic microscope (SEM) images of surface microstructures for Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics. These images exhibit the typical morphology of sintered ceramics obtained by the solid state reaction. We can see from these SEM images that the grain size decreases with the increase of tantalum. The density was measured by the Archimedes method, which are 4.7024 g/cm3,
4.6850 g/cm3, 4.6195 g/cm3, 4.5819 g/cm3, 4.7394 g/cm3 for
x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively.Temperature depen- dence of the electrical resistivity of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 is shown in Fig. 4. The electrical resistivity for Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 ceramic is lower than that in an early report [7], especially in high temperature range. The electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of temperature when temperature is lower than 500 K, but increases with further increasing of the temperature. Their semiconductivity behavior in low tempera- ture is in accordance with the reports of polycrystalline sample [7]. As similar behavior has not been observed in single crystal samples [6], the semiconductivity behavior can be due to the scattering of grain boundaries [7]. With small mount of tantalum substitution, the electrical resistivity is not effectively changed, see curves for x = 0.01 and 0.03 in Fig. 4, though there is a small reduction of the electrical resistivity in high temperature end. The decrease of resistivity can be explained by the KrogerVink equation. The KrogerVink reaction is 2Ta2O5 ! 4Ta Ti  10O o  V4 Ti , where Ta Ti represent donor doping center.
Therefore, Ta doping can increase the concentration of carriers, and decrease the electrical resistivity.

2610 x = 0.05, the electrical resistivity is much increased. This behavior is similar with that of the niobium and tantalum doped CaMnO3 system [10]. Though tantalum doping can introduce more carriers, it also introduces scattering centers, especially at high doping level. With the increase of tantalum content, this strong scattering may become dominating factor for electron conduction, resulting in increase of electrical resistivity. By fitting the resistivity to a power law relationship (r(T)  r0) / Tg [11] in high temperatures range, we obtained that g = 2.5, 2.6,
2.8, 2.9 for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. The electrical
resistivity increases with temperature in a much quicker manner in high temperature range. The minimum value of electrical resistivity shifts to higher temperature as more tantalum is doped,and the lowest value of electrical resistivity is 1.4 mV cm for x = 0.01 of tantalum contents.
The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is shown in Fig. 5. The values of Seebeck coefficient are all negative, indicating of n-type electrical conduction. With the increasing of tantalum content, the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient decreases. This could be attributed to the increase of carrier concentration as more tantalum doped. In addition, we notice that the absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing of the lattice constants as shown in Fig. 2. This behavior is similar to what is observed in samples of Lanthanum doped SrTiO3 single crystalline [12]. The Seebeck coefficient is nearly a linear function of temperature from
300 K
to
1100 K.
The linear relationship of Seebeck coefficients with temperature implies a metallic behavior of the electron conduction, and can be expressed as [11,13,14].

2611 where EF is the Fermi level, and kB and e are Boltzmann constant and electron charge, respectively. This formula indi- cates that the Seebeck coefficient is inversely proportional to Fermi level EF. By fitting the experimental data in Fig. 5 with Eq. (1) using the least square method, we obtain the values of the Fermi level. They are 0.348 eV, 0.367 eV, 0.372 eV,
0.378 eV for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, respectively. This
means that the tantalum doping increases the Fermi level in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3. When Ta5+ substitutes Ti4+ in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3,the Ta5+ is expected to behave as donor ion. This leads to the increase of carrier concentration, and shift of the occupied energy level structure to higher binding energy. Therefore, the Fermi level will increase with the increasing of tantalum content.
The temperature dependence of the power factors are presented in Fig. 6. The power factors for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03 increase with the increasing temperature, reach a maximum,and then slightly decrease with further increase of temperature.
The power factor of x = 0.05 still increases with increasing temperature. The un-doped sample still maintains the highest values of power factor. The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum content. The maximum of power factor for ceramic samples decreases from 1247 mW/K2m for x = 0.00 to 509 mW/K2m for x = 0.05. The reduction of the power factor with tantalum substitution is the result of the reduction of absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient.
Temperature dependence of total thermal conductivity is shown in Fig. 7a. The electronic thermal conductivity is shown in Fig. 7b, which is calculated from WiedemannFranz law ke = LT/r, with Lorentz number L = 2.44  108 V2 K2 for free electrons. The thermal conductivity at room-temperature is about 6.1 W/mK for un-doped sample. This value is more or lees the same as that from Muta et al. [15]. The thermal conductivity decreases monotonically with increasing of temperature. The tantalum substitution does reduce the thermal conductivity. Doping contents of x = 0.03 has the optimized effect for reducing the thermal conductivity. The value of the thermal conductivity for x = 0.03 decreases from 5.5 W/mK at 328 K to 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K, which is the lowest thermal conductivity in our samples. The lowest value of the thermal conductivity in sample of x = 0.03 is resulted from the reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. Since the thermal conductivity can be expressed by the sum of lattice contribution (kL) and electronic contribution (ke) as k = kL + ke. As can be seen in Fig. 6b, the electronic thermal conductivity makes a small contribution to the total thermal conductivity, In room temperature, we estimate the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics is about
3.8%, 4.8%, 4.7%, 1.8%, for x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05,
respectively. This means that the total thermal conductivity comes mainly from the lattice vibrations. Therefore, the decrease of thermal conductivity mainly comes from the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity by doping tantalum.
Temperature dependence of dimensionless figure of merit ZT is shown in Fig. 8 for different tantalum substitutions. We can see that ZT value for all samples increases with increasing temperature monotonically. The ZT value for x = 0.01 sample nearly same with that for x = 0.00, except for a slightly reduction at the high temperatures. For x = 0.03 and 0.05 samples, the reduction of ZT values with tantalum doping is quite obviously. That means tantalum doping in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1O3 contents do not have positive effect from point view of ZT values. Although the thermal conductivity is reduced by introducing of tantalum, the much more reduction of the power factor finally reduces the ZT values.

4. Summary
We prepared the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 ceramics. All the samples are of cubic perovskite
symmetry with the lattice parameter increases with increasing tantalum content. The effects of tantalum substitution for titanium on the thermoelectric properties are investigated at temperatures from 300 K to 1100 K. We find that the absolute Seebeck coefficient obviously decreases gradually with the tantalum substitution. Therefore, the power factor is lower than that of un-doped sample. The thermal conductivity is decreased by tantalum substitution, and this behavior confirms our previous idea. However, the thermoelectric performance has not been improved by the tantalum doping in our work.
