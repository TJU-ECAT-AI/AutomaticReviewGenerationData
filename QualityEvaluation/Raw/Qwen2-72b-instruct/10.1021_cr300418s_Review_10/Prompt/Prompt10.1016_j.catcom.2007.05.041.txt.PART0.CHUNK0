1. Introduction
Automotive catalysts deteriorate as a result of a decrease in the active surface area of the precious metals caused by grain growth in the high-temperature reduc- tionoxidation (redox) fluctuations of the exhaust gas. To compensate for this deterioration, conventional catalysts are loaded with excess amounts of precious metals, but this leads to over-consumption of precious metals and to prob- lems in their supply. Pdperovskite catalysts can maintain a high activity through a self-regeneration function in which Pd forms a solidsolution with the perovskite crystal and then becomes segregated from the perovskite crystal.
These movements of Pd would occur in response to the redox conditions of the environment [18].
In previous experiments, samples were pretreated in oxi- dative, reductive, and re-oxidative atmospheres for 1 h each and then the local structures and valence states of Pd were measured by standard X-ray absorption fine-struc- ture (XAFS) analysis [1,68]. These experiments suggested that Pd moves in and out of perovskite crystal, but did not show the speed of movement of the Pd.
Energy-dispersive X-ray absorption fine-structure (DXAFS) is a useful technique for investigating the dynamical change in local structures and valence states [912]. We have previously reported the preliminary results of an in situ DXAFS experiment with a temporal resolu- tion of about 1 s [13]. These results suggested that Pd changes in its state at a higher speed than this resolution,so a high-speed analysis was needed to know how the Pd moves qualitatively. Here, we show by direct observation using in situ DXAFS analysis with a time resolution of 10 ms that this phenomenon can occur at an extremely 1566-7367/$ - see front matter  2007 Elsevier B.V.

2. Experimental
A Pd-containing perovskite-type catalyst, LaFe0.90- Pd0.10O3 (LaFePdO3), was prepared by the alkoxide method.
A
solution of metal ethoxyethylates [M3+(OC2H4OC2H5)3] of La, Fe and palladium acetylacet- onate [Pd2+(CH3COCHCOCH3)2] in toluene was hydro- lyzed with deionized water to give a Pd-containing precipitate. This precursor was dried and then calcined at 800 C for 2 h in air to give a perovskite powder catalyst containing homogeneously distributed Pd.
To prepare the conventional catalysts, powdered c- Al2O3 was impregnated with dilute aqueous Pd(NO3)2 then dried and calcined at 500 C for 1 h in the air.
X-ray absorption spectra were measured at beamline ID 24, ESRF, France [12]. The silicon polychrometer crystal was set to the Bragg configuration with the (311) reflection plane to obtain a dispersed X-ray beam near the Pd K-edge (24.347 keV). A pellet of each sample was located at the focus of the dispersed X-ray beam. The transmitted X- ray intensity was detected by a charge-coupled device camera with a fluorescent screen. The XAFS spectra were consecutively measured for 5 s with a resolution of 10 ms.
A pellet of each sample was placed in a quartz tube (/ = 5.0 mm). 50% O2 (balanced with He) was used as the oxidizing gas, and 50% H2 (balanced with He) was used as the reducing gas. The total gas flow rate was set at 100 cm3 min1. This reducing gas concentration, relative to the amount of Pd, was considered to be equivalent to that of an actual engine exhaust gas (Table 1) [14]. A ther- mal conductivity detector (TCD) was located in front of the quartz tube. A trigger signal from the TCD, which detects the difference in the thermal conductivity of the gases, was used to start the measurements. The samples were heated to 400 C by an infrared furnace. Fig. 1 shows the gas sequence and the temperature conditions. The insertion of He as a purge gas was programmed to prevent the production of an explosive gas mixture. Just after switching the gas flow to reducing or to oxidizing, spectra were measured for 5 s at 400 C. After measurement under oxidizing conditions, the temperature was raised to 700 C in 50% O2 (balanced with He) gas flow for 30 s to com- pletely restore the Pd to the perovskite crystal lattice. To improve the counting statistics, measurements were carried out continually over ten repetitions of the reducingoxidiz- ing cycle, and XAFS spectra were accumulated ten times.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of the radial distribution function around Pd, which was obtained by Fourier trans- form of the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations, typically in the range of k values from 3.0 A 1 to 8.0 A
1. There are
two peaks in each samples corresponding to the PdO bond and the PdPd bond, respectively. The PdO bond of LaFePdO3 originates from the B-site of the perovskite structure [1,7], whereas the PdO bond of Pd/Al2O3 origi- nates from PdO [1,7]. The PdPd bond originates from metallic Pd for both catalysts.
As shown in Fig. 2, the peak intensity for the PdO bond gradually decreases for the reduction process. The peak corresponding to the PdPd bond then appears and its intensity increases. The peak for the PdPd bond of LaFePdO3 indicated by arrow corresponds to metallic Pd. The segregated Pd from perovskite crystal does not,therefore, alloy with Fe under these conditions. During the oxidation process, as shown in Fig. 2, the signal for the PdPd bond decreases and disappears, whereas that for the PdO bond appears and increases.
Fig. 3 shows the time dependence of the coordination number (CN) of the PdO bonds and PdPd bond. The theoretical CN of the PdO bond for the perovskite crystal is 6 and that for PdO is 4. In the analysis of the spectra, the DebyeWaller factors were fixed at those values extracted from reference materials (Pd and PdO powder) measured at the same temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a for the reduc- tion process, the CN of the PdO bond decreased from 5.6 to 1.1. The decreasing of the CN of the PdO bond meant that about 20% of the Pd remained dissolved in the perov- skite crystal and about 80% of the Pd was reduced at 400 C. This reduction ratio of Pd in LaFePdO3 at 400 C was almost equal to the values obtained in other analyses [8]. The CN of the generated PdPd bond in LaF- ePdO3 increased instantaneous and kept less than 6.2.

As shown in Fig. 3c, the CN of the PdPd bond in Pd/ Al2O3 was increasing slowly to 8.1 with grain growth of metal Pd.
The observed CN of the PdPd bond of LaFePdO3 was about 6.2 in the reduction process. The observed CN was corrected to allow for the existence ratio of Pd in an oxi- dized or reduced state (Table 2). As a result, the corrected CN of the PdPd bond was 7.7 (=6.2/0.804). This cor- rected CN of the PdPd bond should, theoretically, be 12 for a large particle of metallic Pd with an fcc structure.
The small CN value observed in this case is caused by the size effect for smaller particles.
The average CN decreases as the surface-to-bulk ratio increases, because the CN of surface atoms is smaller than that of atoms in the bulk material. The average coordina- tion number for a cube consisting of fcc unit cells is derived by taking into consideration the surface-to-bulk ratio. If the particle consists of n3 unit cells and the lattice constant a, the edge length of the cube is L = na. The average coor- dination number [N(n)] can be calculated according to the following formula [7]: Nn 24n22n  1 n  14n2  2n  1 The lattice constant (a) of Pd is 0.389 nm. From N(n) = 7.7 and n = 2.1, the average particle size L of Pd particle segregated from LaFePdO3 is therefore roughly estimated to be about 0.8 nm.
On the other hand, the CN of metallic Pd on Al2O3 increased up to 8.1. The CN of PdO was changed to 0.4 from 3.8, showing that about 90% of the PdO was reduced.
The corrected CN of PdPd bond was calculated to be
9.1(=8.1/0.895, n = 3.4). The average Pd particle size on
Al2O3 therefore corresponded to about 1.3 nm.
As shown in Fig. 3b for the oxidation process, the CN of metallic Pd of LaFePdO3 decreased quickly and the CN of the PdO bond of LaFePdO3 recovered to 5.0 instantly. This CN of the PdO of LaFePdO3 meant that about 50% of the Pd was dissolved in the perovskite crystal and about 50% of the Pd was oxidized to PdO at 400 C. As the temperature was raised to 700 C after measurement under oxidizing conditions, the PdO 0 10 20 30 Pd-O Pd-Pd 0 2 40

313 on LaFePdO3 was recovered to the perovskite crystal lattice.
As shown in Fig. 3d, the CN of metallic Pd on Al2O3 decreased slowly and the CN of the PdO bond of Al2O3 also recovered slowly.
The change in the Pd state with redox fluctuations that accompanied its segregation out and solidsolution into the perovskite crystal are extremely fast, taking only about 1 s. These rapid movements of Pd in the perovskite crystal could be the result of the sensitivity of the perovskite crys- tal to oxygen and prevent from the particle growth.
4. Conclusion
The dynamical changes in the Pd structure, which corre- sponds to the movement of the Pd atom in and out of the perovskite crystal, were measured by in situ DXAFS. Pd movements between segregation and solidsolution with the perovskite crystal take only about 1 s at 400 C. It was proved that these Pd movements could respond to the high-speed fluctuations of automotive exhaust. It was also clearly shown that the Pd metal particles segregated from the perovskite crystal are extremely fine, and the Pd particle size is only 0.8 nm.
