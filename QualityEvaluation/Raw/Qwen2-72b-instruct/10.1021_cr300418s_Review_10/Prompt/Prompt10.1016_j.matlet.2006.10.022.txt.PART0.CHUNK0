1. Introduction
In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the synthesis of nanosized crystalline metal oxides because of their large surface areas, unusual adsorptive properties, surface defects and fast diffusivities [1]. The physicochemical property of nanoparticles has intimate connection with the preparation technique. There have been many reports of nanosized metal oxide being successfully prepared using inorganic or organo- metallic precursors in the gas phase, solid state and the liquid phase [25]. The solid-state synthesis procedures are simple and convenient. And the liquid phase synthesis is an attractive way often used in laboratory to prepare high-purity products.
Nickel oxide (NiO) is a very important material extensively used in catalysis, battery cathodes, gas sensors, electrochromic films, and magnetic materials [611]. NiO catalyst exhibits good low temperature catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) to ethylene reaction [12].
In this paper NiO nanoparticles were prepared by some of solid and liquid phase preparation techniques. The difference of physicochemical property between large size NiO and nano- sized NiO prepared by different methods was investigated through SEM, XRD, O2-TPD characterization.
2. Experiments
2.1. Preparation
NiO nanoparticles used in this study were prepared by the following techniques [1316].
2.1.1. Solid-state milling method (NiO-M)
5 g of nickelous acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, AR) and
4.2 g of citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, AR) were mixed and ground
for 2 h at ambient temperature until strong sour was released.
The mixture was calcined at 400 C for 4 h.
2.1.2. Precipitation method (NiO-P)
Nickel oxide was prepared by adding a solution of 5.8 g of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR) in 100 mL of deionized water to an ammonium hydroxide solution (80 mL, 22%).
The pH of the solution was maintained at 10. The mixed solution was stirred by magnetic stirring apparatus at 100 C for 16 h. The resultant gel was filtered, and then washed with deionized water for 810 times. The gel was dried at 75 C overnight, then calcined at 400 C for 4 h.

2.1.3. Solgel method (NiO-SG)
5.8 g of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR) and 4.2 g of
citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, AR) were dissolved completely in 100 mL of deionized water respectively. The nickel nitrate solution was dripped in the citric acid solution. Then the mixed solution was heated to 70 C with mechanical stirring for about 18 h. After the removal of water through evaporation, a translucent green gel was formed. Next, the gel obtained was aged and dried at 110 C for 24 h; subsequently, it was calcined at 400 C for 4 h.
2.1.4. Reverse micro-emulsion method (NiO-ME)
An aqueous solution (10 mL) containing 2.9 g of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR) was prepared. A reverse micro-emulsion (water in organic) was prepared by mixing while stirring this aqueous solution (10 mL) with 90 mL of hexane (AR), Fig. 1.

isobutanol (AR), and surfactant Triton X-100 (AR) with the volume ratio 11:80:15. This emulsion was mixed while stirring with another emulsion having similar characteristics, except that the aqueous solution now contained aqueous ammonia (10 mL,10%). The mixed fluid was stirred for 24 h, after which the resulting suspension was centrifuged and decanted and the remaining solid was washed with ethanol. Then, after centrifug- ing and decanting again, the solid was first dried at 70 C for 24 h, and finally it was calcined in air at 400 C for 4 h.
Large size NiO (denoted by NiO-L) was obtained from the decomposition of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 5.8 g) and calcined at 400 C for 4 h.
2.2. Characterization
The morphologies of NiO particles were observed directly by SEM (LEO-100). The surface areas (BET) of the samples were determined after degassing the samples at 300 C and analyzing the N2 adsorption isotherm at liquid nitrogen temperature (Tristar 3000). Phase identification and structural analysis were performed by X-ray powder diffraction (Model D/Max-C, Rigaku), with CuKα (λ=0.15406 nm) by step scanning (0.02) in the 2θ range of 2090. O2-TPD was conducted on a mass spectrometer (Balzer Omni Star 200). The sample (50 mg) is heated to 600 C in He at a constant rate of 15 C/min.
Catalytic activities were measured at atmospheric pressure in a quartz fixed-bed micro-reactor (i.d.=5 mm). The outlet mixture is analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the morphologies of NiO particles prepared by different methods. The photographs clearly display NiO obtained from the conventional decomposition method is large sized with an average diameter of about 450 nm. But the diameters of NiO particles prepared by other technique are below 100 nm. Therein NiO nanoparticles prepared by solid-state milling method have maldistribution in the range of 2555 nm. The NiO synthesized through the precipitation process are sheet-like and composed by spherical particles in the range of 1430 nm. The SEM images of NiO-SG and NiO-ME nanoparticles show fine spherical particles with uniform size.
Compared with solid-state preparation method, preparation process in the liquid phase is more beneficial to mixing and reaction of raw material and synthesis products with uniform particle size. By precipitation method the precursor usually forms long chains through hydrogen bonds between crystalline water and easily produces agglomeration during calcinations. For modified solgel or micro-emulsion method, however,steric effects caused by the structure of citric acid or droplets serve as micro-reactors where nucleation, crystal growth and nuclei agglomera- tion occur and prevent close approach of individual particles. Fig. 2 exhibited a sharp distribution of the NiO nanoparticles prepared by reverse micro-emulsion method. But we can also observe that there exists Table 1 The physical property of NiO particle prepared by different methods Sample Surface area (m2/g) Particle size a (nm) NiO-L 6 450 b NiO-M 16

some flocculating surfactant undecomposed over the obtained NiO-ME nanoparticles calcined at 400 C.
Fig. 3 displays the X-ray diffraction patterns of NiO nanoparticles prepared by different methods. It can be seen that three distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ=37, 43, 63 are observed for nanosized NiO samples. These peak positions correspond well with the three most intense peaks (1 1 1) (2 0 0) (2 2 0) of pure cubic NiO. As we know, the diffraction peaks are broader and have weaker intensity when the size of particle is decreased to the extent. The FWHM of NiO peaks grew wider from up to down from the XRD patterns. NiO prepared by conventional method has sharp diffraction peaks. The NiO-ME sample has the broadest FWHM, which means the diameters of NiO-ME nanoparticles are the smallest. The particle size of these NiO samples calculated by Scherrer Formula and the specific surface area data are listed in Table 1.
NiO-L has the largest size and smallest surface area, which is in agreement with the XRD result. The specific surface area through liquid phase synthesis is much larger than that through solid-state way. Therein the nanosized NiO-ME has the largest surface area, which is consistent with XRD and SEM results. The average size of NiO nanoparticles calculated by Scherrer Formula (D=0.9λ/βcosθ), however, is a little smaller than the values observed by SEM. The causes may be observations by imaging techniques such as SEM often give the size of the particle, while the X-ray diffraction discloses the crystalline size.
The property of adsorption oxygen was investigated by temperature programmed desorption experiment. The O2-TPD-MS profiles of NiO particles prepared by different methods are shown in Fig. 4. There is only one broad desorption peak that started from 520 C for the large sized NiO at below 600 C. Nevertheless there are two desorption peaks for NiO nanoparticles prepared by different methods. The area of desorption peaks increases when the particles size decreases except the NiO-ME nanoparticles, which is attributed to their large surface area and much surface defect. The smaller the nanoparticles are, the larger the special surface area and the more surface defects there are. Therefore, the amount of adsorption oxygen increases with the enhanced special surface area of NiO nanoparticles. However, due to the fact that the surfactant can't be decomposed completely at 400 C, it has covered the partial surface area of NiO-ME nanoparticles, which restrains the adsorption of oxygen.The catalytic performance of nanosized NiO catalysts is presented in Fig. 5. Ethane conversion increases over these samples with reaction temperature increasing. Over NiO-L catalyst maximal ethylene yield 13% is obtained at 400 C. When the same yield is obtained, the reaction temperatures decrease over NiO-M, NiO-ME, NiO-P and NiO-SG respectively. Thus the activity order is NiO-SG N NiO-P N NiO-ME N NiO-M, which is in full accord with the adsorptive property of NiO nanoparticles. It's obvious that the enhanced special surface area leads to stronger adsorptive property and sequential better ODHE reaction activity.
4. Conclusion
Nanosized NiO material was prepared by different methods.It's obvious that synthesis techniques influence the size, shapes and distribution of NiO nanoparticles. Therein NiO-SG and NiO-ME have larger special surface area and better particle distribution. The special surface area of NiO nanoparticles influences the adsorptive property, which has intimate connec- tion with their catalytic behavior. The undecomposed surfactant covering the partial surface of NiO-ME restrained its adsorp- tion. Thus, NiO-SG nanoparticles have good adsorptive property and best catalytic behavior for ODHE reaction.
