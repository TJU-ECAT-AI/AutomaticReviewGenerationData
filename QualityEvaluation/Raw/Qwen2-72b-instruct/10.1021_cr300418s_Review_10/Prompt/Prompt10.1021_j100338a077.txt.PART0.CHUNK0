I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

J. Phys. Chem. 1989,
93, 401-403 401 ruthenium complex and viologen to the micellar surface, the result being approximately equivalent radical yields whether in the presence or absence of SDS micelles.
However, for R u M C   + / C  V  + and R u M C   + / C   V  + the breakup of the self-association of C,V2+ by the SDS micelles dominates, and the radical yields decrease in the presence of SDS micelles.
The interaction between RuMCS2+ and C,V2+ is not suggested to be intimate enough to allow rapid back-electron-transfer, since significant radical yields are observed. While the structural picture is rather imperfect, it does seem clear that alkyl chains on the electron donor and acceptor generate subtle ultrastructural changes that potentially allow control of the photoinduced electron-transfer efficiency.
Conclusions The results in Figure 1 indicate a net electron transfer between photoexcited tris(bipyridine)ruthenium and methylviologen when bound to SDS micelles at 77 K. Based upon the similarity in ESR spectral properties, the observed signal is attributed to the viologen monocation radical. Noticeably absent from the ESR spectra was any indication of another radical species, which one would expect to arise from the oxidized ruthenium chromophore. Two very distinctive ESR spectra have been previously assigned to the R(bpy),+ radial,'J either of which should have been easily recognized in the samples in the present study. Presumably, this other radical species is not stable in frozen micellar or frozen aqueous solutions.The trends shown for the radical yields observed in the different samples indicate variability in the average separation distance (17) DeSimone, R.

between ruthenium and viologen molecules. One explanation of these trends is that both the ruthenium complex and the viologen molecule become embedded in the SDS micellar interface to varying degrees, depending on their alkyl chain length. This interpretation explains two major features of Figure 4.
First, for the Ru(bpy),2+ samples, the radical yield declines from MV2+ to CzoV2+,. suggesting that the viologen moiety is gradually being inserted more deeply into the micellar interface with increasing alkyl chain length, and thus is further away from the ruthenium chromophore.
Second, an optimal yield is found for the alkylruthenium complexes with c6v2+ and c8v2+.
One expects these complexes to be embedded deeper into the micelle, and optimum proximity to the alkylmethylviologens apparently occurs for hexyl to octyl.
In aqueous solutions without SDS micelles the differences in yields shown in Figure 5 are consistent with a scheme where the alkylmethyl viologens self-associate to form aggregates in frozen solution with larger aggregates for longer alkyl chains. The larger aggregates have a greater tendency to associate with RuMCS2+,but with Ru(bpy)?+, association of the larger aggregates is modified by charge effects. In the presence of SDS micelles the C,V2+ aggregates are broken up and the radical yields are affected accordingly.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
