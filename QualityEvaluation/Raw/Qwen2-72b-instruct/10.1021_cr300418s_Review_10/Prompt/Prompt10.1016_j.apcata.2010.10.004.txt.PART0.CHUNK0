An optimum ethane conversion of 33% with 78% of selectivity to ethylene was obtained for a NiNbO catalyst containing 15% of Nb at 350 C with a weight to flow W/F ratio of 0.54 g s mL1. The catalysts have been characterized using various techniques allowing to show that the efficiency of the catalysts was related to a surface interaction between the NiO active phase and an amorphous Nb2O5 phase. Because ammonium oxalato niobate was used as niobium precursor, oxalate ions were present; concomitantly to the surface interaction described, the thermal decomposition of these oxalate ions induced a reduction in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry which also influences the catalytic properties. It was demonstrated that only a small percent of Nb was necessary to have these effects and the optimal activity observed for 15% of Nb had to be related to another process which corresponds to the decrease in the active phase particle size induced by the amorphous Nb2O5 phase; this phase prevents the sintering of the active phase particles during the thermal transformation of the catalysts precursors.
It was also shown that the thermal decomposition of oxalates limits NiO crystal growth. Above 15% of Nb the amorphous phase reacted with the nickel oxide to form an inactive mixed niobium and nickel oxide phase NiNb2O6. The study of the catalytic properties over long periods of time showed that the NiNbO catalysts underwent a slow but systematic deactivation. This deactivation has been attributed both to the continuous reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in the reaction conditions and to the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase thermodynamically stable at the catalytic reaction temperature.

1. Introduction
The demand of ethylene and propylene as starting materials for the production of chemicals has never been so high and there is a need to develop alternative routes to produce them. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes would be one of the most promising routes if catalysts efficient enough to make the process commercially attractive were found.
The two catalytic systems giving outstanding performance far beyond most of the proposed ones are those based either on NiO oxide [18], or mixed molybdates [913]. Other catalysts such as LiDyMgO and LaSrCuClO [14,15] also led to high yields but contrarily to the two former systems which have optimum prop- erties around 400 C, these catalysts are efficient above 630 C. At these temperatures, dehydrogenation occurs partially in the gas phase and is likely not oxidative.
Compared to mixed molybdates whose composition and syn- thesis pathways are quite complex, NiO based catalysts appeared Corresponding author: Tel.: +33 4 72 44 53 17; fax: +33 4 72 44 53 99.

They correspond to bulk NiNbO mixed oxides with an optimal Nb/Ni ratio around 0.18 resulting in an overall ethylene yield of 46% at 400 C [2]. The materials have been characterized and it has been proposed that the active phase corresponds to a Ni1xNbxO solid solution with 0 < x < 0.18 and Nb cations substituting either Ni cations and/or filling the cationic vacancies in the defective non- stoichiometric structure [2,3].First CH bond breaking in light alkanes is a difficult reaction that cannot be performed by nucleophilic oxygen species. Oxidative species like Oare needed. The involvement for light alkanes acti- vation of Ospecies at the surface of p-type semi-conductors has already been suggested from thermodynamic considerations and discussed in various case examples [1719]. NiO alike some light alkanes oxidation catalysts is a p-type semiconducting oxide with positive holes p+ as main charge carriers. These holes are correlated to the redox couple Ni3+/Ni2+ through the permanent equilibrium: Ni3+ Ni2+ + p+ (1) 0926-860X/$  see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

149 These holes correspond to electron vacancies in the valence band of O2and may be represented in terms of chemical sites by O according to the reaction: O2+ p+ O (2) Such electrophilic species have been shown to be able to cleave the first CH bond of a light alkane molecule leading to a radical from whom a second hydrogen can rapidly be abstracted [18,19]:

(4) NiO presents a high surface content of Othat makes it a very active but unselective catalyst to oxidize ethane. It is thus important to reduce their concentration at the surface of the active phase in order to limit this total oxidation. Lemonidou and coworker have pro- posed that the substitution of Ni by Nb cations in NiNbO catalysts reduced the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry and consequently the electrophilic Ospecies concentration [2]. The catalytic efficiency of these compounds in ethane ODH would thus be related to the presence at the surface of NiO of dispersed Ospecies in amount high enough to convert sufficiently ethane but low enough to avoid total oxidation. Other recent studies in the literature seem to show that substitution with other cations such as Ti could similarly induce enhancement of catalytic activity in light alkane oxidative dehydrogenation over NiO based oxides [20].
The present study has been undertaken to explore the potential of these catalysts and to better understand the role of structural features of these new NiNbO catalysts. NiNbO mixed oxides with various Nb/NiO ratios have been prepared, tested and charac- terized by different methods including X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman and XPS spectroscopy. To understand the effect of oxalates, pure NiO prepared with various amounts of oxalic acid were studied. The role of niobium was investigated comparing pure NiO to niobium oxide supported on NiO. Finally the stability with time on stream of all these catalysts, which had not yet been exten- sively studied, has specifically been addressed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
NiNbO catalysts have been prepared using a method described in the literature [4]. Nickel nitrate hexa-hydrated and ammonium niobium oxalate were dissolved in hot water. The solu- tion was maintained for 1 h at 70 C under stirring and reflux before being evaporated under reduced pressure at the same tempera- ture. The solid obtained were dried at 120 C and calcined under air flow at 450 C for 5 h. Catalysts with different atomic compositions Ni1xNbxO with x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.13, 0.15, 0.19,have been synthesized and will be referred to as these compositions (Ni0.85Nb0.15).
In parallel pure NiO and NbOx supported on NiO catalysts have been synthesized. Pure NiO catalysts have been prepared using two methods. The first one corresponded to the thermal decomposition of nickel nitrate at 450 C in air for 5 h. The second one corresponded to the method described for the synthesis of NiNbO catalysts but substituting the niobium precursor by oxalic acid. Different amount of oxalic acid corresponding to Ni/H2C2O4 ratios of 1, 2 and 3, have been added in order to study the specific influence of oxalic acid. It is important to recall that niobium is added in the NiNbO catalyst preparation as a mixed ammonium niobium oxalate (NH4)NbO(C2O4)2.H2O and that oxalate anions are thus present in the reaction medium. The NiO catalysts will be referred to as NiO, NiO-OA-1/1, NiO-OA-2/1 and NiO-OA-3/1.
A catalyst corresponding to niobium oxide supported on NiO (Nb/NiO) has been prepared by impregnation of the NiO-OA-2/1 catalyst with a solution of mixed ammonium niobium oxalate. The amount of niobium supported was of 0.7 weight %, which corre- sponded approximately to one tenth of theoretical monolayer. The suspension was maintained 1 h under stirring at room temperature and the water was then evaporated at 70 C. The solid obtained was dried and calcined under air at 450 C for 5 h.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Metal contents of the solids were determined by atomic absorp- tion (ICP) and their specific surface areas determined using the BET method with nitrogen adsorption. Theoretical specific surface area of the NiO phase has been calculated from the particle sizes estimated from XRD data using the Scherrer formula:
D
0.9
(2)FWHM cos (5) where D is the domain size, and  is the angle of the Bragg peak (FWHM: full width at half max). The formula was applied to peaks of (1,0,1), (0,1,2), (1,1,3) and (0,2,4) crystal planes. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a BRUKER D5005 diffractometer with Cu K radiation ( = 1.54184 A) with 0.02(2) steps over 1080angular range and 1 s counting time per step. The unit cell of the phases was refined using BRUKER TOPAS P program.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was done using a JEOL 2010 equipment operating at 200 kV with a high resolution pole piece and an energy-dispersive X-ray spec- trometer (EDX; Link Isis, Oxford Instruments). The samples were dispersed in ethanol using a sonicator. A drop of the suspension was dripped onto a carbon film supported on a copper grid; EDX studies were carried out using a 15 nm probe to analyze the particles.
Raman spectra were recorded before and after catalytic testing using a LabRam HR spectrometer (Jobin Yvon-Horiba). The exciting line at 514.53 nm of an Ar-Kr 2018 RM laser (Spectra Physics) was focused on several points of the samples with a long working X50 objective. The laser power on samples was limited to ca 100 W.
Raman mappings were recorded using a motorized stage to analyze the samples homogeneity at the micron scale.
Surface analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed in a KRATOS Axis Ultra DLD equipped with a mag- netic immersion lens, a hemispherical analyzer and a delay line detector. Experiments were performed using a monochromated Al K X-ray source with a pressure in the analysis chamber below 5 × 108 Pa. XPS spectra of Ni 2p, Nb 3d, O1s and C1s levels were measured at 90(normal angle with respect to the plane of the sur- face). A charge neutralizer was used to control charges effects on samples.
Oxygen thermo-desorption (O2-TPD-MS) experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure in the testing apparatus.
0.5 g of sample was used and pretreated under O2 atmosphere
(30 mL/min) at 450 C for 30 min and cooled down to ambient temperature, then heated under N2 (rate 15 C min1) to 800 C.
Oxygen desorption was recorded on-line using a VG PROLAB mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corporation). Temperature reduc- tion experiments (TPR) have been conducted in the same way as the O2-TPD-MS ones. The samples were reduced using a flow of 5% of H2 in N2 (30 mL min1, 10 C min1) up to 550 C.
2.3. Catalysts testing
The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was per- formed in a fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure.
The experiments were conducted between 300 and 400 C with a catalyst amount varying from 0.1 to 1 g. The feedstock com- 150

O2:C2H6:N2 = 9:9:82 [1]. The weight to flow ratio (W/F) used was
equal to 0.54 g s mL1. Ethane and the reaction products were ana- lyzed on-line by gas chromatography with a TCD detector. Ethane,ethylene and CO2 were separated on a Hayesep T column and O2, N2, and CO, on a molecular sieve column. The calculated carbon balances were always very close to 100%. To check for the absence of formation of oxygenates, the reaction products were condensed in an ice-cooled trap and analyzed off-line using a chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a Nukol column.
3. Results
3.1. Study of NiNbO catalysts
The results of the chemical analyses and of the specific surface area measurements are presented in Table 1. They showed that compounds with the desired stoichiometry have been obtained and that the specific surface area increased with the Nb content up to 15% and then decreased. XRD patterns of mixed oxides showed only one phase corresponding to NiO (Fig. 1). It was not possible to attribute the patterns to Fm3m cubic (ICDD File: 004-083) or R3c rhombohedric (ICDD 044-1159) structure because of bands widths.
As substitution increased a broad background showing the pres- ence of an amorphous phase was detected. At Nb content higher than 15% a mixed oxide NiNb2O6 was identified. The pseudo cubic cell parameters of the NiO phase are gathered in Table 1 with the particle sizes calculated from XRD data. No significant change in 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 Relative intensity (a.u.)

Peaks corresponding to the NiNb2O6 phase are indexed with black points. cell parameters was detected, but a decrease in particle size was clearly evidenced increasing Nb content. Fig. 2 shows that at low and high Nb contents the NiO theoretical specific surface area cal- culated from the particle size was higher than the measured one.
This result was explained by a strong agglomeration of the parti- cles at low Nb content and by the formation of the mixed oxide NiNb2O6 at high Nb content. The presence of the amorphous phase was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and EDX anal- yses allowed to attribute this phase to amorphous Nb2O5. The EDX analyses performed on more than 30 NiO particles of the 15% sam- ple did not confirm the formation of a solid solution of Nb in NiO.Two types of particles were evidenced: relatively large ones (up to 20 nm), which were more or less agglomerated and small ones (23 nm), which appeared as embedded into the amorphous Nb2O5 phase (Fig. 3a). Because of that, it was impossible to have EDX analyses specific to the smallest particles. However the analyses of the larger ones consistently showed Nb content close to only 1% (Nb/(Ni + Nb) = 0.01  0.003). The latter particles appeared well crystallized and without any surface amorphization (Fig. 3b).
The samples have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4). The spectra showed main bands at 462 and 505 cm1 and second order broad bands at 710, 930 and 1090 cm1. The first two bands have been respectively attributed to transverse and longitudinal optic vibration modes related to a rhombohedric deformation of the structure or to non-stoichiometric NiO stretching vibrations and the others to overtones of the first ones or their combinations [21,22].
Small bands at 1480 and 1060 cm1 have also been observed;they were respectively attributed to the combination of two magnons (2 M mode) [22] and to 1 vibration mode of carbonate groups, whose presence at the surface of the catalysts has been confirmed by infra-red and XPS spectroscopy. For compounds with substitution higher than 7%, an additional band at 840 cm1 was observed and attributed to stretching vibrations of slightly dis- torted NbO6 octahedra in amorphous Nb2O5 (Fig. 4). Raman images plotting the spatial distribution of the relative intensity of this band evidenced a high homogeneity at the micron scale up to 3% of Nb Fig. 2.

The quantitative results of the XPS analyses are summarized in Table 2. They showed that the surface Nb/(Ni + Nb) atomic ratios of the catalysts were close to those of the bulk ones and no changes were observed after the catalytic treatment. The O1s sig- nals were complex with several peaks between 529 and 533 eV (Fig. 5). They have been fitted with 4 bands. The two main bands at

by the observation of a C1s band at 288.2 eV) and the fourth one at 531.9532.2 eV ascribed to Ospecies [2325]. The two lat- ter bands, which are present in the spectrum of pure NiO, have a low intensity and the spectral resolution obtained did not allow ascertaining any relative intensity for these bands and to further interpret the XPS data. It is specially the case for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 sample after deactivation which spectrum showed only small dis- placements in binding energies due to charging effects and small change in relative intensity compared to before.
The Ni 2p signal showed one large peak around 856.0 eV with a shoulder at 1.5 eV higher energy, that have respectively been ascribed to Ni+2 and Ni+3 species [23,24,26]. It should be mentioned that controversies remain about the attribution of the shoulder.
Sawatzky and coworker [27] suggested that this second peak is the result of a screening process by an electron that does not come from the oxygen atoms directly around the ionized Ni atom, but from neighboring NiO6 units. Since the attribution of the second peak is uncertain, the results have not been taken into account in the conclusions drawn on the evolution of the Ni3+ content of the catalysts. Furthermore the evolutions observed are very weak and may be considered as insignificant.
The thermo-desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD-MS) has been used to characterize the surface of several catalysts. Four adsorbed oxygen species on transition metal oxide like NiO have been described in the literature [28]. These species, which desorbed at increasing temperature, correspond to O2 ( around 30 C), O2( 320360 C) and O( 420450 C and  above 520 C).  and species have been assigned to Oadsorbed on different sites [28].
The desorption curves obtained are presented in Fig. 6a and the volume of O2 desorbed expressed per surface square meters of cat- alysts as a function of Nb/(Nb + Ni) ratio in Fig. 6b. On the pure NiO and lower Nb content catalysts, the three species ,  and  were observed whereas only the  and  species were detected on the compounds richer in Nb. Both desorption temperatures and quanti- ties of desorbed oxygen varied with the Nb content. The desorption temperature for the  species increased whereas the temperature for the  ones decreased. In parallel the volume of adsorbed oxygen strongly decreased with increasing Nb content. The results show that the presence of niobium had more impact on the  species since the relative ratio between  and  species strongly decreased.
It should be recalled that a decrease in particles size was also taking place that may have an effect on the adsorption properties of the solids.
TPR profiles of Ni0.93Nb0.07 and Ni0.985Nb0.015 samples are shown in Fig. 7a and compared to that of a pure NiO phase prepared the same way. The reduction of the catalysts containing niobium started at approximately the same temperature (320 C). All the reduction processes proceeded with almost the same rate up to 550 C. These results were in good agreement with those previously published on similar catalysts [2].
The catalytic properties of the NiNbO catalysts are presented in Table 3. In all cases, oxygen conversion did not exceed 85%. The results obtained confirmed those published in the literature [2]. The presence of even small amounts of Nb caused a drastic increase in conversion compared to pure nickel oxide. Increasing the Nb content in the mixed oxides leads to increased ethane conversion,which reached a maximum for the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst and then decreased similarly to what was previously observed[2]. The intrin- sic rate and the apparent activation energy of ethane conversion decreased continuously when the Nb content increased up to a Nb content between 3 and 7% and then remained almost constant. In the same time the selectivity to ethylene increased to also reach a plateau for the same Nb content. The stability of the selectivity to ethylene when the conversion was varied between 6 and 25% has been studied on the Ni0.93Nb0.07 and Ni0.97Nb0.03 catalysts at 350 C. The conversion was changed varying the flow rate from 30 Fig. 6.

16 44 ing to niobium oxide supported on NiO always showed a single phase corresponding to NiO except the NiO-OA-1/1, which showed peaks of Ni0 and was not further investigated. The pseudo-cubic cell parameters of the pure NiO phase are gathered in Table 4 with the calculated particle sizes and the specific surface area measure- ments. The results showed that the addition of oxalic acid had a strong effect on the NiO particle sizes, which decreased and that such effect was obtained with only a limited amount of oxalic acid since the NiO-OA-2/1 and 3/1 samples have comparable proper- ties. The deposition of niobium oxide did not modify the structure and texture of the supporting NiO oxide.
The catalytic properties of the compounds are compared at 330 C in Table 5. We observed a large increase in conversion with the addition of oxalic acid during the solid preparation and in paral- lel the selectivity to ethylene increased. When comparing NiO and NiO-OA-3/1, the increase in conversion observed can be related to the increase in specific surface area since the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. NiO-OA-3/1 was slightly less active than NiO-OA-2/1 and upon addition of niobium the con- version and the rate strongly decreased but the selectivity further increased to reach 78%. Similarly to NiNbO catalysts, the selectiv- ity to ethylene appeared stable when the conversion was increased up to 33% at 350 C.
The samples have been characterized by O2-TPD-MS and again the three ,  and  species can be observed although the two latter appeared as the major ones (Fig. 8). The NiO-OA-2/1 O2-TPD-MS profile was similar to that of Ni0.85Nb0.15O. The further addition of Nb had several effects; the  species were not observed and the temperature of desorption of the  and  species increased and decreased respectively. In the same time, the amount of adsorbed O2 on the two species strongly decreased from 7 to 4.102 mL g1.
TPR analyses conducted on the NiO-OA-2/1 and Nb/NiO samples showed that the addition of Nb oxide at the surface of NiO increased the reduction temperature of almost 50 C (Fig. 7b).
3.3. Study of catalysts deactivation
The stability of the catalytic properties as a function of time has been studied in one hand on the Ni0.93Nb0.07O and Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalysts and in the other one, on the NiO-OA-3/1 and Nb/NiO com- pounds. The variations of the conversion, selectivity to ethylene and yield in ethylene over time at 380 C are presented for each catalyst type in Fig. 9. With time on stream, a continuous deactiva- tion of the NiNbO catalyst was observed except for Ni0.85Nb0.15O,which underwent a more rapid deactivation during the first 20 h Table 5 Ethane conversion, selectivity and yield in ethylene on the different NiO and Nb/NiO compounds (reaction conditions: T = 330 C, C2H6/O2/N2 = 9/9/82, W/F = 0.54 g mL1 s1, time on stream: 4 h). The calculated apparent activation energy (Ea) and the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion (C2H6 ) are also presented.

In the same time the selectivity slightly decreased for pure NiO and Ni0.93Nb0.07O and remained almost constant for Ni0.85Nb0.15O. For the Nb/NiO compound a rapid deactivation was observed after only 100 h of testing with an increase in selectivity.
After more than 290 h the catalysts have been submitted in the cat- alytic reactor to a heat treatment at 450 C under O2 for 30 min and brought back in the reaction conditions. No change in the catalytic properties was observed and the catalysts continued to deactivate.
In the case of the pure NiO phase it seemed that the deactivation was even accelerated.
In order to understand the origin of the deactivation, the solids have been characterized using various techniques. The X- ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts remained unchanged after deactivation except for Ni0.93Nb0.07O for which small peaks corre- sponding to NiNb2O6 were observed (Fig. 10). The specific surface areas of the catalysts decreased after deactivation. However the decreases were rather limited and could not explain the deac- tivation process. For example, the specific surface area of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O catalyst went from 81 m2 g1 before deactivation to 74 m2 g1 after.
The Raman spectra of the solids after deactivation testing are gathered in Fig. 11. In the spectra of the NiO-OA-3/1 and Nb/NiO cat- alysts a significant decrease in the relative intensity of the first order bands at 462 and 505 cm1 compared to the second order band at 1090 cm1 was observed. It has been previously shown that the relative intensity of these bands that is not null for stoichiometric 325 300 275 250 225 200 175 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 a Selectivity to ethylene Conversion of ethane % Time, h 175 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 b Selectivity to ethylene Conversion of ethane % Time, h 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 c treatment at 450C for 30min under O2 flow % Time, h Selectivity to ethylene Conversion of ethane 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 d Selectivity to ethylene Conversion of ethane % Time, h Fig. 9.

NiO increases with the non-stoichiometry value of NiO(1+x) [29,30].
Therefore, the damping phenomenon observed after deactivation can be related to strong decrease in the Ni3+ content of the solids and thus to strong reduction of the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry in agreement with the green color of the two samples after reac- tion. A similar decrease in relative intensity has been observed for the bands in the spectra of Ni0.85Nb0.15O after deactivation but was much less marked.
XPS analyses of several catalysts have been made after deactiva- tion and compared to those obtained before. No significant change in Nb/(Ni + Nb) was observed (Table 5). O2-TPD-MS experiments performed on the Nb/NiO catalyst before and after deactivation showed that the  and  species observed before testing between 500 and 650 C have disappeared after deactivation and only new oxygen species were observed with desorption temperature around 700 C (Fig. 8). No assignment has presently been proposed for these species. The TPR experiments conducted on the same solids showed that the reduction of the compound was delayed on the deactivated sample (Fig. 7c).
4. Discussion
The results of the catalytic testing of the NiNbO catalysts are in good agreement with those published in the literature and similar ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were observed for the catalysts with similar composition tested in the same conditions [24]. The results clearly showed that Nb has two main effects at low and high content.
At low Nb content, up to 37%, the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decrease continuously,which is in agreement with a modification of the active sites both in nature and number. The catalytic sites appear more active but less numerous and the rate of ethane conversion thus decrease. In par- allel the selectivity to ethylene strongly increases. No indication of formation of solid solution between NiO and Nb2O5 was obtained from XRD and TEM results and although its existence cannot be completely ruled out, the latter should be very limited and certainly lower than 1% of Nb. We propose that a part of Nb was spread at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible Ospecies. The decrease in the number of the latter species, which are strong oxidizing electrophilic oxygen species able to activate CH bond of ethane at moderate temperature leads to high selec- tivity to ethylene. Such hypothesis formulated by Lemonidou and coworker fits well with the results obtained [2].
At higher Nb content, the apparent activation energy, selectiv- ity to ethylene and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remained almost constant. The active sites are not modified anymore and since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase,the conversion of ethane increases. The best yields are consequently observed for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the phase inactive NiNb2O6 phase is formed and the relative content in active phase starts to decrease. Although it has not been detected in the fresh catalysts, the NiNb2O6 phase may start to be formed at lower Nb content but leads to a limited effect up to 19%.
The increase in the specific surface area that leads to the optimal ethylene yield for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound may be explained by an effect already reported in the literature and called mutual protective effect [31]. It is known that in a biphasic oxide phase mixture the presence of an oxide may prevent the crystallization or/and growth of particles of the other and that such effect may be operative as soon as 5% of one phase is added to the other. The amor- phous Nb2O5 phase plays that role for the active NiO phase. Similar effect have been reported earlier for other binary oxide systems and used to explain catalytic performances enhancements [32,33].
Although this effect is not fully understood, it has been proposed 156
B. Savova et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 390 (2010) 148157
that it could take place already upon co-precipitation when mixed oxalates were formed. The catalytic data clearly showed that this effect will promote the conversion since the specific surface area of the active phase will be larger but does not affect the nature of the catalytic sites neither their concentration, both the apparent activation energy and intrinsic rate of ethane conversion remaining constant.
The results obtained on NiO-OA catalysts show that oxalic acid introduced in the preparation medium has an effect on the tex- ture of the NiO oxide with a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the specific surface area of the solids. In the same time,the decomposition of oxalic acid reduced the nickel oxide. When a molecule of oxalic acid is decomposed 2eare liberated that may reduce nickel, Ni3+ cations first and then Ni2+: H2C2O4 2CO2 + 2H+ + 2e (6) The oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO is thus decreased in NiO- OA-3/1 and NiO-OA-2/1 and when the amount of oxalic acid is high (NiO-OA-1/1) a reduction of the Ni2+ cations to Ni0 is observed.
Table 5 shows that the presence of oxalic acid increases the selec- tivity to ethylene. The conversion first increased for NiO-OA-3/1 and then slightly decreased for NiO-OA-2/1. The first effect can be mainly ascribed to the increase in specific surface area as shown by the rather close intrinsic rates of conversion calculated but not the second since the difference in specific surface area between NiO-OA-3/1 and NiO-OA-2/1 is small. Furthermore the decrease in rate of ethane conversion is high. This decrease can only be explained by a reduction at least at the surface of the NiO oxy- gen over-stoichiometry i.e. of the relative concentration of Ni3+ and consequently of the amount of O. The decrease in the number of the latter species leads to higher selectivity to ethylene.
When niobium oxide is supported on NiO-OA-2/1 (Nb/NiO), the texture of the solid is not affected but the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreased and concomitantly the selectivity to ethylene strongly increased reaching the best value that has been obtained on NiNbO catalysts. This clearly showed that Nb has an effect on the surface of NiO where it decreases the number of active sites by covering them. Upon reduction by the oxalic acid added during the synthesis of NiO-OA-2/1 and further addition of Nb, the appar- ent activation energy decreases while the intrinsic rate of ethane conversion decreases. This can be explained by a decrease in the number of active sites at the surface of the NiO phase that becomes in the same time more active. The same trend was observed on the NiNbO catalysts. It is however not possible to ascertain if Nb could have a specific catalytic role by itself besides contributing to the reduction of the number of active sites and their site isolation [34].
The O2-TPD-MS experiments data may contribute to understand the nature of the active surface species. At the catalytic reaction temperature and higher three main adsorbed species have been identified, ,  and  species and assigned to O2for the first one and Oadsorbed on different surface sites for the two latter. As the strength of the adsorption bonding increases with the desorption temperature,  oxygen should be more labile than  oxygen. Both upon oxalic acid and niobium additions, the  species, which were the minor in quantity, disappeared and the number  and  species strongly decreased.  species are known to be active for total oxida- tion and their disappearing is positive for the selectivity although certainly not determinant. In the same time, the temperature of desorption of  species, increases and that of  decreases. It may be proposed that the selective oxygen species are of  type since contrarily to the  species, these species become more labile when less numerous. This could also explain the decrease in apparent activation energy observed. Interestingly almost only these species are observed on the Nb/NiO, which is the most selective catalyst.
After deactivation only new oxygen species were observed on the Nb/NiO compound; these high temperature species should not be involved in the reaction and correspond presumably to species strongly adsorbed on surface defects (dislocations, edges and cor- ners) which number may increase after surface transformations related to the deactivation.
TPR data are more complex to analyze. In the NiNbO cata- lysts the slight spreading of Nb at the surface of NiO phase, which was the same for all the catalysts and appends as soon as Nb was added, simply lowered the number of Ospecies rendering them more reactive as shown from the catalytic data. This isolation of Owas the same for all the NiNbO catalysts and would simi- larly be obtained with pure NiO prepared with large amount oxalic acid (NiO-OA-2/1). This explained why the reduction temperatures were the same for all the catalysts (Fig. 7a). However, when large amount of niobium was deposited at the surface of NiO (Nb/NiO sample), niobium oxide was covering the surface preventing NiO from reduction and thus increasing the reduction temperature of the solid (Fig. 7b).
The stability of the NiNbO catalysts had been studied by Lemonidou and coworker for 24 h on stream at 350 C [2]. Because it constituted a crucial parameter for a possible industrial develop- ment of these catalysts, we have pursued this study by testing the catalysts over a much longer period of time and at a temperature where the catalysts may present conversions with potential inter- est namely 380 C. First it has been observed that all the catalysts studied were undergoing a deactivation after more or less time.
To begin with, NiNbO catalysts will be considered. The deacti- vation of these catalysts is rather low and is apparently not coupled with a decrease in selectivity although it could exist but to a small extent and be compensated by an increase related to the decrease in conversion. This deactivation is not related to a decrease in specific surface area neither to the formation of coke at the surface. It may be ascribed to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6, which can be evidenced in some catalysts after catalytic testing by X-ray diffrac- tion. Furthermore TPR experiments performed on the Ni0.93Nb0.07 after deactivation showed an increase of about 50 C of the reduc- tion temperature that can be explained by the formation of this phase at the surface of NiO by reaction between Nb2O5 and NiO.
The deactivation can also be explained by a decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase. We have seen that the addition of niobium or oxalic acid allowed to decrease the surface Ocontent and to isolate Othat become active and selective sites for ODH of ethane. When the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry of NiO was decreased to the state where all the surface Ospecies are isolated, a further decrease did not change the nature of the sites but simply decreased their number implying a decrease in activity without change in selectivity. This is what is observed over time on stream.
The deactivation process, which can be evidenced by Raman spectroscopy, was difficult to observe on the NiNbO catalysts since the deactivation after testing was moderate and the change in the spectra are within the experimental precision. However the decrease in NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry was clearly evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the Nb/NiO and NiO-OA-3/1 compounds that suffered from stronger deactivation. The deactivation process may be explain by the fact that contrarily to what could be expected from O2 which tend to accept electrons, its adsorption at a surface with an excess of oxygen i.e. with O, is favored because the extrac- tion work from such surface is favored [32,35]. Inversely when the surface oxygen over-stoichiometry decreases, the O2 adsorption is slowed down as well as the re-oxidation and the deactivation process is auto-catalyzed. Contrary to NiNbO catalysts, the for- mation of the NiNb2O6 phase was not observed on the Nb/NiO catalyst deactivated. However niobium was highly dispersed on the surface of Nb/NiO and the phase could either not be formed or not be detected with the characterization techniques used. It is

157 thus not obvious to determine the relative part taken by the two processes i.e. the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 and the decrease in the oxygen over-stoichiometry of the active NiO phase, in the catalysts deactivation. It is furthermore probable that the two pro- cesses could be linked to each other as the mobility of the surface species necessary to the formation of the phase NiNb2O6 should depend on the surface oxygen stoichiometry.
What is important to note is that it appears difficult to avoid the formation of NiNb2O6 since it is the thermodynamic stable phase at 380 C and that a treatment under oxygen at 450 C do not allow to re-establish the oxygen over-stoichiometry. A treatment at higher temperature may be envisaged but the solid will certainly lose its high specific surface area, which would be detrimental to ethane conversion over the solid. Running the catalytic reaction at lower temperature could also delay the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase,but this would also be detrimental to the catalytic efficiency. Finally,a significant increase in the O2/C2H4 ratio of the gas feed to avoid the decrease in the NiO oxygen over-stoichiometry is not possible since the domain of inflammability would be reached.
5. Conclusions
The most important conclusions are the following:(1) The catalytic results obtained by Lemonidou et al. have been confirmed. NiNbO catalysts are efficient catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Upon addition of niobium oxide,the NiO oxide phase, which is active for ethane oxidation but mainly selective to CO2, loses partially its activity but gains a high selectivity to ethylene.
(2) The addition of niobium has two main effects, which are predominant depending upon the Nb loading. At low load- ing, niobium oxide spreads at the surface of the NiO phase where it reduces the amount of accessible O. The remain- ing more isolated Ospecies which are active sites turned to be highly selective for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
At loading higher than 37% the active sites are not modified anymore since a maximum of interaction between the two oxides is obtained but since the specific surface area of the catalysts continues to increase, the total conversion of ethane increases. The increase in specific surface area is explained by a mutual protective effect between NiO and Nb2O5 that pre- vents the crystallization and/or growth of particles of NiO. This effect allows obtaining the best yields for the Ni0.85Nb0.15O compound. Above 15% of Nb, the inactive phase NiNb2O6 is formed and the catalytic properties are not optimal anymore.
The results obtained show that surface interaction with nio- bium oxide is not the only way to lower the Oconcentration at the surface of NiO but partial reduction with oxalic acid thermally decomposed during preparation, has also to be con- sidered.
(3) The stability on stream of the catalysts has been studied. A con- tinuous monotonous decrease in the activity of all the catalysts was observed over various periods of time. These deactivations over time on stream have been explained by the formation of the NiNb2O6 phase and the reduction of the oxygen over- stoichiometry of NiO to a point where no more Oactive species were present at the surface of NiO. A treatment in air at 450 C for 30 min did not allow to regenerate the catalysts. Neither a treatment at higher temperature nor a treatment for a longer time at lower temperature, have been considered. The first one would lead to a decrease in the specific surface area of the cat- alysts and consequently a decrease in the catalytic activity and the latter has been shown to lead to the formation of the inac- tive NiNb2O6 phase. The way to delay the process could be to decrease the reaction temperature but the catalysts would not be so efficient and of minor interest. A way to avoid the deac- tivation has thus still to be discovered in order to use these efficient catalysts for industrial applications.
