1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties, surface area, and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of niobium in the NiO catalysts limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits the reducibility of NiO, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The geometric effect of the niobium-rich phase covering part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. However, the challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations arise from the complex interactions between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, which can lead to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings.

1.铌氧化物的多样性质,包括其各种稳定形式和氧化态,通过影响催化剂的氧化还原性质、表面积和选择性,影响其在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌在NiO催化剂中的存在限制了NiO晶粒的大小,抑制了NiO的还原性,导致了对乙烷氧化脱氢反应活性较低但选择性较高的催化剂。铌富集相的几何效应,即覆盖NiO的部分非选择性、非化学计量的活性氧物种,得到了高分辨率透射电子显微镜观察的支持。然而,在高Nb负载下,理论预测与实验观察之间的协调挑战源于NiO与薄Nb富集混合氧化层之间的复杂相互作用,这可能导致催化剂显著失活。
