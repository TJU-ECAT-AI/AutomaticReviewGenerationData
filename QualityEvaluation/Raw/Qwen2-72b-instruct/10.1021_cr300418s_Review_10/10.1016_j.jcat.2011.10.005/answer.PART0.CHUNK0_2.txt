[1] "Unlike bulk nickel oxides, the activity of these nanooxides for low-temperature ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been related to their redox properties. In addition to limiting the size of NiO crystallites, the presence of the Nb-rich phase also inhibits NiO reducibility. At Nb content >5 at.%, NbNiO composites are thus less active for ethane ODH but more selective, indicating that the Nb-rich phase probably covers part of the unselective, non-stoichiometric, active oxygen species of NiO."
[2] "The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings."
[3] "Hence, the most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability."
[4] "The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst."

1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the redox properties of the nanooxides. The presence of the Nb-rich phase limits the size of NiO crystallites and inhibits NiO reducibility, leading to less active but more selective catalysts for ethane ODH at Nb content >5 at.%. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, can cause significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by the method are those containing 34 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability. The impact of the preparation method on the structural and catalytic properties of NbNiO nanocomposites suggests that further improvement in NiO-catalyzed ethane ODH can be expected upon optimization of the catalyst. However, challenges arise in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems due to the intricate interplay between the properties of niobium oxides and the behavior of the catalysts.

1.铌氧化物的多种性质，包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态，通过影响纳米氧化物的氧化还原性质，影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂的行为。Nb富集相的存在限制了NiO晶粒的大小，抑制了NiO的还原性，导致在Nb含量>5 at.%时，催化剂对乙烷ODH的活性降低，但选择性提高。NiO与薄Nb富集混合氧化层之间的紧密相互作用，加上在ODH条件下可能的纳米复合材料重构，会在高Nb负载下导致显著的催化剂失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的ODH催化剂是那些含有34 at.% Nb的催化剂，它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。制备方法对NbNiO纳米复合材料的结构和催化性能的影响表明，通过优化催化剂，可以预期NiO催化乙烷ODH的进一步改进。然而，在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，由于铌氧化物的性质与催化剂行为之间的复杂相互作用，将理论预测与实验观察相协调存在挑战。
