1.The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. Niobium reduces the number of active sites for oxygen dissociation by filling the cationic vacancies, which enhances the diffusion of unselective, electrophilic O oxygen species inside the bulk and increases the number of less labile, selective, nucleophilic O2 oxygen species on the catalyst surface. However, the occurrence of structural doping is limited to a few percent of Nb, and the superiority of the Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225 catalyst is due to the presence of an amorphous Nb-rich oxide phase covering part of NiO crystallites surface and thus part of the active, non-selective sites. The close interaction between NiO and the thin Nb-rich mixed oxide layer, combined with possible restructuration of the nanocomposite under ODH conditions, leads to significant catalyst deactivation at high Nb loadings. The most efficient ODH catalysts obtained by this method are those containing 3-4 at.% Nb, which combine high activity, selectivity, and stability.

1.铌氧化物的多样性质，包括其各种稳定形式和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。铌通过填充阳离子空位减少了氧气解离的活性位点数量，这增强了非选择性、亲电O氧物种在体相中的扩散，并增加了催化剂表面较少可移动、更选择性的O2氧物种的数量。然而，结构掺杂的发生仅限于Nb的几个百分点，而Ni0.85Nb0.15O1.225催化剂的优越性是由于存在一个覆盖NiO晶粒表面部分和非选择性活性位点的铌富集无定形氧化物相。NiO与薄的Nb富集混合氧化层之间的紧密相互作用，加上在ODH条件下可能的纳米复合材料重构，导致高Nb负载下催化剂显著失活。通过这种方法获得的最有效的ODH催化剂是那些含有3-4 at.% Nb的催化剂，它们结合了高活性、选择性和稳定性。
