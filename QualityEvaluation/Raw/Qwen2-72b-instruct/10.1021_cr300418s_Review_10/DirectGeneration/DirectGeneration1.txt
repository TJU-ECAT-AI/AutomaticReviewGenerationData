Niobium oxides, when used as dopants in NiO catalysts, exhibit unique properties and behaviors that significantly impact the efficiency of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Theoretical predictions suggest that the introduction of niobium oxides can alter the electronic structure of NiO, enhancing its catalytic activity and selectivity. This is attributed to the creation of oxygen vacancies and the modification of the surface properties, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of ethane molecules. However, bridging these theoretical insights with experimental realities presents several challenges. The precise control over the niobium oxide loading and its uniform dispersion on the NiO surface is crucial but difficult to achieve. Moreover, the stability of the doped catalysts under reaction conditions and the reproducibility of the catalytic performance across different batches are issues that require further investigation. Experimental methods, such as X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques, are essential for validating the theoretical models and understanding the true impact of niobium oxides on the NiO catalysts' performance in ethane ODH.
