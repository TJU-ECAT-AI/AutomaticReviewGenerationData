1. The literature does not provide specific information on how the diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that the introduction of niobium significantly modifies both structural and catalytic properties in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, increasing the reactivity toward ethane by more than 50% at the expense of a relatively small drop (10%) in ethene selectivity. The challenges in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations when studying these complex catalytic systems are not discussed in the literature.

1. 文献没有提供铌氧化物的多样性质，包括它们的各种稳定形式和氧化态，如何影响它们在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中作为NiO催化剂掺杂剂的行为的具体信息。但是，它确实提到，铌的引入显著改变了乙烷氧化脱氢的结构和催化性能，将乙烷的反应性提高了50%以上，代价是乙烯选择性相对较小的下降（10%）。文献中没有讨论在研究这些复杂的催化系统时，将理论预测与实验观察相协调的挑战。
