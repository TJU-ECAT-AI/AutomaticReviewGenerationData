[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
[8] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
[9] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
[10] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen. It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[11] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[12] "It is well-known (8, 9) that submonolayers of an oxide A (a generic name) supported on an oxide B (another generic name) are often better catalysts than the bulk oxide A or bulk oxide B."
[13] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
[14] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
[15] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[16] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
[17] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."
[18] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[19] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[20] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[21] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[22] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[23] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
[24] "The dependence on the method of preparation points to a shortcoming of the computations: there is practically no computational work in which surface morphology is systematically varied and its influence on the ability to break the CH bond is studied."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence the behavior of Nb-doped NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by altering the chemical properties of the dopant. The stability and reactivity of different niobium oxides, such as Nb2O5 and NbO, affect how Nb interacts with the NiO lattice and the gas phase during the ODH reaction.
2.Nb prefers the +5 oxidation state in the presence of sufficient oxygen, but its oxidation state in a doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment. This flexibility impacts the catalytic activity of the doped NiO.
3.Nb, as a dopant, acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused valence electrons when substituting for Ni in NiO. This can lead to increased binding of surface oxygen atoms, hindering the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of oxidation.
4.In the presence of oxygen, the behavior of the system becomes complex, with the possibility of O2 adsorbing on Nb and activating it, although this mechanism is ruled out for Nb-doped NiO(011) due to the strong binding of oxygen atoms to Nb.
5.NbO2, when considered as a low-valence dopant, can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, which is confirmed by DFT calculations. This behavior is similar to that of alkali or Ag atoms.
6.Nb has a high affinity for oxygen and a propensity to form pentavalent compounds, which can lead to the formation of Nb oxide clusters on the surface of NiO in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. This can result in a NbO3 cluster bound to the surface oxygen atoms.
7.The presence of Nb-rich phases in Nb-doped NiO is not ruled out, as evidenced by the formation of a second phase with an excess of Nb in some preparations. The kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time.
8.The specific area of doped NiO catalysts can be significantly larger than that of undoped NiO, which can affect catalytic performance. Doping with Nb or Zr increases the specific area, potentially enhancing reactivity.
9.Temperature programmed reduction and desorption techniques show that Nb-doped NiO has reduced hydrogen uptake and oxygen release compared to undoped NiO, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen.
10.The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants, as predicted by calculations, is observed in experiments, with high-valence dopants like Nb increasing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.
11.The ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond, as calculated, correlates with experimental observations, as do the trends in reducibility measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption.
12.The strong dependence of catalytic performance on the method of preparation is a significant factor, with different preparation methods leading to varying morphologies and catalytic activities.
13.The practical importance of the method of preparation is uncertain, as different morphologies may evolve into the same steady-state morphology after several days on stream.
14.Computational work has not systematically varied surface morphology to study its influence on the ability to break the CH bond, highlighting a shortcoming in the current computational approach.

1.铌氧化物因其各种稳定形式和氧化态而影响Nb掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为，改变掺杂剂的化学性质。不同铌氧化物如Nb2O5和NbO的稳定性和反应性影响Nb如何与NiO晶格和气相在ODH反应中相互作用。
2.Nb在存在足够氧气时倾向于+5氧化态，但其在掺杂氧化物中的氧化态可能因周围环境而异。这种灵活性影响掺杂NiO的催化活性。
3.Nb作为掺杂剂，由于其未参与化学键的价电子而充当强路易斯碱，当在NiO中替代Ni时。这可能导致表面氧原子的结合增强，阻碍Marsvan Krevelen氧化机制。
4.在氧气存在下，系统的行为变得复杂，O2可能吸附在Nb上并激活它，尽管由于氧原子与Nb的强结合，这种机制被排除在Nb掺杂NiO(011)之外。
5.将NbO2视为低价掺杂剂时，可以降低氧空位形成能，这已通过DFT计算得到证实。这种行为类似于碱金属或Ag原子。
6.Nb对氧气有高亲和力，并倾向于形成五价化合物，这可能导致在气相氧气存在下在NiO表面形成Nb氧化物簇。这可能导致NbO3簇与表面氧原子结合。
7.Nb掺杂NiO中存在Nb富集相的可能性并未被排除，如某些制备中形成Nb过量的第二相所证明。Nb向表面的迁移动力学可以解释某些Nb掺杂催化剂随时间的活性损失。
8.掺杂NiO催化剂的比表面积可能远大于未掺杂NiO，这可能影响催化性能。用Nb或Zr掺杂会增加比表面积，可能增强反应性。
9.温度程序还原和脱附技术表明，Nb掺杂NiO的氢吸收减少，氧气释放减少，与未掺杂NiO相比，表明表面氧的反应性发生变化。
10.计算预测的高价和低价掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中被观察到，高价掺杂剂如Nb增加了氧空位形成能。
11.计算得出的掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力与实验观察结果相符，H2-TPR或氧气热脱附测量的还原性趋势也是如此。
12.催化性能对制备方法的强烈依赖是一个重要因素，不同的制备方法导致不同的形态和催化活性。
13.制备方法的依赖性在实践中的重要性尚不确定，因为不同的形态可能在几天后流化成相同的稳态形态。
14.计算工作没有系统地改变表面形态来研究其对断裂CH键能力的影响，突出了当前计算方法的一个缺点。
