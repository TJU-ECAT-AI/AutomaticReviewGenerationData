[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "Our calculations find that the adsorption energy of O2 on top of the Nb dopant is 8.40 eV. The distance between the two oxygen atoms is much longer than any reasonable O2 bond length, and therefore the NbO2 group contains two O atoms (not a weakened O2 molecule)."
[8] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
[9] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen. It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[10] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[11] "It is well-known (8, 9) that submonolayers of an oxide A (a generic name) supported on an oxide B (another generic name) are often better catalysts than the bulk oxide A or bulk oxide B."
[12] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[13] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
[14] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."
[15] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[16] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[17] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[18] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[19] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[20] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
[21] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
[22] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
[23] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
[24] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
[25] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
[26] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
[27] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide?"
[28] "With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
[29] "In most cases, doping improved the catalytic performance, as compared to the undoped host oxide, by increasing the conversion, or the selectivity, or the area per gram of catalyst."
[30] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
[31] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties, including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The Nb dopant, with its preference for the +5 oxidation state and strong Lewis base character, can alter the reactivity of surface oxygen atoms, affecting the catalytic activity. However, the behavior of the system becomes complex in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, as seen in ODH reactions. The strong binding of O2 to Nb can lead to the formation of NbO2 or Nb oxide clusters on the surface, which may not be directly involved in the ODH reaction. The preparation method of doped oxides can also significantly impact the catalytic performance, with calcination at high temperatures potentially enabling Nb atoms to reach the surface and react with oxygen. The specific area of doped NiO can be larger than that of undoped NiO, affecting the catalytic activity. Temperature programmed reduction and desorption techniques show that doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and oxygen release, respectively. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability to break the CH bond and reducibility matching observations. However, the strong dependence on the method of preparation is a challenge, as is the inability of characterization methods to definitively prove the presence of substitutional dopants in the surface layer. The lack of experimental methods to determine surface morphology and composition at an atomic level under reaction conditions leads to approximate models in computations. To address these issues, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems are needed. The uncertainties in the field mean that computations should be used primarily to obtain qualitative trends and design rules, with doping generally improving the catalytic activity of oxides. However, the field is still in its exploratory phase, and much work remains to be done to fully understand and optimize doped oxide catalysts.

1.铌氧化物因其多样的性质，包括各种稳定的形态和氧化态，影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。Nb掺杂剂倾向于+5氧化态，并具有强烈的路易斯碱性，可以改变表面氧原子的反应性，影响催化活性。然而，在气相中存在氧气的情况下，如在ODH反应中，系统的反应行为变得复杂。O2与Nb的强结合可能导致NbO2或Nb氧化物簇的形成，这些簇可能不会直接参与ODH反应。掺杂氧化物的制备方法也会显著影响催化性能，高温煅烧可能使Nb原子到达表面并反应氧气。掺杂NiO的比表面积可能大于未掺杂的NiO，影响催化活性。温度程序还原和脱附技术表明，Nb掺杂会减少氢气的吸收和氧气的释放。计算中观察到的高价和低价掺杂剂的区别在实验中也可见，关于断裂CH键和还原性的趋势与观察结果一致。然而，制备方法的强烈依赖性是一个挑战，正如无法确定证明表面层中存在替代掺杂剂的表征方法一样。缺乏在反应条件下确定表面形态和组成原子水平的实验方法导致计算中使用近似模型。为解决这些问题，需要对具有各种缺陷的表面进行计算，并对模型系统进行实验。由于不确定性，目前应主要使用计算来获得定性趋势和设计规则，掺杂通常会提高氧化物的催化活性。然而，该领域仍处于探索阶段，需要做大量工作才能充分理解和优化掺杂氧化物催化剂。
