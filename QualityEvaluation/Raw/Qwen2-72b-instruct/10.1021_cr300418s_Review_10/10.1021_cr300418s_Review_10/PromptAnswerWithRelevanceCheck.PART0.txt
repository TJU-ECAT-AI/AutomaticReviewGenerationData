[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
[11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
[12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
[13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
[19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate. To bridge the gap between models and experiments, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are also necessary. Due to uncertainties, computations should be used mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of oxides, as shown by both computations and experiments. The interactions between Lewis acids and bases in surface chemistry have been explained by computations, which can be useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, although they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers. The work on doped oxides is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results are promising, and much remains to be done.

1.铌氧化物因其多样化的性质，包括各种稳定形态和氧化态，影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌氧化物的高形成能和NbO的稳定性增加了系统的复杂性。铌在掺杂氧化物中的氧化态可以根据其直接环境而变化，这影响了其反应性。铌掺杂剂由于其未使用的电子而充当强路易斯碱，这可以增加表面氧原子的结合并阻碍Marsvan Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，在气相中存在氧气的情况下，系统的反应行为变得复杂。铌氧化物簇在表面形成的性质尚未充分理解，铌向表面的分层动力学可以解释某些铌掺杂催化剂随时间的活性损失。催化剂制备方法对掺杂催化剂的性能有显著影响，不同制备方法之间观察到定性和定量的差异。掺杂催化剂中的较小颗粒具有更多缺陷，这可以增强化学活性。铌掺杂减少了氢气的吸收并降低了氧气的释放，表明表面氧的反应性发生了变化。计算中观察到的高价和低价掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中也可见，掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力和还原性的趋势与观察结果一致。对制备方法的强烈依赖令人惊讶，目前尚不清楚这种依赖是否具有实际意义。缺乏实验方法来确定反应条件下表面的形态和组成，使得计算中使用的模型近似。为了弥合模型和实验之间的差距，需要对具有各种缺陷的表面进行计算，并对类似于计算模型的模型系统进行实验。特别设计用于测试预测趋势的实验也是必要的。由于不确定性，目前应主要使用计算来获得定性趋势和设计规则。掺杂通常可以提高氧化物的催化活性，这一点得到了计算和实验的证实。表面化学中路易斯酸和碱之间的相互作用已通过计算得到解释，这在寻找有前途的掺杂氧化物对催化剂方面可能是有用的，尽管它们提供了可能的行为而不是绝对答案。对掺杂氧化物的研究是不完整的、零散的和探索性的，但结果是令人鼓舞的，还有很多工作要做。

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The stability and reactivity of these oxides, such as Nb2O5 being unreactive and NbO being stable, affect how Nb interacts with the NiO lattice. When Nb substitutes Ni in the oxide, its oxidation state can vary depending on the local environment, impacting the electronic structure and reactivity of the surface. The presence of unused electrons in Nb, making it a strong Lewis base, can alter the binding of surface oxygen atoms, potentially hindering the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of oxidation. However, in the presence of oxygen during ODH reactions, the system's behavior becomes complex, with the possibility of Nb forming oxide clusters on the surface or segregating over time, affecting the catalyst's activity. The method of catalyst preparation is crucial, as it can qualitatively and quantitatively change the performance of NiO in ethylene production or ethane combustion. While computational predictions and experimental observations generally align, showing the distinct effects of high- and low-valence dopants, the strong dependence on preparation methods presents a challenge. This dependence may not always be practically significant, as different morphologies could converge to a steady-state under reaction conditions. The lack of systematic computational studies on surface morphology and its influence on catalytic activity highlights a gap in understanding these complex systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。这些氧化物的稳定性和反应性，如Nb2O5的不反应性和NbO的稳定性，影响铌如何与NiO晶格相互作用。当铌取代Ni氧化物中的Ni时，其氧化态可以根据局部环境变化，影响表面的电子结构和反应性。铌存在未使用的电子，使其成为强路易斯碱，可以改变表面氧原子的结合，可能阻碍Marsvan Krevelen氧化机制。然而，在ODH反应中氧气存在的情况下，系统的反应变得复杂，铌有可能在表面形成氧化物簇或随时间分离，影响催化剂的活性。催化剂制备方法至关重要，因为它可以定性和定量地改变NiO在乙烯生产或乙烷燃烧中的性能。虽然计算预测和实验观察通常一致，显示出高价和低价掺杂剂的明显效果，但对制备方法的强烈依赖性构成了挑战。这种依赖性可能并不总是具有实际意义，因为不同的形态在反应条件下可能会收敛到稳态。缺乏对表面形态及其对催化活性影响的系统计算研究，突出了理解这些复杂系统的一个缺口。

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties, including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The Nb dopant, with its preference for the +5 oxidation state and strong Lewis base character, can alter the reactivity of surface oxygen atoms, affecting the catalytic activity. However, the behavior of the system becomes complex in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, as seen in ODH reactions. The strong binding of O2 to Nb can lead to the formation of NbO2 or Nb oxide clusters on the surface, which may not be directly involved in the ODH reaction. The preparation method of doped oxides can also significantly impact the catalytic performance, with calcination at high temperatures potentially enabling Nb atoms to reach the surface and react with oxygen. The specific area of doped NiO can be larger than that of undoped NiO, affecting the catalytic activity. Temperature programmed reduction and desorption techniques show that doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and oxygen release, respectively. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability to break the CH bond and reducibility matching observations. However, the strong dependence on the method of preparation is a challenge, as is the inability of characterization methods to definitively prove the presence of substitutional dopants in the surface layer. The lack of experimental methods to determine surface morphology and composition at an atomic level under reaction conditions leads to approximate models in computations. To address these issues, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems are needed. The uncertainties in the field mean that computations should be used primarily to obtain qualitative trends and design rules, with doping generally improving the catalytic activity of oxides. However, the field is still in its exploratory phase, and much work remains to be done to fully understand and optimize doped oxide catalysts.

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties, including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The Nb dopant, with five valence electrons, acts as a strong Lewis base when substituting a divalent cation in NiO, which can increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, the presence of oxygen in the gas phase during the ODH reaction complicates the system's behavior.
2.Experimental observations show that the properties of Nb-doped NiO catalysts are influenced by the method of preparation, with significant differences in catalytic activity depending on how the catalyst was prepared. The specific area of the catalyst also varies with the method of preparation, and doping with Nb increases the specific area compared to undoped NiO. Temperature programmed reduction and desorption experiments indicate that doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and oxygen release, respectively.
3.The distinction between the effects of high- and low-valence dopants, as predicted by calculations, is observed in experiments. The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond and the trends in reducibility are in agreement with experimental observations. However, the strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise and presents a challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations.
4.Current characterization methods are unable to definitively prove that the synthesis method has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant embedded in the surface layer. The lack of experimental methods to determine the surface morphology and composition at an atomic level under reaction conditions leads to approximate models in computations. To bridge this gap, calculations of catalysis on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Additionally, experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are necessary but have not been conducted.
5.Due to uncertainties in computational and experimental methods, computations should be used primarily to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of an oxide, as shown by both computations and experiments, although there are exceptions. Doping has been shown to increase conversion, selectivity, or the area per gram of catalyst in most cases. However, there are no known examples where deliberate doping of an oxide has led to a commercial catalyst.
6.Computations have been helpful in dividing oxide-dopant pairs into classes based on common chemical behavior and explaining aspects of surface chemistry through the interaction between Lewis acids and bases. They are useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, providing probable behavior rather than absolute answers. However, the work in this field is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, and much remains to be done.

1.铌氧化物因其多样化的性质，包括各种稳定形态和氧化态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，用于乙烷氧化脱氢。铌掺杂剂的化学性质可能通过其形成的氧化物来推测。铌氧化物中，Nb2O5具有最高的形成能，且非常不活泼。NbO具有最低的生成热（406 kJ/mol），是一种稳定的氧化物。在与氧结合时，铌倾向于+5氧化态，如果氧气充足的话。然而，当铌作为另一种氧化物的替代掺杂剂时，其氧化态可能取决于其直接环境。
2.铌掺杂剂有五个价电子，当它替代二价阳离子（如NiO中的Ni）时，有三个电子没有参与化学键。这些未使用的电子使掺杂剂成为强路易斯碱。高氧化态的掺杂剂在不可还原的氧化物中会增加邻近表面氧原子与氧化物的结合，从而阻碍Marsvan Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，在气相中存在氧气的情况下，即在ODH反应中，系统的性质变得复杂。
3.图9所示结构的性质尚未得到充分探索。在这些温度下，铌原子可能具有移动性，并有足够的时间到达表面，与气相氧气反应，形成铌氧化物簇或可能的镍铌酸盐（我们的计算尚未探索后一种可能性）。这种分选的速率可能很慢，可能解释了为什么一些铌掺杂的催化剂随时间失去活性。
4.柠檬豆催化剂的NiO比表面积为9.4 m2/g，而吴的NiO比表面积为90 m2/g。铌或锆掺杂的NiO比未掺杂的NiO具有大得多的比表面积。氢气程序升温还原显示，铌掺杂会降低氢气的吸收量。温度程序脱附显示，从铌掺杂的NiO中释放的氧气比未掺杂的NiO少。
5.计算中高氧化态和低氧化态掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中得到了观察。计算出的掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力的趋势与观察结果一致，氧热脱附的可还原性趋势也是如此。对制备方法的强烈依赖是一个意外。目前的表征方法无法确定合成方法是否产生了掺杂剂嵌入表面层的替代掺杂氧化物。
6.我们没有实验方法可以在反应条件下告诉我们表面的形态和组成在原子水平上。因此，计算中使用的模型是近似的。为了弥补这一模型差距，我们需要在具有各种缺陷的表面上进行催化计算，以获得它们重要性的估计。类似Freund等人开发的计算模型的模型系统实验也将非常有帮助。此外，有必要进行专门设计的实验来测试预测的趋势，但到目前为止还没有这样做。
7.由于这些不确定性，我们现在应该主要使用计算来获得定性的趋势和设计规则。最重要的问题是：掺杂是否提高了氧化物的催化活性？在少数例外的情况下，计算和实验都回答了是。在大多数情况下，掺杂与未掺杂的宿主氧化物相比，提高了催化性能，通过提高转化率、选择性或每克催化剂的面积。尽管有这样的改进，我们并不知道任何例子，其中氧化物的故意掺杂导致商业催化剂。
8.第二个问题是：计算是否有助于我们寻找更好的掺杂氧化物催化剂？到目前为止，它们帮助我们将氧化物-掺杂剂对分为基于计算化学行为的共同性的类别。它们根据路易斯酸和碱之间的强烈相互作用解释了表面化学的一些方面。如果理解它们提供的是可能的行为而不是绝对的答案，它们可能在寻找有前途的掺杂剂-氧化物对催化剂方面有用。

[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The adsorbed oxygen atoms are so strongly bound to Nb they cannot possibly be involved in the ODH reaction (Sabatier principle)."
[8] "Because O2 binds so strongly to Nb and the O atoms are unreactive, it seems reasonable to consider that the dopant is NbO2."
[9] "We have used calculations to test this hypothesis: if NbO2 is an LVD, then its presence will lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a neighboring oxygen site."
[10] "When doped oxides are prepared, it is common to calcine them at temperatures around 450 C for 4 or 5 h in the presence of oxygen. It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[11] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[12] "It is well-known (8, 9) that submonolayers of an oxide A (a generic name) supported on an oxide B (another generic name) are often better catalysts than the bulk oxide A or bulk oxide B."
[13] "One infers that small NbOx clusters supported on NiO are not as active as Nb-doped NiO."
[14] "However, this does not rule out the presence of a Nb-rich phase in Nb-doped NiO."
[15] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[16] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
[17] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."
[18] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[19] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[20] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[21] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[22] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[23] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
[24] "The dependence on the method of preparation points to a shortcoming of the computations: there is practically no computational work in which surface morphology is systematically varied and its influence on the ability to break the CH bond is studied."

1.Niobium oxides, with their various stable forms and oxidation states, influence the behavior of Nb-doped NiO catalysts in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by altering the chemical properties of the dopant. The stability and reactivity of different niobium oxides, such as Nb2O5 and NbO, affect how Nb interacts with the NiO lattice and the gas phase during the ODH reaction.
2.Nb prefers the +5 oxidation state in the presence of sufficient oxygen, but its oxidation state in a doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment. This flexibility impacts the catalytic activity of the doped NiO.
3.Nb, as a dopant, acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused valence electrons when substituting for Ni in NiO. This can lead to increased binding of surface oxygen atoms, hindering the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of oxidation.
4.In the presence of oxygen, the behavior of the system becomes complex, with the possibility of O2 adsorbing on Nb and activating it, although this mechanism is ruled out for Nb-doped NiO(011) due to the strong binding of oxygen atoms to Nb.
5.NbO2, when considered as a low-valence dopant, can lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, which is confirmed by DFT calculations. This behavior is similar to that of alkali or Ag atoms.
6.Nb has a high affinity for oxygen and a propensity to form pentavalent compounds, which can lead to the formation of Nb oxide clusters on the surface of NiO in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. This can result in a NbO3 cluster bound to the surface oxygen atoms.
7.The presence of Nb-rich phases in Nb-doped NiO is not ruled out, as evidenced by the formation of a second phase with an excess of Nb in some preparations. The kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time.
8.The specific area of doped NiO catalysts can be significantly larger than that of undoped NiO, which can affect catalytic performance. Doping with Nb or Zr increases the specific area, potentially enhancing reactivity.
9.Temperature programmed reduction and desorption techniques show that Nb-doped NiO has reduced hydrogen uptake and oxygen release compared to undoped NiO, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen.
10.The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants, as predicted by calculations, is observed in experiments, with high-valence dopants like Nb increasing the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.
11.The ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond, as calculated, correlates with experimental observations, as do the trends in reducibility measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption.
12.The strong dependence of catalytic performance on the method of preparation is a significant factor, with different preparation methods leading to varying morphologies and catalytic activities.
13.The practical importance of the method of preparation is uncertain, as different morphologies may evolve into the same steady-state morphology after several days on stream.
14.Computational work has not systematically varied surface morphology to study its influence on the ability to break the CH bond, highlighting a shortcoming in the current computational approach.

1.铌氧化物因其各种稳定形式和氧化态而影响Nb掺杂NiO催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中的行为，改变掺杂剂的化学性质。不同铌氧化物如Nb2O5和NbO的稳定性和反应性影响Nb如何与NiO晶格和气相在ODH反应中相互作用。
2.Nb在存在足够氧气时倾向于+5氧化态，但其在掺杂氧化物中的氧化态可能因周围环境而异。这种灵活性影响掺杂NiO的催化活性。

7.Nb掺杂NiO中存在Nb富集相的可能性并未被排除，如某些制备中形成Nb过量的第二相所证明。Nb向表面的迁移动力学可以解释某些Nb掺杂催化剂随时间的活性损失。
8.掺杂NiO催化剂的比表面积可能远大于未掺杂NiO，这可能影响催化性能。用Nb或Zr掺杂会增加比表面积，可能增强反应性。
9.温度程序还原和脱附技术表明，Nb掺杂NiO的氢吸收减少，氧气释放减少，与未掺杂NiO相比，表明表面氧的反应性发生变化。
10.计算预测的高价和低价掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中被观察到，高价掺杂剂如Nb增加了氧空位形成能。
11.计算得出的掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力与实验观察结果相符，H2-TPR或氧气热脱附测量的还原性趋势也是如此。
12.催化性能对制备方法的强烈依赖是一个重要因素，不同的制备方法导致不同的形态和催化活性。
13.制备方法的依赖性在实践中的重要性尚不确定，因为不同的形态可能在几天后流化成相同的稳态形态。
14.计算工作没有系统地改变表面形态来研究其对断裂CH键能力的影响，突出了当前计算方法的一个缺点。
