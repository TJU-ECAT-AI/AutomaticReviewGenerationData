[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[10] "The specific area of the NiO is 9.4 m2/g for Lemonidou catalyst and 90 m2/g for that of Wu."
[11] "NiO doped with Nb or Zr has a much larger specific area than undoped NiO."
[12] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[13] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[14] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[15] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[16] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[17] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
[18] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
[19] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
[20] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
[21] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
[22] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
[23] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
[24] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide?"
[25] "With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
[26] "In most cases, doping improved the catalytic performance, as compared to the undoped host oxide, by increasing the conversion, or the selectivity, or the area per gram of catalyst."
[27] "Despite such improvements, we are not aware of any example where a deliberate doping of an oxide leads to a commercial catalyst."
[28] "A second question is: Are computations helpful in our search for better doped-oxide catalysts?"
[29] "So far they helped us divide oxidedopant pairs into classes based on commonality in the calculated chemical behavior."
[30] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
[31] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties, including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The Nb dopant, with five valence electrons, acts as a strong Lewis base when substituting a divalent cation in NiO, which can increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, the presence of oxygen in the gas phase during the ODH reaction complicates the system's behavior.
2.Experimental observations show that the properties of Nb-doped NiO catalysts are influenced by the method of preparation, with significant differences in catalytic activity depending on how the catalyst was prepared. The specific area of the catalyst also varies with the method of preparation, and doping with Nb increases the specific area compared to undoped NiO. Temperature programmed reduction and desorption experiments indicate that doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and oxygen release, respectively.
3.The distinction between the effects of high- and low-valence dopants, as predicted by calculations, is observed in experiments. The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond and the trends in reducibility are in agreement with experimental observations. However, the strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise and presents a challenge in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations.
4.Current characterization methods are unable to definitively prove that the synthesis method has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant embedded in the surface layer. The lack of experimental methods to determine the surface morphology and composition at an atomic level under reaction conditions leads to approximate models in computations. To bridge this gap, calculations of catalysis on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Additionally, experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are necessary but have not been conducted.
5.Due to uncertainties in computational and experimental methods, computations should be used primarily to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of an oxide, as shown by both computations and experiments, although there are exceptions. Doping has been shown to increase conversion, selectivity, or the area per gram of catalyst in most cases. However, there are no known examples where deliberate doping of an oxide has led to a commercial catalyst.
6.Computations have been helpful in dividing oxide-dopant pairs into classes based on common chemical behavior and explaining aspects of surface chemistry through the interaction between Lewis acids and bases. They are useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, providing probable behavior rather than absolute answers. However, the work in this field is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, and much remains to be done.

1.铌氧化物因其多样化的性质，包括各种稳定形态和氧化态，影响其作为NiO催化剂中掺杂剂的行为，用于乙烷氧化脱氢。铌掺杂剂的化学性质可能通过其形成的氧化物来推测。铌氧化物中，Nb2O5具有最高的形成能，且非常不活泼。NbO具有最低的生成热（406 kJ/mol），是一种稳定的氧化物。在与氧结合时，铌倾向于+5氧化态，如果氧气充足的话。然而，当铌作为另一种氧化物的替代掺杂剂时，其氧化态可能取决于其直接环境。
2.铌掺杂剂有五个价电子，当它替代二价阳离子（如NiO中的Ni）时，有三个电子没有参与化学键。这些未使用的电子使掺杂剂成为强路易斯碱。高氧化态的掺杂剂在不可还原的氧化物中会增加邻近表面氧原子与氧化物的结合，从而阻碍Marsvan Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，在气相中存在氧气的情况下，即在ODH反应中，系统的性质变得复杂。
3.图9所示结构的性质尚未得到充分探索。在这些温度下，铌原子可能具有移动性，并有足够的时间到达表面，与气相氧气反应，形成铌氧化物簇或可能的镍铌酸盐（我们的计算尚未探索后一种可能性）。这种分选的速率可能很慢，可能解释了为什么一些铌掺杂的催化剂随时间失去活性。
4.柠檬豆催化剂的NiO比表面积为9.4 m2/g，而吴的NiO比表面积为90 m2/g。铌或锆掺杂的NiO比未掺杂的NiO具有大得多的比表面积。氢气程序升温还原显示，铌掺杂会降低氢气的吸收量。温度程序脱附显示，从铌掺杂的NiO中释放的氧气比未掺杂的NiO少。
5.计算中高氧化态和低氧化态掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中得到了观察。计算出的掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力的趋势与观察结果一致，氧热脱附的可还原性趋势也是如此。对制备方法的强烈依赖是一个意外。目前的表征方法无法确定合成方法是否产生了掺杂剂嵌入表面层的替代掺杂氧化物。
6.我们没有实验方法可以在反应条件下告诉我们表面的形态和组成在原子水平上。因此，计算中使用的模型是近似的。为了弥补这一模型差距，我们需要在具有各种缺陷的表面上进行催化计算，以获得它们重要性的估计。类似Freund等人开发的计算模型的模型系统实验也将非常有帮助。此外，有必要进行专门设计的实验来测试预测的趋势，但到目前为止还没有这样做。
7.由于这些不确定性，我们现在应该主要使用计算来获得定性的趋势和设计规则。最重要的问题是：掺杂是否提高了氧化物的催化活性？在少数例外的情况下，计算和实验都回答了是。在大多数情况下，掺杂与未掺杂的宿主氧化物相比，提高了催化性能，通过提高转化率、选择性或每克催化剂的面积。尽管有这样的改进，我们并不知道任何例子，其中氧化物的故意掺杂导致商业催化剂。
8.第二个问题是：计算是否有助于我们寻找更好的掺杂氧化物催化剂？到目前为止，它们帮助我们将氧化物-掺杂剂对分为基于计算化学行为的共同性的类别。它们根据路易斯酸和碱之间的强烈相互作用解释了表面化学的一些方面。如果理解它们提供的是可能的行为而不是绝对的答案，它们可能在寻找有前途的掺杂剂-氧化物对催化剂方面有用。
