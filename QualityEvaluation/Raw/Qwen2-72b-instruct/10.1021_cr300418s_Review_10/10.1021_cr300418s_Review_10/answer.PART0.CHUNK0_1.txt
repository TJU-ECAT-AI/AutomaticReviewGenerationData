[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
[11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
[12] "The trends predicted by computations compare fairly well with the experimental observations."
[13] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[14] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[15] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[16] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
[17] "The dependence on the method of preparation points to a shortcoming of the computations: there is practically no computational work in which surface morphology is systematically varied and its influence on the ability to break the CH bond is studied."

The diverse properties of niobium oxides, including their various stable forms and oxidation states, significantly influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. The stability and reactivity of these oxides, such as Nb2O5 being unreactive and NbO being stable, affect how Nb interacts with the NiO lattice. When Nb substitutes Ni in the oxide, its oxidation state can vary depending on the local environment, impacting the electronic structure and reactivity of the surface. The presence of unused electrons in Nb, making it a strong Lewis base, can alter the binding of surface oxygen atoms, potentially hindering the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism of oxidation. However, in the presence of oxygen during ODH reactions, the system's behavior becomes complex, with the possibility of Nb forming oxide clusters on the surface or segregating over time, affecting the catalyst's activity. The method of catalyst preparation is crucial, as it can qualitatively and quantitatively change the performance of NiO in ethylene production or ethane combustion. While computational predictions and experimental observations generally align, showing the distinct effects of high- and low-valence dopants, the strong dependence on preparation methods presents a challenge. This dependence may not always be practically significant, as different morphologies could converge to a steady-state under reaction conditions. The lack of systematic computational studies on surface morphology and its influence on catalytic activity highlights a gap in understanding these complex systems.

铌氧化物的多样性质，包括其各种稳定形态和氧化态，对它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为有重大影响。这些氧化物的稳定性和反应性，如Nb2O5的不反应性和NbO的稳定性，影响铌如何与NiO晶格相互作用。当铌取代Ni氧化物中的Ni时，其氧化态可以根据局部环境变化，影响表面的电子结构和反应性。铌存在未使用的电子，使其成为强路易斯碱，可以改变表面氧原子的结合，可能阻碍Marsvan Krevelen氧化机制。然而，在ODH反应中氧气存在的情况下，系统的反应变得复杂，铌有可能在表面形成氧化物簇或随时间分离，影响催化剂的活性。催化剂制备方法至关重要，因为它可以定性和定量地改变NiO在乙烯生产或乙烷燃烧中的性能。虽然计算预测和实验观察通常一致，显示出高价和低价掺杂剂的明显效果，但对制备方法的强烈依赖性构成了挑战。这种依赖性可能并不总是具有实际意义，因为不同的形态在反应条件下可能会收敛到稳态。缺乏对表面形态及其对催化活性影响的系统计算研究，突出了理解这些复杂系统的一个缺口。
