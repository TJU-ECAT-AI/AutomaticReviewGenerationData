[1] "We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant."
[2] "Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide."
[3] "In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment."
[4] "The Nb dopant has five valence electrons and when it substitutes a divalent cation (such as Ni in NiO) three of its electrons that are not tied up in chemical bonds. These unused electrons make the dopant a strong Lewis base."
[5] "A high-valence dopant in an irreducible oxide will increase the binding of neighboring surface oxygen atoms to the oxide, and this will hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
[6] "However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, which is always the case in an ODH reaction, the behavior of the system is complex."
[7] "The properties of the structure shown in Figure 9 have not been adequately explored."
[8] "It is possible that Nb atoms are mobile at these temperatures and have enough time to reach the surface, react with the gas-phase oxygen, and form Nb oxide clusters or perhaps a Ni niobate (our calculations have not explored the latter possibility)."
[9] "The kinetics of this segregation is likely to be slow and might explain why some of the Nb-doped catalysts lose activity in time."
[10] "The difference is both qualitative and quantitative: in one preparation, NiO is a fair catalyst for ethylene production, while in another, it combusts ethane."
[11] "These are qualitative differences: in Millets experiments, doping with Nb improves the performance, while in Capss experiment it decreases it; the method of catalyst preparation is clearly important."
[12] "The smaller particles are likely to have more defects (steps, kinks, etc.), and these are chemically active."
[13] "Temperature programmed reduction with H2 shows that doping with Nb reduces the hydrogen uptake."
[14] "Temperature programmed desorption shows that less oxygen is released from the Nb-doped NiO than from the undoped NiO."
[15] "The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments."
[16] "The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the CH bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption)."
[17] "The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise."
[18] "It is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology."
[19] "The characterization methods are unable to prove beyond doubt that the method of synthesis has produced a substitutionally doped oxide with the dopant imbedded in the surface layer."
[20] "We have no experimental methods that will tell us the morphology and the composition of the surface at an atomic level, under reaction conditions."
[21] "Because of this, the models used in computations are approximate."
[22] "To bridge this model gap, we need to perform calculations of catalysis on surfaces having a variety of defects to obtain an estimate of their importance."
[23] "Experiments on model systems that resemble more closely the models used in the calculations, such as those developed by Freund, (10-14, 249) for example, will also be very helpful."
[24] "Furthermore, it is necessary to perform experiments specifically designed to test the predicted trends, which has not been done so far."
[25] "Because of these uncertainties, one should use computations, at this time, mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules."
[26] "The most important question is: does doping improve the catalytic activity of an oxide? With a few exceptions, both computations and experiments answer yes."
[27] "They have explained some aspects of surface chemistry on the basis of strong interaction between Lewis acids and bases."
[28] "They are likely to be useful in prospecting for promising dopantoxide pair catalysts, if it is understood that they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers."
[29] "The work performed so far is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results obtained are promising and much remains to be done."

1.Niobium oxides, with their diverse properties including various stable forms and oxidation states, influence their behavior as dopants in NiO catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation by affecting the chemical properties of the dopant. The high energy of formation of Nb2O5 and the stability of NbO contribute to the complexity of the system. The oxidation state of Nb in the doped oxide can vary depending on its immediate environment, which affects its reactivity. The Nb dopant acts as a strong Lewis base due to its unused electrons, which can increase the binding of surface oxygen atoms and hinder oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. However, in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase, the behavior of the system becomes complex. The properties of Nb oxide clusters formed on the surface are not well understood, and the kinetics of Nb segregation to the surface can explain the loss of activity in some Nb-doped catalysts over time. The method of catalyst preparation significantly impacts the performance of the doped catalysts, with qualitative and quantitative differences observed between different preparations. The smaller particles in the doped catalysts have more defects, which can enhance chemical activity. Doping with Nb reduces hydrogen uptake and decreases oxygen release, indicating changes in the reactivity of surface oxygen. The distinction between high- and low-valence dopants observed in calculations is also seen in experiments, with trends in the ability of doped oxides to break the CH bond and in reducibility matching the observations. The strong dependence on the method of preparation is surprising, and it is unclear whether this dependence is practically important. The lack of experimental methods to determine the morphology and composition of the surface at an atomic level under reaction conditions makes the models used in computations approximate. To bridge the gap between models and experiments, calculations on surfaces with various defects and experiments on model systems resembling computational models are needed. Experiments specifically designed to test predicted trends are also necessary. Due to uncertainties, computations should be used mainly to obtain qualitative trends and design rules. Doping generally improves the catalytic activity of oxides, as shown by both computations and experiments. The interactions between Lewis acids and bases in surface chemistry have been explained by computations, which can be useful in prospecting for promising dopant-oxide pair catalysts, although they provide probable behavior rather than absolute answers. The work on doped oxides is incomplete, fragmented, and exploratory, but the results are promising, and much remains to be done.

1.铌氧化物因其多样化的性质，包括各种稳定形态和氧化态，影响它们在NiO催化剂中作为乙烷氧化脱氢反应的掺杂剂的行为。铌氧化物的高形成能和NbO的稳定性增加了系统的复杂性。铌在掺杂氧化物中的氧化态可以根据其直接环境而变化，这影响了其反应性。铌掺杂剂由于其未使用的电子而充当强路易斯碱，这可以增加表面氧原子的结合并阻碍Marsvan Krevelen机制的氧化。然而，在气相中存在氧气的情况下，系统的反应行为变得复杂。铌氧化物簇在表面形成的性质尚未充分理解，铌向表面的分层动力学可以解释某些铌掺杂催化剂随时间的活性损失。催化剂制备方法对掺杂催化剂的性能有显著影响，不同制备方法之间观察到定性和定量的差异。掺杂催化剂中的较小颗粒具有更多缺陷，这可以增强化学活性。铌掺杂减少了氢气的吸收并降低了氧气的释放，表明表面氧的反应性发生了变化。计算中观察到的高价和低价掺杂剂之间的区别在实验中也可见，掺杂氧化物断裂CH键的能力和还原性的趋势与观察结果一致。对制备方法的强烈依赖令人惊讶，目前尚不清楚这种依赖是否具有实际意义。缺乏实验方法来确定反应条件下表面的形态和组成，使得计算中使用的模型近似。为了弥合模型和实验之间的差距，需要对具有各种缺陷的表面进行计算，并对类似于计算模型的模型系统进行实验。特别设计用于测试预测趋势的实验也是必要的。由于不确定性，目前应主要使用计算来获得定性趋势和设计规则。掺杂通常可以提高氧化物的催化活性，这一点得到了计算和实验的证实。表面化学中路易斯酸和碱之间的相互作用已通过计算得到解释，这在寻找有前途的掺杂氧化物对催化剂方面可能是有用的，尽管它们提供了可能的行为而不是绝对答案。对掺杂氧化物的研究是不完整的、零散的和探索性的，但结果是令人鼓舞的，还有很多工作要做。
