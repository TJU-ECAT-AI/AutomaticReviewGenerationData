1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt and Pt-based alloys can be easily poisoned by small amounts of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream, and that the addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K. The literature also notes that the presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如何影响反应器研究中CO氧化，水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到Pt和基于Pt的合金可以被氢气流中少量的CO轻易毒化，并且将Co添加到Pt/YSZ中在423K以下的温度区域导致PROX催化性能的大幅提高。文献还指出，与载体相互作用的孤立双金属PtCo纳米粒子的存在似乎产生了高催化活性。未来的UHV研究可能能够提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解，但没有讨论基于Pt的双金属表面UHV研究的当前限制。
