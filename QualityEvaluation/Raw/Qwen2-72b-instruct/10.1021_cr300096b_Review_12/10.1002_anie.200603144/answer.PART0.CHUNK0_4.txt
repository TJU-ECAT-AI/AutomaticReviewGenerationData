1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt and Pt-based alloys are generally used as the anode of PEMFCs and are known to be easily poisoned by even small amounts of CO in the hydrogen-rich stream. The literature also reports that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到Pt和基于Pt的合金通常用作PEMFC的阳极，并且已知即使在氢气丰富的流中存在少量CO，它们也很容易中毒。文献还报告说，支持在钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）上的PtCo双金属催化剂即使在温度低于423K时，即使Pt含量仅为0.5wt%，在H2丰富的气体流中对PROX也非常有效。与支撑物相互作用的孤立的PtCo双金属纳米粒子的存在似乎导致了这种高催化活性。
