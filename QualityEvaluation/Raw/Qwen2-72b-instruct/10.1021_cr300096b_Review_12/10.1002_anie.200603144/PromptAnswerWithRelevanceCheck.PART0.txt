How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that supported platinum catalysts, including bimetallic PtCo catalysts, have been considered promising for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reaction due to their high catalytic performance. The PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a hydrogen-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，如何影响反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。然而，它确实提到，包括双金属PtCo催化剂在内的负载型铂催化剂由于其高催化性能而被认为对优选CO氧化（PROX）反应有希望。在温度低于423K时，即使Pt含量仅为0.5wt%，负载在钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）上的PtCo双金属催化剂在氢气丰富的气体流中对PROX反应具有高效率。与载体相互作用的孤立双金属PtCo纳米粒子的存在似乎导致了这种高催化活性。考虑到目前在基于Pt的双金属表面上进行UHV研究的局限性，未来的UHV研究可以提供将这些发现与模型表面和负载型催化剂相关联的见解。

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt and Pt-based alloys can be easily poisoned by small amounts of CO in a hydrogen-rich stream, and that the addition of Co to Pt/YSZ resulted in a large enhancement in catalytic performance for PROX, especially in the temperature region below 423K. The literature also notes that the presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed.

However, it does mention that Pt and Pt-based alloys are generally used as the anode of PEMFCs and are known to be easily poisoned by even small amounts of CO in the hydrogen-rich stream. The literature also reports that a PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a H2-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity.
