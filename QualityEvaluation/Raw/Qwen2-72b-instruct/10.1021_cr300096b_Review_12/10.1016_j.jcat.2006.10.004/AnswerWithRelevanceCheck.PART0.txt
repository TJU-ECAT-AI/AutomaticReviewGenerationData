          The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

          向Ni催化剂添加Pt可以增强催化性能，并在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷中给出更平坦的床层温度分布。PtNi物种在床层入口附近可以保持金属状态，这可以作为重整反应和燃烧反应的活性位点。通过顺序浸渍法引入的Pt原子更倾向于位于PtNi双金属颗粒的表面，这即使在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中气体相存在O2的情况下，也能增加催化剂床入口处还原Ni的数量。这表明添加Pt增强了Ni对氧化的抵抗力，且由于PtNi表面合金的分离差异，在顺序浸渍法中添加Pt比在共浸渍法中更有效。未来的UHV研究可以提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解，考虑到目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中的局限性。
