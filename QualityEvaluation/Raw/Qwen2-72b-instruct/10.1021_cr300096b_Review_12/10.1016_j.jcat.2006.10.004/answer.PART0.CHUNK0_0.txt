1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化率在反应器研究中的机制和效率的具体信息。但是,它确实提到在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷中,向Ni催化剂添加Pt可以增强催化性能,并使床温分布更平坦。通过顺序浸渍方法引入的Pt原子更倾向于位于PtNi双金属颗粒的表面,这即使在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷过程中气体相存在O2的情况下,也能增加催化剂床入口处的还原Ni量。这表明添加Pt增强了Ni的抗氧化性,并且由于PtNi表面合金的分离差异,在顺序浸渍方法中添加Pt比在共浸渍方法中更有效。未来的UHV研究可以提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解,考虑到目前在Pt基双金属表面的UHV研究中的局限性。
