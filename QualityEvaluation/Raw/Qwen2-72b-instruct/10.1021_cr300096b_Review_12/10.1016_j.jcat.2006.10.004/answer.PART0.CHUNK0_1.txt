1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the surface modification of Ni particles with Pt and its relationship with the catalytic performance.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到向Ni催化剂添加Pt可以增强催化性能，并在氧化蒸汽重整甲烷中给出更平坦的床层温度分布。PtNi物种在床层入口附近可以保持金属状态，这可以作为重整反应和燃烧反应的活性位点。未来的UHV研究可能将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联，为Ni颗粒表面改性与Pt的关系以及与催化性能的关系提供见解。
