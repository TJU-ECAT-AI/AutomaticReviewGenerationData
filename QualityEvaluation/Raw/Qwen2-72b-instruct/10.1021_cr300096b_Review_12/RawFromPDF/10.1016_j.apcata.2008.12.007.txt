Highly stable dealuminated zeolite support for the production of hydrogen by dry reforming of methane
Abstract
Dealuminated FAU type Y and BEA zeolites were used as supports for the dry reforming of methane. Ni and Pt (1 or 0.5 wt%) were impregnated on these carriers to produce both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The catalysts were characterized before and after exposure to reaction conditions by XRD, X-ray fluorescence, N2 adsorption, TGA, TPR, SEM, TEM and XPS analyses. The acidity of the fresh solids was also evaluated by TPD of ammonia and FT-IR measurements. The improvement of the accessibility with dealumination of the supports, as well as the high stability of the BEA zeolite support, generated high dispersion of the metals and improved catalytic activity of this solid. The FAU type Y supports show much more total acidity compared to that of BEA, which possess acid sites of medium strength. The results demonstrated that the bimetallic Ni–Pt/zeolite catalyst showed lower activity (e.g., NiPtY and NiPtβ activities were 1.70 and 1.90 gmetal−1 h−1, respectively) than that of the monometallic Pt/zeolite catalyst (e.g., PtY and Ptβ activities were close to 2.0 and 3.20 gmetal−1 h−1, respectively). NiY and Niβ were practically inactive, which could be attributed to the formation of deactivating whisker-like carbon deposits (approximately 60 wt%) on the metal particles, combined with the high acidity of the support, which was measured by FT-IR analysis. In the case of Pt dispersed on BEA zeolite, it produced lower carbon deposition (16 wt%) and this coke was easily removed by CO2. Dealuminated BEA zeolite appeared to be a promising candidate for dry reforming of methane application due to its high stability and selectivity during 24 h of time on stream, in comparison with alumina (activity = 0.90 mol gmetal−1 h−1), active carbon (activity = 2.30 gmetal−1 h−1), and other zeolites.

Dealumination improved the accessibility and increased the stability of BEA supports, generating better catalytic activity. Dealuminated BEA zeolite containing 1 wt% of Pt appeared to be a very promising candidate for dry reforming of methane, in comparison with other zeolite supports.

1. Introduction
In recent years, economical and sustainable industrial processes that can efficiently convert CO2 to a useful and non-polluting compound have become important. Specifically, the CO2 reforming of methane (reaction
(I)
) is an attractive way to utilize CO2, since it offers the following advantages over steam reforming (reaction
(II)
) and the partial oxidation of methane (reaction
(III)
): (i) it forms a suitable H2/CO ratio, i.e., nearly 1:1, for use in the synthesis of liquid hydrocarbons; (ii) it is better used in chemical energy transmission, and (iii) it can be used as an independent source for the production of synthesis gas, with the condition that some amount of an oxidizing agent, e.g., CO2 or O2/H2O, is added

CH4 + CO2 ↔ 2CO + 2H2 ΔH°298 K = 247 kJ mol−1

(III)
CH4 + (1/2)O2 ↔ CO + 2H2 ΔH°298 K = −35.7 kJ mol−1
Indeed, dry reforming of methane can be an important route for increasing the hydrogen production and reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Although the methane conversion process has been studied for over 100 years, beginning with Fischer and Tropsch, the biggest obstacle preventing commercialization of these processes is their endothermic nature, which requires high temperatures to obtain high conversion

. The practical goal thus becomes to optimize H2 production rates and selectivities by stable catalysts to avoid the formation of carbonaceous deposits or coking

For these reasons, the majority of studies have focused on testing coke-resistant catalysts and operating conditions for the reforming of methane with CO2

Amorphous solids such as SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, peroviskite, CeO2, La2O3, active carbon, and crystalline solids such as zeolites have been reported as catalyst supports for the reaction
[5]
,
[16]
,
[17]
. Among them, zeolites greatly improve both the activity and selectivity of the reaction because of their potential properties as supports for catalysts in reforming reactions, such as their microporous structure, high surface area, and high affinity for CO2 as adsorbents

. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the activity of metals supported on zeolites for the development of a metal-based catalyst for industrial applications of CO2 reforming of CH4.
Additionally, it is well known that zeolite supports have the potential to deliver very high metal dispersion and to provide a stable system. These remarkable properties, combined with a low potential for support–metal interaction and superior coke resistance, make zeolites important catalyst supports in the CO2 reforming of CH4
[5]
.
Ni is often suggested as the most suitable metal to be dispersed on zeolite support
[10]
,
[19]
; however, noble metals have higher activity and stability and are less sensitive to carbon deposition, whereas Ni is deactivated by coking. Thus, the combined effect of Ni and Pt can produce a coke-resistant catalyst.
Besides the metal, the catalyst support is also an important parameter for CO2 reforming of methane. Although the properties of BEA and FAU type Y zeolites as carriers for Ni–Pt catalysts have been recognized, a deeper understanding of the stability of Ni–Pt supported on the zeolites has not achieved yet. There are few reports that investigated the effect of these supports on the catalytic performance in the dry reforming of methane. Most of them focused on the properties of the two zeolites in converting methane, in terms of activity and thermal and mechanical resistance
[22]
,
[23]
. However, the causes of the deactivation of metal-modified FAU and BEA carriers during dry reforming are not clear.
With this goal in mind, the structural characterization of highly stable Ni–Pt supported on zeolites, and its catalytic performance for CH4 reforming with CO2, was studied. Monometallic samples containing Ni or Pt were also prepared to elucidate the role of the metal on the catalytic performance. Indeed, we investigated the influence of the acidity on the catalytic properties by using dealuminated supports, with the aim of clarifying the factors involved in controlling the stability, coking, and activity of the solids studied.
The properties of the prepared catalysts in terms of activity, catalyst stability, and coking resistance are reported and compared to Ni/alumina, Pt/other zeolite, and Pt/active carbon catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Commercially available zeolites such as NaY (Si/Al = 5.6) and Naβ (Si/Al = 13) were procured from Union Carbide and PQ Corporation, respectively. The NaY and Naβ zeolites (FAU type Y and BEA structures, respectively) were soaked in a 0.5 mol L−1 aqueous solution of ammonium nitrate with a ratio of 5 mL g−1 and stirred at 90 °C for 1 h. This was repeated three times, after which, the solid products were filtered, washed with de-ionized water, dried, and finally calcined at 500 °C under air flow for 2 h to obtain the protonic form of both zeolites.
The dealumination process of the protonic zeolites was performed as follows: the solids were calcined at 550 °C using a steam partial pressure of 12.5 kPa for approximately 6 h, after which the samples were refluxed in hydrochloric acid (3 mol L−1) at 100 °C for 1 h and subsequently washed thoroughly with de-ionized water in order to remove chloride species. A detailed description of the dealumination procedure was given in earlier publications
[24]
,
[25]
. Finally, the dealuminated HY and Hβ samples were obtained by calcination in air at 500 °C for 2 h. The dealuminated forms of the zeolites were used as carriers to prepare the catalysts.
The bimetallic Ni–Pt catalysts supported on HY or Hβ zeolites were prepared by a successive impregnation method using an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O followed by addition of H2PtCl6·6H2O in ethanol. The combined amount of Pt and Ni was 1 wt%. The solids were dried and calcined at 600 °C for 6 h in air. The calcined forms of the catalysts were designated as NiPtY and NiPtβ. In order to compare the nature of the support as well as the influence of Ni or Pt on the catalysts’ performance, monometallic Pt or Ni samples supported on each zeolite were also prepared. The individual contents of the Pt and Ni were both 1 wt%. The samples were labelled PtY, NiY, Niβ, and Ptβ.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as chemical analysis (AAS/ICP-OES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence, acidity measurements, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM).
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy was used to determine Pt and Ni contents in each sample synthesized. The measurements were performed with a sequential ARL model PerkinElmer 3410 instrument. Before the measurements, 0.1 g of the sample was dissolved in 40 wt% hydrofluoric acid solution and heated at 200 °C in a sand bath. The solution obtained was evaporated and dried, and a solution of 3.4 mL of nitric acid and 10 mL of water was added. To determine the silicon-to-aluminium ratio of the samples, the aluminium content (the elemental Si/Al composition) was determined by absorption atomic spectroscopy (AAS) in a Varian instrument.
XRD patterns were collected with a Rigaku (DMAXB model) diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (30 kV and 20 mA). Both fresh and spent catalysts were analyzed using this technique.
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were used to examine the porous properties of each sample by using nitrogen as the adsorbent at a liquid nitrogen temperature. The measurements were carried out in a Micromeritics ASAP 2002 instrument. Before the analysis, all samples were pretreated in vacuum at 100 °C for 12 h.
The surface element content and metal-to-silicon ratio of in situ reduced fresh samples were determined in an XPS Escalab MKII and VG apparatus in order to simulate the conditions of activation of the samples before the catalytic run. The source was Al Kα under a pressure of 10−8 mbar. The binding energies (BE) of Si 2p, Al 2p, Pt 4d5/2, and Ni 2p3/2 core-levels were recorded. The carbon content of the spent catalysts was also determined using this technique. C 1s was used as the reference at 284.8 eV.
Raman spectra were obtained for the fresh catalysts and the goal was to obtain structural information about the metal oxides on the surface of the zeolite support. A T64000 Jobim Ivon spectrometer equipped with a N2-cooled charge and a coupled device to detect the scattered light was used to acquire the spectra. The samples were excited with an argon laser of 5141 Å. Approximately 50 mg of the pure catalysts was made into self-supporting wafers and placed in the in situ Raman cell.
TPR measurements of fresh catalysts were carried out in a Micromeritics model TPD/TPR 2900 instrument, in the range of 50–1000 °C. A 5% H2/N2 mixture and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 were used. Before the analysis, samples of ca. 0.1 g were placed in a quartz tube reactor and heated under nitrogen at 100 °C for 2 h.
The acid properties of the fresh catalysts were determined by TG ammonia adsorption. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) profiles were recorded on a Shimadzu TGA 50/DTA 50 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For each measurement, approximately 20 mg of the sample was placed in a platinum holder. The sample was then flushed with He (25 mL min−1) and heated at 400 °C for 2 h under helium/nitrogen flow, cooled to 150 °C, and saturated with ammonia until equilibrium. Finally, the sample was flushed again with He (30 mL min−1) until the integrator baseline was stable.
The FT-IR spectra of adsorbed and desorbed pyridine were recorded to evaluate the surface acidity of the fresh samples. The self-supported wafers were degassed in a vacuum of 10−7 atm at 300 °C overnight. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were exposed to the vapour of pyridine, and thus pyridine IR spectra were recorded in a Shimadzu instrument. The desorption procedure for the pyridine probe was monitored stepwise by evacuating the sample at increasing temperatures of 150, 250, 350, and 450 °C.
X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) was used to obtain the Me/Si ratio on the bulk of both fresh and spent catalysts on a Rigaku (ZSX Mini II) instrument.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in order to determine the amount of carbon deposited on the samples after being used in the CO2 reforming of methane. The analyses were performed using a Shimadzu TGA 50/DTA 50 instrument, where 10 mg of each sample was introduced into a platinum microbalance pan that was heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 over the temperature range of 30–1000 °C. Additionally, the experiment was performed under a mixture of oxygen/nitrogen with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1.
The morphology of selected samples (spent catalysts) was examined by SEM in a Philips XL-30 coupled to an EDX Link Analytical QX-2000 instrument. TEM analysis of spent catalysts was performed in a Philips EM420 electron microscope operating at 120 kV, with a resolution of 0.17 nm. Samples were previously ground and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol. The solids were then deposited over a thin carbon film supported on a standard copper grid. The EDX analysis was performed using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX, Noram Voyager).
2.3. Catalyst evaluation for methane reforming with CO2
The catalyst evaluation was performed in dry reforming of methane at 1 atm in the range of 600–640 °C. In addition, the influence of the transition metal on the activity and the effect of zeolite support for the dry reforming were studied.
The catalytic test was carried out in a fixed bed stainless reactor. The reactor was placed in a vertical tube furnace. The amount of catalysts used was 70 mg, and the height of the catalyst bed was about 3 cm when compacted with quartz wool. The catalysts were activated at 650 °C in a flow of hydrogen (50 mL min−1) for 1 h prior to each catalytic run. The reactor was then cooled to the desired reaction temperature (600 °C) under atmospheric pressure in the presence of nitrogen and the reactant mixture (CH4/CO2 = 1). The total flow rate was always kept at 100 mL min−1. The products of the reaction were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Simple Chrom) connected to a TCD detector and CG 300 integrator. CO2 reforming of methane was also conducted at 640 °C. The most active catalysts were also evaluated under the last conditions for 24 h of reaction.
Platinum (1 wt%) was also dispersed on γ-alumina and active carbon to yield Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C references samples, respectively. Both samples were evaluated for the CO2 reforming of methane.

The results of the chemical analyses of the catalysts show that the experimental and theoretical values of Ni and Pt agree and are close to those of the 1 wt% monometallic and bimetallic series.
Table 1
also shows that the Si/Al ratios in the monometallic and bimetallic samples are higher than those in the starting dealuminated samples (HY and Hβ). Moreover, the aluminium content decreases markedly with the impregnation and calcination process. This may be due to the decrease in framework alumina of the steam-treated HY and Hβ zeolites, which is caused by further dealumination with impregnating metals and calcination of the solids. A marked increase in the Si/Al ratio is seen on the bimetallic NiPtY and NiPtβ samples compared to both FAU type Y and BEA supports. This strongly suggests that steam treatment at relatively low temperature followed by acid leaching leads to the removal of tetrahedral aluminium atoms (framework aluminium atoms) to form octahedrally coordinated aluminium atoms (Extra Framework Aluminium, EFAL species), as observed in earlier studies
[24]
,
[25]
.
3.1.1. Textural features of the solids
The porous properties obtained from N2 adsorption at −196 °C are also shown in
Table 1
. The dealumination of the supports is a result of hydrothermal treatment and acid leaching, and it changes the isotherm profiles from type I to type IV, indicating the formation of mesopores, in agreement with findings
[24]
. As a consequence, dealuminated HY and Hβ samples have specific surface areas of 685 and 600 m2 g−1 and micropore volumes of 0.10 and 0.19 cm3 g−1, respectively.
The textural values appear are much higher than those found for the protonic non-dealuminated FAU type Y and BEA supports, respectively 610 and 587 m2 g−1. Additionally, it can be noted that mesopores are formed on both HY and Hβ dealuminated supports, which is presumably related to a secondary system formed upon dealumination. This can explain the higher values of the textural parameters of the dealuminated zeolites, as compared to the non-dealuminated solids. The specific surface areas of both supports decreased after impregnating with the metals, and correspondingly the micropore volumes have diminished, with the lowest values observed for bimetallic NiPtY and NiPtβ samples, 0.06 and 0.17 cm3 g−1, respectively.
Over bimetallic NiPtY and NiPtβ, it can be inferred that alumina is removed progressively from the zeolite framework as impregnation of the metals proceeds
[25]
; thus, more micropores are left in the zeolite framework, which results in an increase of mesopore volume of the bimetallic samples. This is in accordance with the analysis from the Si/Al ratio for these samples.
3.1.2. XRD crystallinity
The XRD analysis was performed to understand the possible structural changes of the solids after the treatments (dealumination, impregnation, and calcination) to which they were submitted. X-ray diffractograms of fresh and spent samples are shown in
Fig. 1
.

Fig. 1. XRD spectra of (a) fresh and (b) spent catalysts.
Both fresh and spent samples are well crystallized materials, with the exception of the NiPtY and NiPtβ spent catalysis (
Fig. 1
b).
Moreover, neither XRD nor Raman spectroscopy detected any NiO or PtOx phases in the fresh or spent samples. Thus, it is reasonable to consider two possibilities: (i) these oxides are highly dispersed inside the mesopores, or (ii) PtOx and NiO species are present in low quantities, undetectable by Raman or XRD analysis. Because the first possibility is more likely, it can be concluded that no migration/sintering of the particle to the surface occurs after the catalyst test, even at the high temperatures and severe conditions to which the solids were exposed.
3.2. XPS measurements
The binding energy (BE) values of Si 2p and Al 2p levels are approximately 103.6 and 74.8 eV, respectively, for all in situ reduced samples.
In addition to this,

The Ni 2p3/2 spectral region of monometallic and bimetallic samples has BE values ranging from 852.9 to 853.1 eV, which is characteristic of Ni0
[26]
. XPS results also show BE values of Ni 2p3/2 core electrons in the range of 856–856.4 eV, which is recognized to be due to the non-reduced nickel ions interacting with the zeolite lattice oxygen, as found in earlier studies
[27]
,
[28]
. However, Ni0 was the most common species, as seen by the atomic percentages, except for the case of NiPtY.
The platinum-containing samples show BE values related to the 4d5/2 level at 314.8–315.0 eV. This corresponds to the presence of Pt0 in a weak interaction with the zeolite support
[29]
,
[30]
.
Additionally,
Table 2
shows the Ni/Si ratio evaluated by XPS for all reduced samples. The bulk Ni/Si atomic ratio determined by XRF is higher than those obtained via XPS experiments for both bimetallic and monometallic samples. This indicates that nickel can be distributed in the mesopores of the zeolite, as strongly suggested by the XRD, Raman, and textural properties results. The highest Ni/Si ratio is found on the Niβ and NiY samples. In the case of bimetallic samples, the XPS Ni/Si atomic ratios are also lower than those of the bulk Ni/Si ratios, due to the same considerations explained before. Indeed, platinum causes nickel dispersion
[5]
,
[16]
, and hence, the percentage of Ni2+ on bimetallic samples is higher then the monometallic ones, i.e., the reducibility of the nickel species is complicated by the presence of platinum.
It should also be noted that the Pt/Si bulk ratio increases in bimetallic samples, compared with the monometallic ones; this indicates that Pt adds to the dispersion of Ni, and the location of these metals is likely inside the mesopores. The Pt/Si surface ratio from XPS is not measurable due to the low content of Pt on the surface. It is also well known that Pt promotes higher dispersion of Ni on zeolites and this action hinders the reduction of nickel (dilution effect of Pt)
[7]
. This is consistent with the percentage increase in unreduced nickel (Ni2+) for the bimetallic samples.
Additionally, the Si/Al ratio calculated from the XPS data of bimetallic catalysts is almost the same as that of monometallic ones; this is an indication that EFAL species are leached during impregnation of support and thus migrate to the zeolite surface support. This hypothesis is consistent with the increase of the Si/Al ratio proven by the chemical analysis.
3.3. TPR analysis
The TPR profiles of both reduced bimetallic and monometallic samples are shown in
Fig. 2
.
Download: Download full-size image
Fig. 2. TPR profiles of the catalysts.
All Ni-containing monometallic samples exhibit two steps of reduction. The first step, in the range of 300–370 °C, is related to the reduction of NiO to Ni0 species (reaction
(IV)
). The second represents the reduction of nickel oxide in some interaction with the zeolite (reaction
(V)
), having a maximum at about 600–650 °C
[31]
.
(IV)
NiO + H2 → Ni + H2O
(V)
NiOx + xH2 → NiO + xH2O
In the case of BEA support, NiO particles that form on catalysts can react with protons of the zeolite to form Ni(OH)+; therefore, its reduction is more difficult than on a FAU type Y zeolite, whose Ni2+ cations can be located in sites belonging to sodalite cages (NiY curve, first peak) and hexagonal prisms (NiY curve, second peak), as observed by Suzuki et al.
[31]
.
However, in the case of the samples that exclusively contain Pt, two distinct behaviours can be observed: Ptβ exhibits only one peak at 380 °C, which corresponds to the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt0
(VI)
[32]
, while PtY has a peak and a small shoulder at 300 and 380 °C, respectively. These two reduction steps can be related to the reduction of Pt2+ located in the sodalite cages and in the hexagonal prisms of FAU type Y zeolite, respectively.
(VI)
PtO + (1/2)H2 → Pt0 + H2O
The H2 consumption can be determined by integrating the peak area under the TPR curve for the PtY and Ptβ, having an area ratio of 1.25 for PtY over Ptβ. This suggests that more platinum species can be reduced over the Ptβ catalyst, which is consistent with our report that there is stronger metal–support relation for PtY catalyst and this structure difference yields more reducible PtOx species.
By comparing the PtY and NiY samples, the different temperature shifts can be assigned to the formation of nickel silicates
[28]
of difficult reduction on NiY, whose peaks are broader than those of PtY. Indeed, XPS of the reduced samples previously indicated that in the case of NiY, the reduction of Ni species interacting with FAU type Y carrier is stronger than that of Pt species; therefore, the reduction of the latter is facilitated, as suggested by other authors
[22]
,
[28]
.
In the case of the bimetallic samples, NiPtβ undergoes a one-step reduction (410 °C) assigned to a mixed coordination sphere of nickel and platinum atoms that is characteristic of Pt metal species promoting the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni0
[5]
.
This finding is in contrast with the XPS analysis, which stated that Pt hinders the reduction of nickel on the solid surface by a dilution effect. We suggest that this apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that specifically on bimetallic samples, the percentage of unreduced Ni2+ is almost the same or much lower than that of Ni0. Consequently, the small amount of Ni2+ is reduced more easily even though Pt is present, as proven by the TPR curves.
Another fact to be explained is that the size of the peak of NiPtβ is smaller than that of Niβ. It is well known that the interaction between nickel oxide and the zeolite support can affect the reduction temperature. Thus, it is suggested that in the case of monometallic Niβ, the broad peak may be a result of a slow reduction of nickel oxide species interacting strongly with the support in the form of a nickel silicate structure
[23]
,
[28]
. The small peak for NiPtβ may be due to the interaction between Pt and Ni during the reduction of the oxide precursors, which the hydrogen consumption profile indicates is weaker than the interaction in Niβ.
In addition, two reduction peaks are clearly seen for the NiPtY bimetallic sample; the first peak (310 °C) corresponds to the reduction of the nickel species by interaction with reduced Pt particles present in the supercages of the Y zeolite. The second peak is around 500 °C and can be due to the migration of nickel from hexagonal prisms to sodalite cages that contain reduced Pt atoms, in line with previous studies

3.4. Acidity measurements

Acid site densities (total acidity) of the catalysts under study were determined by TPD of ammonia, and the results are given in

Ammonia is not the best test molecule to evaluate the acidity of Ni–Pt catalysts. However, in this case, our goal is to measure the overall effect of the acidic support and the metal on the total acidity of the catalysts.
The TPD profiles (not shown) exhibit peaks with two maxima, corresponding to low and high acid strength for all catalysts. Brønsted and Lewis sites were related to framework aluminium atoms charge compensated by acidic protons and to EFAL atoms, respectively
[33]
. The first peak at low temperature (LT) in the range of 117–350 °C corresponds to weak and medium Lewis acid sites, and the second (350–577 °C) is associated with the strength of Brønsted weak and medium acid sites. In the case of protonic FAU (HY sample), the complexity in the TPD spectra of ammonia has been reported
[34]
. Generally, the high temperature (HT) component of the TPD spectra is most likely to be associated with water desorption as a result of dehydroxilation of surface hydroxyl groups
[34]
. The HT Brønsted peaks of monometallic BEA and FAU type Y samples appear at temperatures ranges of 350–577 °C, whereas those of bimetallic ones appear over 577 °C.
The total acidity determined by TPD of ammonia measurements follows the order NiPtY > NiY ≈ PtY > HY > NiPtβ > Niβ > Ptβ ≈ Hβ, with FAU type Y zeolite being more acidic than BEA zeolite. The bimetallic impregnated catalyst acidity seems to be noted more clearly in the NiPtY sample, which has a higher concentration of acid sites than monometallic samples, as illustrated in
Table 3
. Moreover, NiY and PtY monometallic samples are more acidic than the other monometallic ones, probably due to the large amount of EFAL species present over these solids.
As the acid sites of medium or high strength are not present in the unsteamed HY and Hβ parent solids, the creation of such acid sites can be ascribed to dealumination of the samples. The enhancement in acid strength of bimetallic catalysts may be due to the creation of EFAL species upon impregnation/calcination.
The extension of dealumination, i.e., the impregnation of metals on the dealuminated zeolites followed by calcination, results in an increase of the Si/Al ratio mainly on bimetallic NiPtβ and NiPtY; it in turn influences the strength of the acid sites of these solids. The influence of the high acidity of FAU type Y zeolite is also clearly noted on the NiY and PtY samples.
3.4.2. Pyridine adsorption studies
The acidities of fresh samples were affected in a number of ways, as indicated by the TPD of ammonia. The pyridine adsorbed IR spectrum method was applied to characterize the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites of the dealuminated solids. In
Fig. 3
, a typical FT-IR spectrum of the adsorbed pyridine is shown for some of the samples studied.

Fig. 3. FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed at room temperature followed by evacuation at 350 °C over (a) NiPtY and (b) NiPtβ samples.
For both series of solids, the band at approximately 1490 cm−1 is due to the C–C stretching vibration of pyridine adsorbed on both Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites
[35]
,
[36]
.
The peaks at 1548 and 1450 cm−1 are related to the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively. As the pyridine kinetic diameter is larger than that of ammonia
[24]
, a reliable determination of the concentration of the surface acid sites (mmol h−1) is obtained from the integrated peak areas after pyridine desorption at different temperatures.
The concentration of the Brønsted acid sites appears to decrease more rapidly in comparison with that of Lewis acid sites. Thus, at 350 °C the concentration of Lewis acid sites is greater than that of the Brønsted sites for all the samples studied (
Table 4
).
Table 4. Brønsted and Lewis acid site concentrations (mmol g−1) of the fresh catalysts, measured by FT-IR desorbed pyridine at 350 °C.
Samples Brønsted (mmol g−1) Lewis (mmol g−1)
NiY 0.21 0.24
Niβ 0.10 0.15
PtY 0.19 0.20
Ptβ 0.09 0.12
NiPtY 0.23 0.26
NiPtβ 0.13 0.17
This can be attributed to the EFAL species such as AlOH, Al(OH)2+ or Al(OH)2+ inside the zeolite channels, which are generated by dealumination and the successive impregnation and calcination treatments on the samples
[37]
. These results agree well with the textural property assumptions previously described. Indeed, a proper number of cationic EFAL species may compensate for the framework charge of the FAU type Y and BEA zeolites, resulting in a decrease of the Brønsted acid sites
[36]
. Therefore, the large number of EFAL species on the NiPtY, NiY, and PtY samples may be the reason for the stronger acidity of these samples, in comparison with the NiPtβ, Niβ, and Ptβ samples. The sum of the Lewis and Brønsted acidities is in the following order: NiPtY > NiY > PtY > NiPtβ > Niβ > Ptβ ≈ Hβ, which is consistent with the trend of acidity values measured by the TPD of ammonia.
3.5. Catalytic activity
The CO2 reforming of methane is performed as a test reaction to study the stability of the zeolite supports and their coking resistance on monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. This reaction is quite interesting for metal–support interaction studies in catalytic processes

[20]
. The conversion of methane is given in
Table 3
.
Not surprisingly, the HY and Hβ supports were inactive in the reaction. It is well known that CH4 reforming works efficiently over bifunctional solids with acid and metal functionalities
[16]
,
[17]
, which can explain the lack of activity when using the protonic forms of zeolites in the reaction (
Table 3
).
The catalytic activities of the monometallic Ni-containing zeolites in the dry reforming of methane also reveal that the conversion of methane is too low, reaching values close to zero most of the time. On the other hand, with the addition of Pt onto the carriers, e.g., PtY and Ptβ samples, methane conversion is observed. In particular, the conversion level of Ptβ reaches 31% in the first minutes of the reaction, whereas PtY displays a modest conversion (2%). This behaviour can be attributed to the secondary mesopore system formed on the BEA zeolite carrier by means of dealumination, which enhances the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites previously located inside the pore. This is in good agreement with the textural analysis of the PtY and Ptβ that shows the mesopore system.
In the case of PtY, the open type structure of the FAU type Y zeolite was expected to perform well; however, Pt can be located inside small cavities that are inaccessible by reactants, thus explaining the low conversion of methane on the PtY catalyst.
The NiPtY and NiPtβ bimetallic samples show very similar catalytic performance, measured by moles of methane reacted per gram of metal dispersed, and expressed as activity in the first minutes of the reaction (
Table 3
and
Fig. 4
).

Fig. 4. Catalytic activity in the CO2 reforming of methane at (a) 600 °C and (b) 640 °C, at atmospheric pressure and with a CO2/CH4 ratio of 1.
This strongly suggests that in the initial stage of the reaction, the catalytic activity is independent of the support. In other words, the activity is approximately 1.30 gmetal−1 h−1, indicating that Ni–Pt is an active site for the reaction (
Fig. 4
a). This can be justified by the fact that the presence of Pt strongly enhances the performance of Ni-based catalysts, both in terms of activity and stability due to the presence of a second metal (Pt), exposing the Ni to the reactant in the case of bimetallic samples. As a consequence, a redispersion of Ni generated by the addition/dispersion of a second metal (Pt) is achieved. This is in line with other studies on zeolite supports for the dry reforming of methane
[5]
.
However, on both FAU type Y and BEA supports, the catalysts deactivate, but the deactivation is much higher for NiPtY. Interestingly, this result indicates that the acidity of FAU type Y zeolite is responsible for the drop in the catalytic activity of NiPtY, as indicated by the TPD of ammonia experiments.
When comparing the influence of the metals, it is observed that the NiY and Niβ monometallic samples are quite inactive. Nevertheless, by adding Pt, the catalytic activity is increased to rates similar to Pt supported zeolite catalysts. The Ptβ sample (activity of 1.90 gmetal−1 h−1) exhibits stable performance for longer times, as shown in
Fig. 4
.
The H2/CO ratios observed in the different catalysts studied are in the range from 0.80 to 0.86 (less than 1). This may be attributed to a reverse water gas shift (WGS) reaction:
(VII)
CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O ΔH298 K = 41 kJ mol−1
Reaction
(VII)
can occur simultaneously with methane reforming, according to prior findings
[7]
,
[17]
.
On one hand, the catalytic activity is found to drop drastically during the reaction when using the bimetallic catalysts. On the other hand, monometallic Ptβ exhibits the best performance in terms of stability. Therefore, the positive effect of adding Pt and Ni together should be noted, considering that NiY, PtY, and Niβ are quite inactive (less than 0.20 gmetal−1 h−1 of activity).
Additionally, by increasing the reaction temperature from 600 to 640 °C, the catalytic activity increases, when comparing
Fig. 4
a and b. In this case, it can be assumed that the high temperature is necessary to furnish the heat needed to activate the reactants. A reference catalyst, PtC (Pt/active carbon), was also evaluated. Again, Ptβ is more active (activity = 3.20 gmetal−1 h−1) and stable than a conventional Pt/active carbon used in steam reforming of methane (activity = 2.30 gmetal−1 h−1).
The activities of NiPtY and NiPtβ slightly increased with increasing temperature to 1.96 and 1.70 gmetal−1 h−1, respectively; however, deactivation by coking decreased the conversion to values close to zero after 500 min of time on stream, in case of NiPtY while NiPtβ was further deactivated within 2 h of reaction.
It is noted that PtC displayed behaviour similar to Ptβ; however, after 500 min of reaction, the conversion of the Pt/active carbon dropped because of the consumption of the support by CO2
[8]
,
[17]
. In case of NiPtβ, the activity was stabilized in 2.5 mol h−1 gmetal−1, after 2 h of reaction. Thus, among the solids studied, Ptβ is the most active catalyst for the dry reforming of methane.
3.6. Characterization of spent catalyst
Initially, one of the most important questions was whether dealuminated catalysts are active in the dry reforming of methane. Knowing the performance of the Ptβ catalyst, a question remained about its stability. To answer that, some complementary characterizations of spent catalysts by XPS, TGA, SEM, and TEM analysis were performed.
The overall effects of coking rate, type of carbon deposition, metal sintering, and operative conditions contributes to the decrease of stability and the lifetime of the catalysts. In this work, the consequences of coke deposition were analyzed to explain the stability of Ptβ in comparison with the other samples through the aforementioned characterization of spent catalysts.
3.6.1. TGA and Raman of spent catalysts
TGA experiments in an oxidative atmosphere were performed in order to elucidate the origins of the catalyst deactivation during CO2 reforming of methane. The analysis determined the amount of carbon deposited over the solids from the spent catalysts tested at 600 °C (
Fig. 5
). The percentages of weight loss for all the samples studied are given in
Table 5
.

Samples % weight loss Type of carbon (Raman studies)
[5]
,
[39]
NiY 74 Amorphous carbon
Niβ 61 Graphite-like carbon + filamentous carbon
PtY 53 Graphite-like carbon + amorphous carbon
Ptβ 16 Graphite-like carbon
NiPtβ 23 Graphite-like carbon + filamentous carbon
NiPtY 48 Graphite-like carbon + filamentous carbon + amorphous carbon
From
Table 5
, it can be seen that the samples with 1 wt% of nickel, e.g., NiY and Niβ, show the most weight loss. By comparing both nickel supported samples, it is evident that the absence of very strong acid sites on BEA support results in the lowest deposition of carbon; consequently, spent Niβ has 61% weight loss due to the removal of coke deposited on the spent solid surface. Additionally, PtY carbonaceous deposition, which excludes Pt as the factor that alleviates coke formation, is due to the very high acidity of the FAU type Y support (measured by TPD and pyridine adsorption studies).
Despite NiPtβ and NiPtY samples having the lowest amount of nickel compared to the monometallic parent samples, the large accumulation of carbon may be ascribed to Ni0 (observed by XPS), which favours the growth of carbon species on the solid surface. This phenomenon is observed especially on NiPtY, which has the highest acidity of the bimetallic samples. A 48% weight loss was observed on NiPtY, and is related to carbon deposition on the solid. This result is in accordance with previous reports that concluded from TG/DTA analysis of coked Ni–Pt-based samples with low content of nickel that active sites of Ni0 enhance carbon deposition on the surface of the solids
[38]
. Additionally, it is important to consider that metal oxidation is negligible during the TG analysis.
Thus, among the samples studied, the optimum balance between platinum metal and BEA support (Ptβ sample) seems to produce the best conditions for catalysts with enhanced resistance to coke formation, as seen by the TG value of weight loss for Ptβ (16%).
Several authors have observed the elimination of coke over various supports using TGA/DTA and Raman experiments. The type of carbon formed (bulk carbide, adsorbed atomic carbon, amorphous carbon, and crystalline graphite) was associated with the temperature in the DTA experiments
[5]
,
[39]
. The nature of the carbon deposit on the samples is reported in
Table 5
.
Interestingly, a large amount of graphite-like carbon was formed over the samples that have the lowest weight loss, while filamentous amorphous carbon was formed together with a very low amount of graphite over the samples that have higher weight loss, as shown by the Raman results. An important new piece of information obtained from these analyses is that difficult to eliminate coke, i.e., filamentous and amorphous carbon, is most likely deposited on Ni on the most acidic support (NiY and NiPtY samples). The routes for carbon formation include decomposition of the methane feedstock
(VIII)
and the Boudouard reaction
(XIX)
:
(VIII)
CH4 ↔ coke + 2H2
(XIX)
2CO ↔ coke + CO2
Other reactions can also occur:
(X)
CO + 2H2 ↔ H2O + C
(XI)
CO2 + 2H2 ↔ 2H2O + C
These reactions represent the formation of the various possible forms of carbon at the surface of the catalysts. They are consistent with the idea that the high temperatures used for CO2 reforming of methane expose the catalysts to the formation of superficial carbon deposits due to the formation of C–C and CC bonds containing hydrocarbon chains at the exposed catalyst surfaces
[39]
,
[40]
. Thus, the very fast deactivation of NiY, Niβ, PtY, and NiPtY catalysts occurs predominantly by covering the active metals species by encapsulating carbon (amorphous and filamentous carbon) formation.
3.6.2. XPS of coked catalysts
XPS analysis of spent catalysts is a technique available for the characterization of the nature of coke formed on the sample and for quantification of the extent of coking. The results obtained from the XPS experiments are given in
Table 6
.

It is apparent from the results that the typical graphitic C 1s shape is related to a pure sp2 state according to the BE obtained. According to the analysis, this species is the major type of carbon deposited on the sample. Carbon is known to assume a large number of configurations, resulting in a variety of possible states of organization or disorder
[41]
. Many of them are conductive, and when bonded to oxygen, i.e., in C–O and CO linkages, the peaks are added to the total C 1s spectrum fitting at fixed BE values of 286.7 and 288.9 ± 0.3 eV (FWHM ≈ 2.0 eV)
[40]
,
[41]
. These BE values are related to graphitic-like carbon that is found on all the solids studied, an exception of NiY sample.
Additionally,
Table 6
clearly shows that besides graphite-like carbon (BE = 286.7–288.9 eV), filamentous amorphous carbon (BE = 281.5–284.8 eV) also appears on the surface of the solids, regarding the percentage of these species for each corresponding BE of C 1s. In the case of monometallic Ni-containing samples, the BE of about 282.2 eV is indicative of the large amount of amorphous carbon filaments. However, it is evident that on monometallic Ptβ, the amount of filamentous carbon (
Table 6
) is very low compared to those on Ni-containing zeolite, but high in graphite-like carbon (approximately 58 wt%). In contrast, the Pt-containing FAU type Y carrier possesses a large amount of amorphous carbon (2 wt%), as compared to the parent Ptβ monometallic sample, in accordance with the Raman results (
Table 5
).
It is well known that filamentous carbon can extensively diminish the catalytic activity in reforming reactions because it covers the surface of active sites of Ni particles, and thus, its elimination by CO2 is difficult. This may explain the lack of activity of the NiY and Niβ samples. In the case of PtY, the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon on metal particles (46 wt%) deactivates the catalysts very quickly. In this case, Pt does not avoid the deactivation of the solids, probably because of the large amount of deactivating carbon formed on the solid surface.
The behaviour of Ni–Pt bimetallic samples is quite similar to that of Ptβ; in others words, NiPtY and NiPtβ produce a large amount of graphite-like carbon and a small amount of filamentous carbon. In addition, by comparing monometallic Pt on zeolite support with the bimetallic ones, Ptβ zeolite has essentially graphite-like carbon, and hence, accumulation is alleviated by CO2 and the temperature of the reaction. Such a phenomenon is also observed in the literature with other zeolite supports
[5]
,
[39]
.
Table 6
also shows that the metal-to-silicon ratio of the spent catalyst is not available in the case of Ni/Si ratio, probably because of carbon deposits covering the nickel surface of the samples. In contrast, Pt/Si ratio values show that Pt migrates to the solid surface, as seen in the Ptβ, PtY, NiPtβ, and NiPtY samples, the latter being crowded by Pt on surface. This can explain the drop in the catalyst activity exhibited by PtY, NiPtβ, and NiPtY samples because Pt is covered with carbonaceous deposits.
Although some general conclusions have been drawn about the coke resistance of the solids, the detailed explanation for the stability of the BEA support still remains unclear. In order to elucidate the coke resistance of the catalyst, the C/Si ratio was calculated (
Table 5
).
The difference in behaviour between the Ptβ monometallic and the bimetallic catalysts may suggest that the bimetallic ones are less resistant to carbon deposition, which is confirmed by C/Si results of the NiPtY and NiPtβ samples. This agrees well with the TGA results of spent catalysts (
Table 5
). Moreover, the results indicate that both the presence of Pt and the acidity of the samples strongly influence the degree of coking. For instance, the most acidic catalyst (
Table 3
,
Table 4
) has poor resistance to carbon deposition, but shows considerable activity. This can be ascribed to the ability of small amounts of noble metals, e.g., 1 wt% of platinum, to avoid the formation of difficult to eliminate coke, as seen in Ptβ.
Beyond these advantages, BEA dealuminated support does not permit the accumulation of carbon on the active sites due to its accessibility generated by the dealumination process. The carbon species which could eventually be located inside the pores diffuse to the active sites. When this occurs, graphite-like carbon can be removed by the CO2 present in the reaction mixture, leading to stable performance of the Ptβ catalyst.
3.6.3. SEM and TEM analysis of spent catalysts
The topographical features of the spent FAU type Y and BEA zeolite catalysts are shown by scanning electron microscopy analysis, in

SEM micrographs of spent catalysts show a higher amount of carbonaceous deposits (amorphous filaments) on NiY, PtY, and NiPtY catalysts in
Fig. 6
a, b and c, respectively. This confirms that the acidity of the support and the nature of metal, e.g., nickel, influence the carbon growth during CO2 reforming of methane. Bimetallic NiPtY catalyst was also covered by carbon species. However,
Fig. 6
clearly indicates that during the reaction, the carbon deposition is diminished and is almost not visible on NiPtβ and Ptβ (
Fig. 6
d and e, respectively). This can explain the high coke resistance of these solids during the catalytic test. Indeed, we inferred that it is not possible to estimate, from SEM analysis, the carbon deposition level and thus, the above-mentioned study is only qualitative.
A TEM image of NiPtY spent catalyst is shown in
Fig. 7
. The analysis gives valuable information about the size of the metal particle and its spatial distribution. Although the particles are conformed by a mixture of carbon and metal, the analysis permit to estimate the possible effects related to the sintering of the particles, after the catalyst test. The black dots on the support matrix are particles of the metals on the surface of the supports. The metal particle size distribution for all samples measured by TEM analyses is in the range of 3–15 nm (
Table 6
), dominated by large (in the case of monometallic samples that contain nickel) and small particles (in the case of monometallic samples that contain platinum).

Fig. 7. TEM image of NiPtY catalyst.
No remarkable difference in the particle shape between the monometallic and bimetallic samples is observed. The average size of the particles on each support is presented in
Table 6
. The average particle sizes of catalysts PtY and Ptβ were found to be 5.46 and 3.50 nm, respectively, and those of bimetallic catalysts NiPtβ and NiPtY were 9.56 and 4.32 nm, respectively.
It is interesting to note that in the case of bimetallic catalysts, TEM results show that the addition of Pt to the Ni/zeolite catalyst can enhance surface Ni dispersion. Therefore, the improvements in activity and stability of the PtNiY and PtNiβ catalysts are partly attributed to the promotion of Ni dispersion.
In the case of bimetallic catalysts, the particles are larger in size compared to the pores of zeolite BEA (5.2 Å × 7.2 Å and 6.5 Å × 5.6 Å) and FAU type Y (7.5 Å) supports. From these results, it can be concluded that platinum and nickel are partially located outside the zeolite particles and form relatively large clusters. This may indicate a thermal mobility during the reforming of methane with CO2, and thus these particles may be located mainly outside the pores. In contrast, monometallic PtY and Ptβ catalysts have smaller Pt particles that are located at specific sites in the zeolite crystal and the particles remain well dispersed, even after the catalyst test. This is in good agreement with the XPS results of spent catalyst, which show that Pt is almost not identified in the external region (surface of the solids).
TEM investigations of the spent catalysts do not show any difference in the metal size distribution and the shape of the metal particles compared to that of the fresh catalyst, in the case of both the FAU type Y and BEA supports. It is only observed that Pt dispersed on BEA supports is resistant to sintering effects, and hence the catalytic activity and stability are greatly improved for Ptβ.
3.7. Comparison with others supports
Among the solids studied, Ptβ exhibits the best stability in regard to coke resistance; therefore, we measured the performance of other supports (active carbon, alumina) to compare with the FAU type Y and BEA supports after 24 h of reaction (
Fig. 8
).

Ptβ was shown to give the highest methane conversion (20%), while PtC (5%) gave the lowest, after 24 h of reaction. It also should be emphasized that the Pt/Al2O3 and PtY samples completely deactivated within a few hours of reaction, probably due to the highest combined acidity of the Brønsted and Lewis sites of FAU type Y and γ-Al2O3
[7]
, which favours carbon deposition. No further investigations were carried out because clogging of the reactor tube due to coke formation occurred, rapidly deactivating the PtY and Pt/Al2O3 samples. The reason for the difference in catalytic activity of Ptβ and PtC can be related to the support; over PtC, active carbon support was consumed by CO2 and decreased the catalytic activity after 24 h of reaction, whereas Ptβ worked efficiently during the evaluation period with only a slight loss of activity due to the aforementioned effects on its properties.
4. Discussion
Dealumination of zeolites is a well known method for improving the accessibility of the active sites of catalysts to the reactants. Under the action of water molecules, aluminium atoms are removed from framework positions that are occupied by Si atoms, which can enhance both the accessibility and acidity of the zeolite
[24]
,
[25]
. Dealumination by steaming of FAU type Y and BEA (β) zeolites followed by impregnation of Pt and Ni produced monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for the dry reforming of methane. No peaks corresponding to PtOx or NiO oxides were found in the fresh or spent catalysts used in the CO2 reforming of methane, suggesting that there is no migration/sintering of the particles to the solid surface after the catalyst test. The fresh oxides are highly dispersed in the mesopores that are formed upon dealumination, which is further confirmed by the textural properties and the Raman and XRD analyses.
Protonic large pore BEA zeolite (Hβ) has a three-dimensional channel structure with interlinking channels and pore openings of 5.7 Å × 7.5 Å
[42]
,
[43]
, whereas FAU type Y zeolite (HY) possesses the same characteristics, with the exception of a pore diameter of 7.4 Å that leads to a larger cavity with a diameter of 12 Å
[42]
. Thus, the dealumination on both carriers provides a more open structure of the solids, facilitating the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites and also to avoid blocking of the pores by coking.
The surface area and pore volume gradually decrease with the presence of metals, and thus, these textural parameters values become significantly lower as the Ni–Pt impregnation proceeds over the dealuminated FAU type Y and BEA bimetallic samples (
Table 1
). These results indicate that the amount of EFAL compounds on the bimetallic samples is remarkably high, as compared with those of the NiY, PtY, Niβ, and Ptβ dealuminated monometallic catalysts. Therefore, the influence of pore blocking due to EFAL species cannot be neglected in the subsequent impregnation of Pt in the case of the bimetallic samples.
Hence, it is observed that the impregnation/calcination process leads to additional dealumination of the zeolite support and creates a mesopore system on the solids; this is seen mainly in NiPtβ, which has the greatest pore volume (0.34 mL g−1). This is consistent with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of the solids. From these results, it can be suggested that the dealumination of the zeolite carriers appears to be a powerful tool to change the chemical composition of the solids by varying the Si/Al ratio of the materials.
Additionally, dealumination of the zeolite carriers actually causes modification of the strength and nature of the acid sites. In general, FAU type Y-based-catalysts are more acidic than BEA ones. The EFAL species associated with Ni and Pt (or both) creates Lewis acid sites, possessing high acidity. Brønsted acid sites are also present on these samples, but with a medium strength. The total acidity measured by pyridine adsorption and TPD of ammonia reveals that Ptβ is less acidic than the other catalysts. The latter sample contains a reduced number of Brønsted acid sites, probably due to the charge compensation effect of the Pt and EFAL species, as observed in another study
[35]
, and because the acid sites of Ptβ are located in the pore mouth of BEA structure. There are no clear correlations between acidity and analysis of the influence of the metals present on the supports.
The TPR results (
Fig. 2
) show the reduction of stabilized Ni2+ and PtOx species located inside the mesopores of the zeolite supports. These species strongly interact with the zeolite structure in order to form less reducible species, as in the case of bimetallic samples. One-step reduction is observed on the platinum-containing monometallic BEA carrier (Ptβ), which is attributed to the easy reduction of well-dispersed platinum. However, the platinum-containing FAU type Y sample (PtY) has two stages of reduction due to the difficult to access location of the PtOx species on the hexagonal prisms of FAU type Y zeolite. This fact was also confirmed by the XPS (
Table 2
) of the reduced samples.
The XPS results show that the metal/Si atomic ratios are lower than those of the bulk metal/Si ratios determined from the XRF analysis, and confirm that nickel and platinum are partly distributed within the pore network of the zeolites. Indeed, the textural parameter values of the solids decrease upon dealumination and become remarkably low with the presence of both Ni and Pt. As a result, the dealumination process and the subsequent metal impregnation of the samples considerably increase the acidity and also improve the accessibility of the solids (
Table 3
,
Table 4
).
Catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane (
Fig. 4
) shows that NiY and Niβ are inactive in the reaction due to the low content of the metal (1 wt%), which also promotes the growth of deactivating carbonaceous deposits on Ni particles. However, with the addition of Pt to obtain a bimetallic catalyst, methane conversion was observed with rates similar to with Pt catalysts (Ptβ), the most active studied in this work.
XPS and TG studies of spent catalysts clearly show that deactivation occurs via deposition of deactivating coke (whisker-like carbon species) on the surface of NiY, PtY, and Niβ monometallic solids. The deposition of the filamentous carbon species may be favoured by the high acidity of these solids.
The mechanistic investigations
[44]
reveal that the dispersion of carbon during the dry reforming of methane is the result of a number of adsorption and elementary chemical steps. First, methane cracking and Boudouard reactions (reactions
(VIII)
and

) produce surface carbon on the Ni particles embedded in the support. Second, the diffusion of carbon through the Ni particles occurs, followed by segregation at the rear. Finally, the Ni particle is lifted from the support by a growing carbon filament.
Based on the mechanistic considerations mentioned above, it is inferred that the type and the nature of coke formed on NiY and Niβ samples depends exclusively on the nature of the metal and, to a lesser extent, on the carrier, meaning that the carbon growth on the solid's surface is favoured mainly by the presence of nickel. Indeed, as nickel is placed on the top, it is difficult to regenerate the catalytic system because the contact between the metal and the carrier is lost. Thus, the combined effect of the carbon growth induced by the nickel particles and the high acidity provided by dealumination of the carriers could explain the lack of activity of the NiY and Niβ catalysts.
The activity of bimetallic catalysts can also be explained by the fact that the presence of a second metal such as platinum exposes the nickel to the reactants, meaning a redispersion of Ni occurs due to the addition/dispersion of a second metal, e.g., platinum
[5]
. The reaction rates measured on the bimetallic NiPtβ sample were remarkably higher than the sum of the rates of the corresponding PtY and Ni-containing monometallic samples; thus, an additive effect cannot explain the increase in activity.
The effect of nickel addition is much less evident on FAU type Y bimetallic supported samples. NiPtY has the strongest acid sites among the catalysts studied; therefore, it justifies the large amount of deactivating filamentous amorphous coke formation on this solid. It thus has the worst catalytic performance, compared with the NiPtβ sample, in the dry reforming of methane.
To examine the contribution of each kind of carbon to the deactivation of Ni-containing catalysts during methane reforming, the findings stated that graphite-like carbon favours the close contact of carbon and Ni particles. Therefore, it plays the interesting role of CHx collector by reducing the residence time of carbon on the Ni metal surface. These atomic carbon species are relatively labile and can diffuse into Ni particles, thereby forming refractory Ni carbides
[45]
. This slows the deactivation process, even if carbon is deposited.
In addition, in the case of Ni–Pt bimetallic systems, the rate of decomposition of methane is slower than that on monometallic nickel systems. This is explained by the large lability of the type of carbon species formed on the bimetallic samples. During the reaction, the steps of deactivation are reversed: Ni–Pt metals can dissolve the inactive carbon residues and generate carbon filaments with the nickel particle on the filament top. During this process, the metallic sites remain uncovered despite the deposition of large amounts of carbon. This results in much lower deactivation rates than those expected if the metal covering coke deposits occurred
[46]
. Therefore, this can justify the activity of NiPtβ in comparison with the other catalysts.
Eventually, the dissolution of these filamentous carbon species leads to carbon whisker growth that can inhibit the catalytic efficiency by destroying the structural integrity of the catalyst and ultimately plugging the reactor, as observed in catalysts for the steam reforming of methane
[45]
. Thus, the nature of graphitic carbon, referred to as “active coke” on the Ptβ and NiPtβ samples, explains the catalytic performance of the solids.
Upon comparing the monometallic Pt-containing samples, it can be seen that there is no clear correlation to explain the catalytic stability. On one hand, Pt in monometallic samples increases the activity by avoiding the formation of deactivating coke on Ptβ. On the other hand, the acidity of PtY favours the fast deactivation of this solid due to the difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers. Nevertheless, the improved accessibility and high stability of the BEA support provided the best catalytic activity and stability when using this solid.
The lower deactivation levels observed in Ptβ (
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
) compared with NiPtβ are explained by the fact that there is a balance between carbon formation and its oxidation by CO2 at the perimeter of the metal support interface on Ptβ. This is because coke is more reactive towards CO2 in Pt systems possessing moderate acidity
[47]
. In addition, the low catalytic stability obtained over NiPtβ compared with Ptβ is due to EFAL species that produce high acidity and coke formation in zeolite pores or on the surface of the former, as shown by the X-ray fluorescence, XPS, and SEM results.
Apart from these results, it is seen that catalytic activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane is enhanced by using a dealuminated zeolite support with a moderate acidity such as a BEA carrier. This can give a more open structure of the solid, providing higher dispersion of the metal, e.g., platinum, which interacts with the support inside the zeolite pore. As a consequence, the metal is not leached during the reaction and coking is difficult and/or diminished.
Furthermore, the stability of the Ptβ catalyst is greatly superior to that of Pt/active carbon and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts after 24 h on stream (
Fig. 8
). For Pt/Al2O3, the γ-Al2O3 support is thermally unstable
[47]
at temperatures higher than 600 °C, and its high acidity promotes carbon whisker formation that expands the catalyst bed, resulting in severe operational problems. In addition, Pt/active carbon is subjected to rigorous deactivation due to the extensive support consumption by CO2 in less than 24 h on stream. In the case of the other catalysts studied, inefficient removal of carbonaceous species accumulated on the metals sites as a result of weak CO2 adsorption and/or a disproportion of CO over the metallic site is responsible for the low stability of these materials, besides the high acidity of the carriers. It was also found that Ptβ has very good potential for the dry reforming of methane applications due to its stability and resistance to coke formation.
5. Conclusions
Considering the results of the characterizations and catalytic activity, the following conclusions can be outlined from this study:
(i)
Dealumination by steaming of FAU type Y and BEA zeolites formed mesopores. Subsequent impregnation of Pt and Ni produced catalysts in which the metals were highly dispersed in those mesopores. This process considerably increased the acidity and also improved the accessibility of the catalysts.
(ii)
The catalytic performance in the CO2 reforming of methane showed that Ni-containing monometallic samples were inactive in the reaction due to the large amount of filamentous amorphous carbon deposited on these solids. Activity results on the bimetallic Ni–Pt systems were higher than those of PtY monometallic catalysts, attributable to the favourable adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site (together with Pt), which reacts with the surface filamentous carbon deposits.
(iii)
The improvement of the accessibility as well as the high stability of the BEA support gave better catalytic activity when using this solid. In contrast, low catalytic activity was obtained by using FAU type Y support due to its high acidity, which is conducive to forming difficult to eliminate carbon whiskers. Pt-containing BEA zeolite carriers have a superior activity and stability in the dry reforming of methane, compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/active carbon and other catalysts studied, due to its high resistance to coking.
