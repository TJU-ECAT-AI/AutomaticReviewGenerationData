Adsorption properties of CO on low-index Pt3Sn surfaces
Abstract
The adsorption properties of CO on Pt3Sn were investigated by utilizing quantum mechanical calculations. The (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces of Pt3Sn were generated with all possible bulk terminations, and on these terminations all types of active sites were determined. The adsorption energies and the geometries of the CO molecule at those sites were found. Those results were compared with the results obtained from the adsorption of CO on similar sites of Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(0 0 1) surfaces. The comparison reveals that adsorption of CO is stronger on Pt surfaces; this may be the reason why catalysts with Pt3Sn phase do not suffer from CO posioning in experimental works. Aiming to understand the interactions between CO and the metal adsorption sites in detail, the local density of states (LDOS) profiles were produced for atop-Pt adsorption, both for the carbon end of CO for its adsorbed and free states, and for the Pt atom of the binding site. LDOS profiles of C of free and adsorbed CO and Pt for corresponding pure Pt surfaces, Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(0 0 1) were also obtained. The comparison of the LDOS profiles of Pt atoms of atop adsorption sites on the same faces of bare Pt3Sn and Pt surfaces showed the effect of alloying with Sn on the electronic properties of Pt atoms. Comparison of LDOS profiles of the C end of CO in its free and atop adsorbed states on Pt3Sn and LDOS of Pt on bare and CO adsorbed Pt3Sn surface were used to clear out the electronic changes occurred on CO and Pt upon adsorption. The study showed that (i) inclusion of a Sn atom at the adsorption site structure causes dramatic decrease in stability which limits the number of possible CO adsorption sites on Pt3Sn surface, (ii) the presence of Sn causes angles different from 180° for M–C–O orientation, (iii) the presence of Sn in the neighborhood of Pt on which CO is adsorbed causes superposition of the 5σ/1π derived-state peaks at the carbon end of CO and changes in adsorption energy of CO, (iv) Sn present beneath the adsorption site strengthens the CO adsorption, whereas neighboring Sn on the surface weakens it for all Pt3Sn surfaces tested and (v) the most stable site for CO adsorption is the atop-Pt site of the mixed atom termination of Pt3Sn(1 1 0).
1. Introduction
The stringent environmental regulations and economic feasibility considerations impose design of catalysts having superior activity, selectivity and stability. To reach this aggressive target, a widely accepted way is to start the design from molecular level
[1]
, which needs detailed information on the properties of the possible active sites and their interactions with the reactants as well as with possible reaction intermediates. Molecular details, like changes in the electronic structure of adsorbate/adsorbent, organization of the surfaces upon adsorption, etc., require site by site understanding via utilizing quantum codes on powerful computers
[2]
.
CO oxidation has been of great interest in catalysis. Recently, preferential CO oxidation in H2-rich streams (PROX) has become crucially important in the efficient use of fuel processor-fuel cell systems, considering the pure hydrogen need of the fuel cell anode. Experimental studies showed that (i) the active site properties of a catalyst determine its performance and (ii) the structure of the support as well as of the active site can be tailored, when a support that has a modifiable surface chemistry, like activated carbon (AC), is used
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. Recent studies on AC supported Pt–Sn showed that the presence of Pt–Sn alloys, especially Pt3Sn, drastically changes the activity and stability characteristics of the catalyst in CO oxidation for both H2-free and H2-rich streams. Those studies also indicated that the formation and abundance of the Pt3Sn alloy as well as the ratio of the Pt sites to that of the alloy sites can be tailored via changing the type and amount of oxygen bearing surface groups of the AC support used. Additionally, considering the fact that the anode of fuel cells is Pt-coated carbon and it suffers from CO poisoning when hydrogen feed contains CO impurity concentration greater than 4 ppm, understanding CO–Pt3Sn interaction may lead a way to the design and development of a new anode made up of carbon coated with Pt3Sn. The modification of carbon support may also be optimized in order to obtain a Pt3Sn surface that has both superior electrochemical properties as well as long term stability.

. A DFT study on CO and atomic oxygen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) showed that the CO adsorption energies of the high symmetry sites on this surface are quite close
[6]
. It was found that when CO adsorption was studied on O-precovered surface, the most favorable CO adsorption site was found as the Pt-atop. Ge and King studied CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 0) surface and calculated the potential energy surface (PES) along
. The results indicated an existence of an energy barrier of about 0.15 eV between atop and bridge sites
[7]
. One of the few studies carried out on CO adsorption on defect sites is by Hammer et al.
[8]
. The results showed extremely strong structure sensitivity of adsorption and this was explained by a model for the d-band center of Pt. Though the computational studies are useful in understanding the CO-surface interaction, it should be kept in mind that some discrepencies may arise between experimental and theoretical results. For example, Feibelman et al. showed that there are discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results for CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) surface
[11]
. The preferred adsorption site within DFT is the hollow site whereas experimental studies showed that atop site is favored. Grinberg et al. showed that the discrepancies between the experimental and computational results are due to GGA treating different bond orders with varying accuracy and this is not only a problem for Pt surface but also on many other transition metal surfaces
[12]
. In another work, Gil et al.
[13]
studied site preference of CO on Pt(1 1 1) and how the calculated adsorption energy changes with the models/parameters are used during the calculations.
Theoretical studies were also performed on alloy surfaces. The studies on Pt-alloy surfaces and Pt–M clusters (M = Ru, Sn, Ge) by relativistic DF self consistent field Xα method showed that M atom weakens Pt–C bond and thus increases CO tolerance of the surface
[14]
. Zhang et al. investigated alloying effects on the bonding sites of Cu3Pt(1 1 1). It was found that on this alloy surface CO preferentially adsorbs on an atop-Pt site and O on an fcc-hollow site of three Pt atoms. Moreover, comparison of the results to those obtained from Pt(1 1 1) and Cu(1 1 1) showed that the adsorption energies of CO and O on their favorable sites are less on the alloy surface than are on the pure metals
[9]
. CO and OH adsorption were studied by Shubina and Koper on Pt–Ru, Pt–Mo and Pt–Sn alloys; results on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) showed that CO binds only to Pt and not to Sn, whereas OH (the oxygen precursor) has an energetic preference for the Sn sites. It should be noted that there CO was always kept perpendicular to the alloy surface during the DFT calculations
[15]
. Liu et al. studied CO adsorption on PtSn alloy
[16]
and compared the theoretically calculated adsorption energy values with those found on monometallic Pt. It was shown in a very recent study on CO–Pt3Sn(1 0 2) system by our group that CO adsorption is strongly affected by the terrace structure of the surface
[17]
.
Though there are many theoretical CO adsorption studies, none of them covers a one-to-one comparison of the possible adsorption sites on all faces and terminations of Pt3Sn surfaces. To make this kind of a comparison, it is necessary to apply systematically the same assumptions in all simulations. In this study, the adsorption properties of CO on experimentally verified stable surfaces of Pt3Sn, namely Pt3Sn (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1)
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]

[22]
, were investigated utilizing quantum mechanical calculations. The experimental studies showed that the order and composition of those Pt3Sn surface terminations are essentially bulklike. 3D models of (1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces were generated with all possible bulk terminations and CO adsorption properties were determined for all possible adsorption sites on these surfaces. Throughout the paper, “stable adsorption” is used to indicate an adsorbed CO molecule staying at the adsorption site; on the other hand, when a CO molecule moves from an adsorption site to the closest neighboring site, the term “unstable adsorption” is used. Besides the energy of adsorption, the position and the geometry of the adsorbed CO molecule were found for each adsorption site to determine whether the adsorption is stable. Aiming to determine the relative strengths of CO adsorption at the stable adsorption sites – which show CO adsorption preferences – the adsorption energies were also calculated. In the simulations no restriction was imposed on CO molecular geometry. The same QM simulations were also performed for CO adsorption on monometallic Pt surfaces, i.e. Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(0 0 1). The adsorption energies for the Pt3Sn sites on which CO is stably adsorbed were compared with the adsorption energies of the similar sites of the corresponding monometallic Pt surfaces.
Aiming to understand the details of the interactions between CO and the metal adsorption sites, the local density of states (LDOS) at the carbon end of CO and at the binding Pt atom were evaluated for Pt-atop adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces. They were compared with the LDOS of: (a) the C of CO in its free state and the binding Pt on the corresponding isolated alloy surface, aiming to understand the energetic and mechanistic details of CO adsorption, (b) the C of CO and the binding Pt on Pt(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces, respectively, to see the effect of alloying with Sn on the CO adsorption properties. Effect of alloying on properties of bare surfaces and details of bridge type CO adsorption on Pt3Sn were also studied.
2. Calculations
2.1. Construction of the Pt and Pt3Sn surfaces and parameters used in the QM simulation of CO adsorption
The exact length of the C–O bond in free CO molecule has been obtained by a geometry optimization with DMol3 software package in Materials Studio of Accelrys Inc. Spin unrestricted DFT calculations were performed. Local density approximation (LDA) is employed with the VWN (Vosko–Wilk–Nusair) functional. The basis set is the DND (double numerical plus d-functions). The wave functions are confined within a cutoff radius of 5.5 Å. The electron density is approximated using a multipolar expansion.
Pt3Sn alloy crystallizes in the L12 structure
[23]
, and the bulk lattice constant has been determined as 4.00 Å
[19]
. The structure of the bulk Pt3Sn was then optimized by CASTEP of Accelrys Inc. The parameters used in energy optimization, of both the bare surface and the adsoption system, were as follows: The exchange-correlation energy and the potential were described by the GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) along with the PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) functional. Ionic cores were described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials and the Kohn-Sham one-electron states were expanded in a plane-wave basis set up to 300 eV. The k-point sampling set applied was 3 × 4 × 1 for all surface terminations. No spin-polarization effects were included in the exchange-correlation functional.
Pulay’s density mixing scheme was used for the SCF electronic minimization. A smearing range of 0.1 eV was applied at the Fermi level and 4 empty bands were introduced to speed up the convergence. The energy was corrected by extrapolation to zero temperature
[24]
.
A comparison of the results obtained from the calculations with 3-layer and 4-layer slabs for the CO–Pt3Sn(1 1 1) system indicated that the 3-layer slab has provided sufficiently accurate results; this is in agreement with the results of a previous adsorption study on oxygen adsorption on the Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface
[25]
. Additionally, convergence tests run for the selected sites, namely top and bridge sites on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 0), showed that changing k-point from (3 × 4 × 1) to (7 × 7 × 1) results in a change of adsorption energy less than 0.04 eV and changing cutoff energy from 300 eV to 380 eV lead to a change in adsorption energy less than 0.17 eV. It should be also noted that the accuracy of the CO site preferences obtained with 300 eV cutoff energy and 3 × 4 × 1 k-sampling values were confirmed for selected sites using a cutoff energy value of 380 eV and k-point sampling of 7 × 7 × 1.
Two important points were taken into consideration: (i) the cell should be wide enough, so that the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction is minimum, (ii) the slab should include a sufficiently thick vacuum layer above the adsorbate and the surface, so that the adsorbate molecule is not attracted by both the topside and the underside of the surface. The layer thickness values of the Pt3Sn(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces were found as 2.318 Å, 1.419 Å and 2.007 Å, respectively. The vacuum thicknesses in the slabs of these surfaces were selected as 4, 6 and 4-equivalent layers, respectively, so as to account for a vacuum thickness approximately equal in each system. The slabs were generated according to the methods described elsewhere
[25]
.
Several types of twofold, threefold and fourfold sites exist on the Pt3Sn surfaces, depending on the positions of atoms in the second layer, e.g. threefold site with fcc or hcp configuration
[25]
. All possible sites for the three surfaces were determined in order to calculate and to compare the CO adsorption energies.

The Cartesian positions of the bottom layers were fixed to speed up the calculations while the top metal layer was allowed to relax along with the adsorbent. The adsorption energy and the geometry of each site were obtained by geometry optimization using CASTEP. To start a simulation, CO was placed at the specified site, carbon bound to the surface atom(s) and oxygen bound to the carbon. Another important issue is the choice of initial values for the Pt–C bond lengths prior to optimization. Since no data has yet been reported in literature for Pt3Sn surfaces, data from CO adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) has been used
[6]
. The C–O bond length was calculated by geometry optimization using DMol3, and was used as the initial value in all calculations.
The simulations on monometallic Pt surfaces were generated following the same procedure described above for Pt3Sn surfaces. The bulk lattice constant has been taken as 3.92 Å
[6]
. The layer thickness values of the Pt(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces were found as 2.265 Å, 1.387 Å and 1.962 Å, respectively. The vacuum distances in the slabs of these surfaces were selected as 4, 6 and 4-equivalent layers, respectively.

where Eads is the adsorption energy of CO at that site, Esystem is the energy of the optimized adsorption complex, ECO is the energy of the optimized CO molecule and Esurface is the energy of the optimized bare surface.
2.2. Construction of LDOS profiles
In order to gain more insight into the electronic mechanism of CO adsorption, the key should be a comparison-based evaluation of the electronic states. Essential qualitative information is provided by the LDOS (local density of states) charts of the bonding atoms.
The LDOS of an atom in a system shows the atom’s contribution to the electronic states of the system in various parts of the energy spectrum, without resolving these contributions according to the angular momenta of the states (i.e. identifying the s, p, d and f characters). CASTEP module was used to generate the LDOS charts
[24]
. CASTEP uses a simplified linear interpolation scheme developed by Ackland (1998). This method is based on linear interpolation in paralelopipeds formed by the points of the Monkhorst–Pack set, followed by the histogram sampling of the resultant set of band energies. Smearing method is employed with a width of 0.2 eV. Charts are produced by plotting the LDOS data (electrons/eV) versus energy (eV)
[24]
.
The LDOS at the C end of CO and at the binding Pt atom were obtained for Pt-on top adsorption on all terminations of Pt3Sn(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces. The LDOS figure of each atom was compared on the same chart with the LDOS figure of the same atom in the isolated or bare state; for C, it is the free CO molecule; and for Pt, Pt atom on the adsorbing site of the corresponding bare alloy surface. The isolated state of CO was created by approximating it to an empty slab of the same size as the adsorption system, and placing the CO in the slab. Keeping the C–O bond at 1.34 Å, the exact value for the relaxed molecule, a single-point-energy (SPE) calculation was carried out by CASTEP to obtain the LDOS data. The isolated state of an alloy surface was, on the other hand, represented by the optimized geometry of the corresponding bare slab. The LDOS data was extracted from the bare slab optimization that was carried out for calculation of the Pt-on top adsorption energy, named as Esurface in Eq.
(1)
.
LDOS profiles were used to analyze (i) the electronic properties of Pt atoms on bare Pt3Sn and Pt surfaces and the effect of alloying on the electronic properties of the bare Pt atoms, (ii) the effect of alloying on CO adsorption through comparing LDOS of binding atoms on each Pt3Sn surface and the same atoms on a Pt surface of the same geometry, and (iii) the changes occurred in the electronic properties of the C-end of the CO adsorbed atop on both Pt and Pt3Sn surfaces.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Clean surface models
The bulk lattice constant of Pt3Sn was calculated as 4.0148 Å, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 4.00 Å
[19]
.
The (1 × 1) slab representing the (1 1 1) surface consists of 12 atoms; with a single Sn atom in each layer. The layers being identical lead to a single type of bulk-termination. The other surfaces on the other hand have two possible bulk-terminations, one consisting of only Pt atoms (“pure-Pt ending”), the other including both Pt and Sn (“mixed atom ending”). The (1 × 1) slabs of both (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces consist of 6 atoms, representing the mixed layers by one Pt and one Sn.
The same procedure was applied for the construction of the Pt surfaces. The bulk lattice constant of Pt is obtained as 3.924 Å.
3.2. CO adsorption
Previous experimental and computational work on CO adsorption has verified that CO interacts preferentially with Pt (or with as few Sn surface atoms as possible)
[15]
, but does not bind to the surface Sn atoms in a Pt–Sn cluster. Taking this as a starting point, the binding site preferences of the CO molecule were investigated for all possible Pt3Sn(1 1 1), (1 1 0) and (0 0 1) surfaces having different terminations (

,

,

,

). CO adsorption energies and geometry of the adsorbed molecule and the surface were also found for all possible adsorption sites on corresponding monometallic Pt surface, i.e. Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(0 0 1), aiming to have a comparison basis (

a–c,

). For each adsorption site the slabs representing the bare surface and the adsorption complex have been optimized, and their energy values (Esurface and Esystem, respectively) were found.

During geometry optimization both the top layer of the metal surface and the adsorbate molecule are relaxed and they reach a minimum energy configuration. Through the optimization studies it was found that at some adsorption sites on the Pt3Sn surface the CO molecule deviated significantly from the site region investigated. As an example, how CO adsorbed at a fourfold hollow site J of the mixed terminated Pt3Sn(1 1 0) moves upon adsorption to its equilibrium structure is given in

. The site is comprised of two Pt and two Sn atoms with a Pt atom in the second layer (top view).

Fig. 5. CO adsorption at site J. The arrow indicates the reorientation of the CO molecule during optimization (●: Sn; ○: Pt).
As can be seen from the optimized geometry, the adsorbed CO molecule has moved significantly towards the Pt atoms and away from the Sn atoms; thereby approaching to the nearest stable (i.e. a long-bridge) position. The fourfold hollow site is clearly a site for unstable CO adsorption. The other unstable adsorption sites on the three Pt3Sn surfaces are marked with (∗) in
Table 4a
. As seen form the simulation results, all of the sites including Sn atoms have proved unstable. This result is in agreement with the literature

Based on the determined stable geometries, the order of site preferences of CO was investigated in terms of the calculated adsorption energies for both Pt3Sn and Pt surfaces.
3.2.1. Pt3Sn (1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
The differences in binding energies of CO at different sites of Pt3Sn(1 1 1) (
Fig. 1
) are small, i.e. 0.64 eV maximum, suggesting a relatively flat potential energy surface (PES) and easy diffusion across the Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface (
Table 4a
).
To clear out the effect of Sn on a solid comparison basis, CO adsorption was also studied on Pt(1 1 1) with the same assumptions as used for Pt3Sn(1 1 1). The CO adsorption energy values at the adsorption sites of the pure Pt surfaces are given in
Table 4b
. Geometries for which site-by-site comparison is possible between the two surfaces are given in
Table 5
, along with their adsorption energies. The CO adsorption sites on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) are given in
Fig. 1
,
Fig. 4
a, respectively. The comparison of the adsorption strengths for similar sites were made for the same CO surface coverages.
The adsorption energies given in
Table 5
belong to similar adsorption sites of Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surfaces. The −1.78 eV and −1.60 eV adsorption energies for Pt-atop adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1), respectively, show that the presence of Sn in the alloy structure leads to a decrease in the CO adsorption strength of Pt-atop adsorption. The details regarding the effect of Sn are discussed for selected examples in Section
3.3.3
.
Parallel to the Pt-atop adsorption, the weakening effect of neighboring Sn atoms is also valid for bridge (B) and hcp site of Pt3Sn(1 1 1), site C (
Table 5
). It should be noted that the LDOS of C atoms of adsorbed CO in bridge form on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1) clearly shows the enhanced electron density approximately −10 eV, which is 4σ-like orbital of C atom, when CO is adsorbed on the atop-Pt site of Pt3Sn(1 1 1) (see Section
3.3.2
).
The negative effect of the neighboring Sn atoms on CO adsorption strength when they are present at the same plane is even more clear for the fcc site at the upmost layer (G); the difference in Eads between Pt(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(1 1 1) reaches approximately 0.60 eV (
Table 5
).
Among the stable CO adsorption sites on Pt3Sn(1 1 1), C (the hcp hollow site with three Pt atoms; the second layer atom at the hollow is a Sn) is energetically the most favored, with CO adsorption energy of −1.987 eV. The secondly preferred one is the bridge site B with two Pt atoms and an Sn at the bottom. They show the strengthening effect of Sn beneath on CO adsorption when Pt3Sn sites are considered. The difference in the energies of the two bridge sites B and E is worth considering: altering the Pt at the bottom with an Sn results in a significant CO adsorption preference of 0.539 eV for site B. Being able to detect the effect of second layer atom thereby, we could state that the same kind of reasoning holds also for site C; due to the presence of the Sn atom, site C is much more favorable than site G of fcc hollow configuration with three Pt’s (
Table 4a
). The fcc structure has a much more hollow character than the hcp; however, the three Pt atoms in the second layer make CO adsorption difficult. The third layer Sn atom in the middle of the hollow at site G though increases the overall affinity for CO.
Sites D (fcc hollow with two Pt’s and one Sn) and F (hcp hollow with two Pt’s and one Sn, the second layer atom at the hollow is a Pt) are unstable due to the presence of Sn atom in the adsorption site. The CO placed at site D moves away from the Sn atom to which it is connected and reaches stability at a site C nearby (
Fig. 1
). Similar happens at site F, the CO moves toward a nearest G site. The diffusion of CO from unstable towards the stable sites on the Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface is shown in
Fig. 1
.
In literature, CO adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface is studied by Shubina and Koper, who carried out a very similar model using DFT-GGA calculations by VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package)
[15]
. Comparison of our results with those of their study shows that the order of the site preferences for CO is the same, with an average of 12% difference in binding energies (eV); for example, energies of CO adsorption for Pt atop, Pt–Pt bridge type and hcp hollow (Pt3) were found in their study as −1.40 eV, −1.64 eV and −1.82 eV, respectively. In their study, Shubina and Koper imposed perpendicular geometry for adsorbed CO molecule. It is well known from the experimental studies that CO adsorbed on flat Pt surfaces is perpendicular to the surface and imposing perpendicular geometry for adsorbed CO is surely correct for the theoretical adsorption studies on flat Pt surfaces. On the other hand, there is no experimental evidence for perpendicular geometry of adsorbed CO on alloy surfaces, like Pt3Sn. Thus, the fixed perpendicular geometry imposed on adsorbed CO by Shubina and Koper may be partly responsible for the difference between the adsorption strengths found in our study and theirs. In the current study, the discussion on the stability of CO at the adsorption sites, CO site preference(s) and CO surface diffusion was made considering both the adsorption energy values and the equilibrium geometry of CO on the surface, which was obtained without any geometric restriction.
There is also a slight modification in CO orientation bound to the E site upon relaxation, though adsorption was considered as stable (
Fig. 6
): Owing to the neighboring Sn atom, the CO at site E bends slightly toward the site G on the opposite site (
Fig. 1
,
Fig. 6
). This is an example, which shows that the assumption of perpendicular CO orientation by Shubina and Koper
[15]
may not be a valid assumption when CO adsorption on alloy surfaces is studied.

Fig. 6. Orientation of CO at the bridge site E of the Pt3Sn(1 1 1) surface. The geometry of adsorbed CO at the site E is an example which shows that perpendicular geometry restriction applied to CO in previous studies was an oversimplication (●: Sn; ○: Pt).
In our study, CO–Pt(1 1 1) system is used as the comparison basis. The experimental CO adsorption energy reported in literature is approximately −1.60 eV for atop CO adsorption
[15]
, which is close to the calculated value in our study. Our values for CO–Pt(1 1 1) are very close to the ones reported previously
[6]
. In literature, energies for atop, hcp and fcc type CO adsorption were calculated for cluster model with different functionals and slab model
[13]
. The values reported for cluster model calculated by using VASP having PW91 functional are in accordance with our results whereas the reported CO adsorption values calculated indicate weaker adsorption compared to our data. In another study, atop Pt adsorption strength was reported as −1.39 eV
[16]
, which is weaker than both some experimentally found values and that in our study. (Note that in
[16]
, −1.43 eV is taken as the reference experimental value.)
3.2.2. Pt3Sn (1 1 0) and Pt(1 1 0) surfaces
Although there are two possible terminations for Pt3Sn(1 1 0) (
Fig. 2
a and b), the mixed atom termination is the thermodynamic equilibrium structure. However, both the mixed and the pure-Pt terminations were investigated considering the fact that both may appear in the agglomerates formed on the surface of a real catalyst. Interestingly, the results showed that the pure-Pt termination would be much more favorable for CO adsorption than the mixed termination (
Table 4a
). In fact, it would have the lowest CO adsorption energy values among all the Pt3Sn surfaces studied.
The Pt–Sn termination has two stable sites for CO adsorption: Energetically the most favorable one is the atop site H, with adsorption energy of −1.517 eV, followed by the long bridge site I with −1.013 eV (
Table 4a
;
Fig. 2
a). The 4.015 Å Pt–Pt distance of site I on the relaxed clean surface decreases to 3.659 Å upon adsorption. The geometries of the sites H and I are purely symmetric; therefore no tilting of the Pt–C or C–O bonds observed in equilibrium geometry of adsorbed CO. Site J is unstable due to the presence of Sn atoms. When relaxed, CO moves away from the Sn atoms toward the Pt’s and reaches stability at a nearest long-bridge (I) site (
Fig. 2
a).
The most favorable site of pure-Pt (
Fig. 2
b) termination is the atop site (K), with adsorption energy of −2.294 eV (
Table 4a
). This site is energetically the most favorable of all the sites studied. The short bridge site L follows it with −2.208 eV. The short bridge Pt–Pt distance is 2.839 Å, and it decreases slightly to 2.799 Å upon CO adsorption. In the long bridge site M, on the other hand, distance between Pt atoms at the site decreases from 4.015 Å to 3.659 Å. The significant preference of CO for the short bridge site over the long bridge can be explained by the larger hollow volume at site L due to the 90° difference in site orientations.
The pure-Pt termination has two fourfold hollow sites, N and O, which differ in their second layer atoms (
Fig. 2
b). These are the only unstable sites though there is no Sn atom present bound to carbon. At these sites the CO molecule is destabilized due to the presence of highly strong adsorption sites, K and M. In addition, the four-Pt atoms are not close to each other (as in the sites T and U of the pure-terminated Pt3Sn(0 0 1)) and asymmetric spaces formed between the Pt’s along y- and z-directions add up to the unstable character (
Table 4a
and
Fig. 2
b). A CO molecule adsorbed at site N diffuses to a nearest atop site K, whereas one at site O moves to a neighboring long-bridge site M (
Fig. 2
b).
The comparison of CO adsorption strength at short bridge type adsorption sites, L and P, clearly indicate the strengthening effect of Sn beneath on CO adsorption; the Sn atoms present in the second layer positioned orthogonal to adsorbed CO for site P increased the adsorption strength by approximately 0.20 eV (
Table 4a
and
Fig. 2
b).
It should be noted that Pt3Sn (1 1 0) sites for mixed ending termination are very weak CO adsorption sites compared to that on Pt (1 1 0) sites due to Sn presence at the top layer. On the other hand, since Sn atoms present beneath strengthens the CO adsorption for Pt3Sn (1 1 0) pure-Pt termination sites, the CO adsorption energy differences between atop site K and atop site E on Pt(1 1 0) is lower than 0.04 eV (
Table 4a
,
Table 4b
,
Table 6
). The situation is similar for the CO adsorption energy difference of bridge site on Pt3Sn (1 1 0), site P, which positioned orthogonal to Sn atoms beneath, and bridge site F on Pt (1 1 0): the difference is less than 0.11 eV (
Table 4a
,
Table 4b
,
Table 6
).
3.2.3. Pt3Sn (0 0 1) and Pt(0 0 1) surfaces
Having a simple looking structure, the mixed termination has a single stable site: atop (Q) (
Fig. 3
a and
Table 4a
). This site is also the most favorable of Pt3Sn(0 0 1) with adsorption energy of −2.045 eV. The fourfold hollow site (R) comprised of two Pt and two Sn atoms on a second layer Pt has proven unstable (
Fig. 3
a). Presence of Sn at the hollow site is an indication of instability for CO adsorption. The two Sn atoms induce strong instability on the CO molecule, which cannot be balanced by the two Pt’s at the site. The diagonal bridge site V is the strongest adsorption site on Pt3Sn (0 0 1) with pure Pt-termination with adsorption energy of −1.946 eV (
Fig. 3
b and
Table 4a
). This strong adsorption is led by the electronic interaction of the Pt atoms of the site with Sn atoms in the second layer.
The pure-Pt termination has five stable sites (
Fig. 3
b). The fourfold hollow site with a second layer Pt atom, T, has adsorption energy of −1.734 eV at a coverage of 0.25. When the surface mesh is doubled in order to avoid the bonding competition between adjacent CO molecules, the adsorption strength increases with an adsorption energy of −1.812 eV (
Table 4a
). The strong CO adsorption on site T can be explained by the electronic interaction between the Pt atoms at the site and the neighboring Sn atoms underneath. On the other hand, the beneficial interaction between Pt’s of site U and the single Sn atom beneath at the center of the hollow is rather limited compared to that for site T. In addition, the Pt atoms surrounding the hollow are close to each other, forming a nest-like structure for the adsorbate (
Fig. 3
b). Following site T, atop site S has CO adsorption energy of −1.655 eV; and the fourfold hollow site U with a Sn at the second layer has CO adsorption energy of −1.337 eV at a coverage of 0.125. When CO coverage is increased to 0.25, site U becomes unstable for CO adsorption (
Table 4a
). It should be noted that the Pt–C and C–O bond lengths do not follow the expected decreasing pattern with decreasing adsorption energy values. The Pt–C–O angle is kept nearly at 180° in all stable sites.
A comparison through the CO adsorption strength on the stable CO adsorption sites of Pt3Sn (0 0 1) for both terminations and that on similar Pt(0 0 1) sites clearly shows that Pt surface adsorbs CO more strongly (
Table 4a
,
Table 4b
).
3.3. The electronic mechanism of CO adsorption
The conventional model for CO adsorption, which involves the synergism between 5σ charge donation from CO states to metal states and 2π back donation from metal states to CO states, is too simplistic. The oversimplification comes from the fact that in the conventional model the contribution of other orbitals, especially of 4σ, is neglected. To explain the mechanism of CO adsorption in more detail, the electronic structure of the system is examined using the Orbital Mixing Model, which envisages the overall quantum states of a chemisorption system as being formed by the mixing of discrete CO molecular orbitals with the continuum of metal d states.
In a CO–metal system the 3σ, 4σ, 1π, 5σ and 2π molecular orbitals (MO’s) of CO are essential to describe the bonding of the molecule; and these MO’s should be investigated in three groups
[26]
: (1) The 3σ orbital hardly interacts with the metal bands due to its low energy level, and is essentially not involved in chemisorption. (2) The 4σ and 1π orbitals do interact, particularly with the metal d bands, but all the levels so formed lie below the Fermi level and the net contribution to the chemisorption energy is very small. (3) The 5σ and 2π orbitals are, however, mixed sufficiently strong to produce unfilled antibonding states above the Fermi level; which therefore provide significant net bonding to the surface. Consequently, 4σ-, 1π- and 5σ-derived levels contain metal orbital character; and metal-derived levels themselves contain strong 5σ, 2π and some 4σ, 1π character. The main metal-5σ and metal-2π antibonding states are located above the Fermi level.
On the studied low-index Pt3Sn and the corresponding Pt surfaces, the LDOS profiles of free CO, C of adsorbed CO have been utilized, as well as the LDOS profiles of the bare and occupied states of Pt of those surfaces. The LDOS profiles of the selected systems are given in

. Lastly, the effect of Sn inclusion on the electronic structure of C of bridge type adsorbed CO for (1 1 1) geometry is given in
Fig. 10
. Comparison of LDOS profiles should provide insight into the contributions of each type of orbital to CO–metal bonding and into the redistribution of charge that takes place upon adsorption on each surface studied.

[6]
.
3.3.1. The LDOS profiles of carbon of free CO and Pt of bare surfaces
CO is adsorbed on metal surfaces through interaction between its carbon end and the surface metal atom, in our case, Pt. Thus, the changes in electronic densities/density of states for carbon of CO, in its free and adsorbed states, and their comparison gives insight into the electronic interaction between CO and Pt.
LDOS profiles of carbon of free CO is given in
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 8a
as a reference for comparison. There are four distinct electron-rich regions along the energy scale: the first peak at −24 eV represents the 3σ state. The peak around −10.5 eV is the 4σ state. The next two peaks at −6.5 eV and −3.5 eV belong to the 1π and 5σ states. The higher energy state of C of free CO is at +3 eV, belongs to 2π-like state. LDOS profiles of Pt atom of the bare Pt and Pt3Sn surfaces studied are given in
Fig. 7b
,
Fig. 8b
,
Fig. 9a
,
Fig. 9b
as comparison bases. Since the Pt states change according to the surface studied, there are different electron/state density for each case.
3.3.2. CO adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(0 0 1)
The electronic interactions occur during CO adsorption at atop Pt sites for all Pt3Sn surfaces were studied through comparing LDOS profiles of carbon end of CO and Pt atom for their adsorbed and isolated/bare states. Two cases, CO–Pt3Sn(1 1 1) (
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 7b
) and CO–Pt3Sn(0 0 1) (
Fig. 8a
,
Fig. 8b
) of mixed termination, are given as representative examples.
(i)
LDOS profiles of C end of CO: The LDOS curves of C of free and adsorbed CO coincide at the same energy value, −24 eV, with very little difference in amplitudes (
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 8a
). This suggests that the 3σ MO of CO is not involved in bonding with the surface; and the 3σ-derived state has uniquely CO MO character. This is also the case for CO–Pt3Sn (1 1 0) system.
The peak represents the 4σ-derived state, which is at −8.5 eV for C of free CO, is shifted downward with an increase in amplitude for both CO–Pt3Sn(1 1 1) and CO–Pt3Sn(0 0 1) cases (
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 8a
). This implies that the 4σ-MO of CO is involved in some mixing with the metal d-states. The increase in peak intensity of 4σ-derived state for both adsorption cases suggests that there exists more electron density around carbon in 4σ-derived state after chemisorption than there is around carbon in the 4σ of free CO.
The next two peaks in
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 8a
represent the 1π- and 5σ-like derived states for C of free CO. As indicated by the downward shifts and broadening of the peaks relative to the corresponding peaks in the free CO curve (at −6.5 eV and −3.5 eV, respectively), the 5σ and 1π orbitals of CO are both involved in bonding with the metal upon adsorption. The pronounced magnitudes of the shifts in the energy levels of the 1π/5σ orbitals, as well as the broadening of their peaks, indicate their strong contribution to bonding. The most significant contribution of the two comes from the 5σ molecular orbital, as its peak is shifted downwards in energy more. The peak intensities of both derived states are smaller than those of the corresponding peaks of CO orbitals; which clearly indicates that there is a decrease in electron density around carbon in the corresponding energy levels after chemisorption.
The region from −6 eV up to the Fermi level consists of quantum states that contain strong metal character and relatively weaker 5σ or 2π character. The intensity of the adsorbed carbon LDOS in this region is particularly low, indicating that the states in this range have very little electron density close to carbon (
Fig. 7a
,
Fig. 8a
). On the other hand, the 2π-derived orbitals above the Fermi level, i.e. metal-5σ and metal-2π, show significant peak broadening, especially for Pt3Sn(1 1 1) and Pt3Sn(0 0 1) of mixed atom termination, and slight downward shifts for all alloy surfaces indicate strong contribution of those states to CO bonding on Pt3Sn.
(ii)
LDOS of Pt adsorption site: In the adsorbed state, the Pt-LDOS curve is at its highest intensity in the region from −5 eV up to Fermi level, which consists of quantum states that contain strong metal character and weaker 5σ or 2π character.
Looking at
Fig. 7b
,
Fig. 8b
, distinct shifts are observed upon adsorption with respect to the clean Pt curve in this region. For both the (1 1 1) and the (0 0 1) surfaces the number of peaks in the region decrease and the peaks shift approximately 2 eV downward upon adsorption, indicating the contribution of the metal d states to bonding. Shifts are common to all Pt3Sn surfaces and are of approximately 2 eV. of the (0 0 1) surface, the shift for the mixed atom termination is accompanied by a relatively sharp increase in intensity (
Fig. 7b
).
For all Pt3Sn surfaces the Pt LDOS curve exhibits a number of small peaks of increased density upon adsorption in the region between −5 eV and −10 eV, due to the presence of 5σ- and 1π-like states. The lowest energy peak at −24 eV and the peak at about −10 eV show the existence of 3σ- and 4σ-like states, respectively. These results are consistent with the orbital mixing model
[26]
.
3.3.3. Effect of alloying
The effect of alloying of Pt with Sn is first studied for bare surfaces. The Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) is given as an example: The comparison of LDOS of Pt of bare Pt(1 1 0) and Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) clearly shows an enrichment in electronic states in the −5 to −1 eV region for Pt of the alloyed surface. On the other hand, Pt of bare Pt(1 1 0) has highest intensity around Fermi level (
Fig. 9a
). This difference reflects itself in LDOS of Pt of the surfaces Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) and Pt(1 1 0) having CO adsorbed atop (
Fig. 9b
). A comparison of the LDOS profiles indicate a higher intensity approximately −5 eV for Pt of Pt(1 1 0) as two consecutive peaks, whereas the electron density is higher from −4 eV up to the Fermi level for Pt of Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) (
Fig. 9b
). This shows that electron density of bare Pt of Pt(1 1 0) around Fermi level shifts to approximately −5 eV, led by the electronic interaction between Pt and adsorbed CO; this should be through dominantly 5σ/1π-derived states of CO. On the other hand, the interaction between Pt of Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) and adsorbed CO should be mostly through the 5σ-derived states of CO. For both cases 4σ-derived state plays a role in adsorption, indicated by electron density around −10 eV (
Fig. 9b
). A comparison of LDOS of C of adsorbed CO for atop Pt adsorption for Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination) and Pt(1 1 0) with LDOS of C of free CO (
Fig. 9c
) indicates: (i) the peaks get smaller and broadened between 0–5 eV upon adsorption on both surfaces indicating contribution of metal-5σ and metal-2π-derived orbitals in bonding; (ii) drastic shifts toward lower energy levels in 5σ/1π-derived states – these are completely merged for C of CO adsorbed on Pt3Sn(1 1 0-mixed termination); (iii) Shift in electron density to lower energy as well as magnified intensity for 4σ of C of CO adsorbed on both surfaces.
3.3.4. Bridge type CO adsorption
The bridge type CO adsorption of CO on Pt’s of the Pt3Sn and Pt surfaces has led to very different LDOS profiles of C of the adsorbed CO. This indicates that different electronic interactions play role for monometallic and alloy surfaces. The bridge type adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) and Pt(1 1 1) are given as an example (
Fig. 10
). The LDOS profiles in
Fig. 10
clearly show that: (i) For Pt(1 1 1) surface, there is a participation of 3σ-derived states in adsorption whereas their contribution is negligible for Pt3Sn(1 1 1); (ii) The 4σ-derived state contributes drastically for Pt3Sn(1 1 1) indicated by a very higher amplitude peak around approximately −10 eV for adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) case, (iii) a higher electron density between −5 and 0 eV for Pt(1 1 1) showing rather limited interaction of CO adsorbed with the Pt of alloy surface, and (iv) relatively higher electron density for C of CO between 0 and 5 eV for bridge-type CO adsorption on Pt3Sn(1 1 1) compared to that of Pt(1 1 1).
4. Conclusions
•
Quantum chemical calculations offer the opportunity to probe details of catalytic chemistry that are difficult to obtain from experiments, and they should be employed not only for understanding the mechanism in detail, but also in the screening level of catalyst design.
•
For CO/Pt3Sn adsorption system, inclusion of a Sn atom at the adsorption site structure causes dramatic decrease in stability. All such sites on the three stable Pt3Sn surfaces studied have proved unstable. The results indicate that CO molecules diffuse from the unstable sites toward the neighboring stable sites.
•
The QM studies indicate that Sn present beneath the adsorption site strengthens the CO adsorption, whereas neighboring Sn on the surface destabilizes it for all Pt3Sn surfaces tested.
•
The comparison of CO adsorption on the Pt and Pt3Sn surface sites having the same geometry showed that Sn presence in the alloy (i) limits the number of stable CO adsorption sites on the alloy surface, (ii) weakens CO adsorption.
•
The utilization of LDOS profiles in explaining CO–Pt3Sn interactions enables to understand the contributing orbitals to bonding. The effect of Sn on electronic structure of Pt can be readily discussed based on the changes in LDOS profiles of Pt. The results indicate that LDOS profiles of the bare surfaces can also be used to guess the adsorption properties of the surfaces.
