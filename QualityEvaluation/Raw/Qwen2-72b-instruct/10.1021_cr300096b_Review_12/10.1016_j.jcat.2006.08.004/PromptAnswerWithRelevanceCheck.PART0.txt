How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

1.The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that PtRu/SiO2 catalysts have been investigated for other reactions, such as CO methanation, hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane, and isomerization of 2-methylpentane. The document also discusses the effects of pretreatment conditions on the structural properties and activity of SiO2-supported bimetallic PtRu catalysts for the selective oxidation of CO. It indicates that the presence of Pt stabilizes Ru and prevents its sintering during exposure to oxidizing conditions. Furthermore, the strength of the CO adsorption on the bimetallic samples is lower than that on the monometallic counterparts, presumably due to the presence of bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ru. The use of an O2/H2 treatment increases the PtRu bimetallic interactions, and thus a lower degree of phase segregation between Pt and Ru is observed in this case. However, intraparticle segregation (i.e., segregation of the two metals within the same particle) is more pronounced after this treatment with the surface of the nanoparticles formed being substantially enriched in Pt. In contrast, significant amounts of both Pt and Ru are present on the surface of samples pretreated directly in H2. Such samples exhibit similar activity for the PROX reaction to that of monometallic Ru, since a sufficient number of Ru sites appear to be present on their surface to drive the reaction. No added benefit from the presence of Pt was observed in this case. Only a very small fraction of Ru sites was present on the surface of PtRu samples treated in O2/H2, and hence, catalytic behavior similar to that of Pt would be expected. However, the activity of such samples is substantially improved over that of Pt, most probably due to the lower strength of adsorption of CO on Pt, which can be attributed to the PtRu interactions.

1.文档没有提供关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。然而，它确实提到PtRu/SiO2催化剂已被用于其他反应的研究，如CO甲烷化、甲基环戊烷的氢解和2-甲基戊烷的异构化。文档还讨论了预处理条件对SiO2支持的双金属PtRu催化剂结构特性和活性的影响，用于CO的选择性氧化。它表明Pt的存在稳定了Ru，并在暴露于氧化条件下防止其烧结。此外，双金属样品上的CO吸附强度低于单金属对应物，这可能是由于Pt和Ru之间存在双金属相互作用。使用O2/H2处理增加了PtRu双金属相互作用，因此在这种情况下观察到Pt和Ru之间的相分离程度较低。然而，在这种处理后，颗粒内分离（即两种金属在同一颗粒内分离）更为明显，形成的纳米颗粒表面大量富集Pt。相比之下，直接在H2中预处理的样品表面存在大量Pt和Ru。这些样品在PROX反应中的活性与单金属Ru相似，因为它们的表面似乎存在足够的Ru位点来驱动反应。在这种情况下，没有观察到Pt存在带来的额外益处。在O2/H2处理的PtRu样品表面，只有非常小的Ru位点存在，因此，可以预期其催化行为类似于Pt。然而，这种样品的活性比Pt显著提高，这可能是因为CO在Pt上的吸附强度较低，这可以归因于PtRu相互作用。
