1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation at low temperatures (< 100 °C). The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the stability of various Fe-Pt structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres. The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled the derivation of the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到Fe-Pt催化剂已被用于过量H2中CO的优先氧化(PROX)，在低温(< 100 °C)下实现了大约100%的CO氧化选择性。Pt皮肤表面的独特催化性能归因于表面Pt的电子结构由下面的Fe修改，这影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。未来的UHV研究可能通过检查各种Fe-Pt结构在高温和不同反应气氛下的稳定性，提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解。各种Fe-Pt表面结构的受控制备使我们能够推导出结构与催化性能之间的关系，这将有助于设计高性能和低成本的催化剂。
