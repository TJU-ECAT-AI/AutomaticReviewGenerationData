1.The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation at low temperatures (< 100 °C). The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the stability of various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres.

1.文档没有提供关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的催化剂，如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到Fe-Pt催化剂已被用于CO在过量H2中的优先氧化(PROX)，在低温(< 100 °C)下实现了大约100%的CO氧化选择性。Pt-皮肤结构也显示出催化不饱和烃氢化的高活性。Pt-皮肤表面的独特催化性质归因于表面Pt的电子结构由下面的Fe修改，这影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。未来的UHV研究可能通过检查各种结构在高温和不同反应气氛下的稳定性，为将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联提供见解。
