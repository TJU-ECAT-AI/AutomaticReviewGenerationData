          [1] "In this section we will provide an overview of several types of reactions that utilize bimetallic catalysts: CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces."
          [2] "The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts."
          [3] "The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."
          [4] "The alloyed metal and dispersion have been found to play an important role in the activity of WGS."
          [5] "For CH4 to be used as a direct fuel, it must be fully combusted to CO2 and H2O to reduce environmental impacts, mainly because CH4 is a greenhouse gas that has an even greater global-warming potential than CO2."
          [6] "The enhanced activity of the bimetallic system can be explained by increased reducibility of Co and facilitated chain-growth by Co from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt."
          [7] "The recent discovery of large natural gas reservoirs has increased efforts in finding efficient processes to partially oxidize CH4 into CO and H2."
          [8] "The addition of Pt to the Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst also prevents deactivation by helping the alloyed Ni rereduce from Ni2+ to Ni0."

          Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been shown to significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, elucidating the detailed mechanisms of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

          基于铂的双金属催化剂已被证明在反应器研究中对一氧化碳氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率有显著影响。对于一氧化碳氧化，涉及铂和过渡金属（如铁和镍）的双金属催化剂与单金属铂催化剂相比，表现出增强的活性和选择性。界面限制效应和特定表面结构的存在，如NiO1x/PtNiPt(111)和NiO1x/Pt(111)，在增强一氧化碳氧化活性中起着关键作用。在水煤气变换反应中，向基于铂的催化剂中添加如铼、钴和金等金属会导致更高的活性，分散性和合金化金属的性质是关键因素。对于甲烷转化，像PtCo和PtNi这样的双金属催化剂显示出更高的C2+产物转化率和对CO和H2的改进选择性。增强的活性可归因于第二金属的还原性增加和从在铂上产生的部分脱氢物种促进的链增长。未来的UHV研究可以提供关于模型表面和支撑催化剂之间相关性的见解，阐明这些反应在基于铂的双金属表面上的详细机制，可能指导更有效催化剂的设计。
