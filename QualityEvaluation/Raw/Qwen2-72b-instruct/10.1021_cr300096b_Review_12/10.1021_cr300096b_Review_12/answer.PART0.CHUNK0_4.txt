[1] "In this section we will provide an overview of several types of reactions that utilize bimetallic catalysts: CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported PtFe and PtNi catalysts."
[3] "The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the PtNi system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces."
[4] "The alloyed metal and dispersion have been found to play an important role in the activity of WGS."
[5] "PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[6] "The enhanced activity of the bimetallic system can be explained by increased reducibility of Co and facilitated chain-growth by Co from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt."
[7] "The recent discovery of large natural gas reservoirs has increased efforts in finding efficient processes to partially oxidize CH4 into CO and H2."
[8] "The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts supported on a NaZSM-5 zeolite leads to better reducibility of the catalyst, higher Ni dispersion, and increased activity and stability for CH4 reforming by CO2."

1.Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been shown to influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. For CO oxidation, the interface confinement effect and enhanced reactivity have been confirmed for the PtNi system, where reversible structures such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111) surfaces have been identified. In the water gas shift reaction, the alloyed metal and dispersion play a significant role in activity, with PtRe and PtCo catalysts exhibiting higher activity than Pt alone. For methane conversions, PtCo catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products more efficiently than monometallic catalysts, attributed to increased reducibility of Co and facilitated chain-growth by Co from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights by correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

1.基于Pt的双金属催化剂已被证明在反应器研究中影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率。对于CO氧化，已经证实PtNi系统中的界面限制效应和增强的反应性，其中可逆结构如NiO1x/PtNiPt(111)和NiO1x/Pt(111)表面已被识别。在水煤气变换反应中，合金金属和分散度在活性中起着重要作用，PtRe和PtCo催化剂的活性高于Pt。对于甲烷转化，PtCo催化剂已被证明能更有效地将甲烷转化为C2+产品，这归因于Co的还原性增加和由Pt上产生的部分脱氢物种促进的Co链增长。未来的UHV研究可以通过将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联来提供见解，考虑到目前在基于Pt的双金属表面上的UHV研究的局限性。
