For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity.

For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively.
