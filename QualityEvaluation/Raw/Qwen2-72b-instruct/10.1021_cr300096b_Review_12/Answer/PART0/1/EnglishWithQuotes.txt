Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%.

For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy.

However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%.

However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction.
