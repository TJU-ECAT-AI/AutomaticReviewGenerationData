The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of PtNi bimetallic catalysts in methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction of NiO, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the preparation of Pt-Fe nanoparticles supported on nanosized silica spheres, which show high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including the presence of water and CO2 typical of PEMFC working conditions. The catalysts maintain almost 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature and remain highly active even at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms of CO oxidation and other reactions on bimetallic catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the PtSnOx system has shown to catalyze CO oxidation at moderate temperatures where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The literature also discusses the preparation and testing of PtSn/AC-N catalysts for preferential CO oxidation under hydrogen-rich feed conditions, finding that the catalyst has high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C in the water gas shift reaction. The introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band. The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS. The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric). These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu. EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific details on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals at the subsurface region exhibit superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The reversible structural modulation of the bimetallic catalysts regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments shows tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of reactions involving CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might include the inability to fully replicate the complex redox conditions and gas environments present in reactor studies.

The document does not provide information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that bimetallic catalysts have been used in many important industrial processes, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming reactions. The reversible structural changes observed in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts under different redox conditions could potentially affect their performance in these reactions. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, helping to bridge the materials gap and the pressure gap in understanding the behavior of bimetallic catalysts under real reaction conditions.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation at low temperatures (< 100 °C). The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the stability of various Fe-Pt structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres. The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled the derivation of the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe underneath showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The document also notes that Pt-skin structures with Fe or other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed higher activity than pure Pt in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The limitations of current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly mentioned, but the document highlights the importance of controlling the temperature and gaseous environment to modulate the Fe-Pt structures.

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been shown to significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, elucidating the detailed mechanisms of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Compared to their monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and can significantly reduce the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This enhanced activity is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that supported platinum catalysts, including bimetallic PtCo catalysts, have been considered promising for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reaction due to their high catalytic performance. The PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a hydrogen-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts, including the formation of bimetallic PtFe species and their impact on catalytic properties such as the oxidation of CO, dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and selective hydrogenation of citral. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions, which are currently limited due to the challenges in maintaining UHV conditions while exposing the catalyst to reactants at realistic pressures and temperatures.

The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between findings on model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The positive effect of water vapor and the negative effect of CO2 on the catalytic performance are also discussed. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not addressed in the literature. Additionally, bimetallic PdPt catalysts are less sensitive to water in the process steam compared with monometallic Pd catalysts. The effects of various factors such as support, ratio of PtPd, O2 concentration, water vapor concentration, CO2 concentration, and the combination of H2O and CO2 in the feed stream on the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts for selective CO oxidation are also discussed. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream enhances the CO oxidation activity, while CO2 concentration reduces conversion and selectivity. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction. WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS. The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric). These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu. EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific details on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals at the subsurface region exhibit superior catalytic performance in many reactions compared to pure Pt surfaces. The reversible structural modulation of the bimetallic catalysts regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments shows tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of reactions involving CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions. The current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces might include the inability to fully replicate the complex redox conditions and gas environments present in reactor studies.

The document does not provide information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that bimetallic catalysts have been used in many important industrial processes, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming reactions. The reversible structural changes observed in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts under different redox conditions could potentially affect their performance in these reactions. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, helping to bridge the materials gap and the pressure gap in understanding the behavior of bimetallic catalysts under real reaction conditions.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation at low temperatures (< 100 °C). The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the stability of various Fe-Pt structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres. The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled the derivation of the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe underneath showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The document also notes that Pt-skin structures with Fe or other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed higher activity than pure Pt in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The limitations of current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly mentioned, but the document highlights the importance of controlling the temperature and gaseous environment to modulate the Fe-Pt structures.

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been shown to significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, elucidating the detailed mechanisms of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Compared to their monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and can significantly reduce the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This enhanced activity is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that supported platinum catalysts, including bimetallic PtCo catalysts, have been considered promising for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reaction due to their high catalytic performance. The PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a hydrogen-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts, including the formation of bimetallic PtFe species and their impact on catalytic properties such as the oxidation of CO, dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and selective hydrogenation of citral. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions, which are currently limited due to the challenges in maintaining UHV conditions while exposing the catalyst to reactants at realistic pressures and temperatures.

The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between findings on model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that PtPd/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high activity for selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen. The positive effect of water vapor and the negative effect of CO2 on the catalytic performance are also discussed. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not addressed in the literature. Additionally, bimetallic PdPt catalysts are less sensitive to water in the process steam compared with monometallic Pd catalysts. The effects of various factors such as support, ratio of PtPd, O2 concentration, water vapor concentration, CO2 concentration, and the combination of H2O and CO2 in the feed stream on the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts for selective CO oxidation are also discussed. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream enhances the CO oxidation activity, while CO2 concentration reduces conversion and selectivity. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction. WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies.

Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the correlation between findings from reactor studies and model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.

The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of PtNi bimetallic catalysts in methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction of NiO, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the preparation of Pt-Fe nanoparticles supported on nanosized silica spheres, which show high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including the presence of water and CO2 typical of PEMFC working conditions. The catalysts maintain almost 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature and remain highly active even at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms of CO oxidation and other reactions on bimetallic catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the PtSnOx system has shown to catalyze CO oxidation at moderate temperatures where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The literature also discusses the preparation and testing of PtSn/AC-N catalysts for preferential CO oxidation under hydrogen-rich feed conditions, finding that the catalyst has high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Fe-Pt catalysts have been used in the preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, achieving a high selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation at low temperatures (< 100 °C). The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining the stability of various Fe-Pt structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres. The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled the derivation of the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help in the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts. The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe underneath showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The document also notes that Pt-skin structures with Fe or other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed higher activity than pure Pt in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The limitations of current UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not explicitly mentioned, but the document highlights the importance of controlling the temperature and gaseous environment to modulate the Fe-Pt structures.

Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been shown to significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, elucidating the detailed mechanisms of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Compared to their monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and can significantly reduce the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This enhanced activity is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that supported platinum catalysts, including bimetallic PtCo catalysts, have been considered promising for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reaction due to their high catalytic performance. The PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a hydrogen-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts, including the formation of bimetallic PtFe species and their impact on catalytic properties such as the oxidation of CO, dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and selective hydrogenation of citral. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions, which are currently limited due to the challenges in maintaining UHV conditions while exposing the catalyst to reactants at realistic pressures and temperatures.

The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between findings on model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that PtPd/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high activity for selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen. The positive effect of water vapor and the negative effect of CO2 on the catalytic performance are also discussed. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not addressed in the literature. Additionally, bimetallic PdPt catalysts are less sensitive to water in the process steam compared with monometallic Pd catalysts. The effects of various factors such as support, ratio of PtPd, O2 concentration, water vapor concentration, CO2 concentration, and the combination of H2O and CO2 in the feed stream on the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts for selective CO oxidation are also discussed. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream enhances the CO oxidation activity, while CO2 concentration reduces conversion and selectivity. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction. WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt and Ru bimetallic catalysts can improve the stability and activity of catalysts for methane partial oxidation, leading to higher selectivity towards CO and H2 production. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the correlation between findings from reactor studies and model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.

The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of PtNi bimetallic catalysts in methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction of NiO, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the preparation of Pt-Fe nanoparticles supported on nanosized silica spheres, which show high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including the presence of water and CO2 typical of PEMFC working conditions. The catalysts maintain almost 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature and remain highly active even at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms of CO oxidation and other reactions on bimetallic catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the PtSnOx system has shown to catalyze CO oxidation at moderate temperatures where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The literature also discusses the preparation and testing of PtSn/AC-N catalysts for preferential CO oxidation under hydrogen-rich feed conditions, finding that the catalyst has high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that AuPt/CeO2 catalyst shows the highest activity with 78% conversion of CO at 250 C in the water gas shift reaction. The introduction of platinum in AuPt/CeO2 catalyst is responsible for the formation of partly oxidized gold species probably due to the interatomic charge transfer from Au 5d to Pt 5d band. The presence of both gold and platinum is beneficial to the reduction of ceria to Ce3+ species as well as the creation of oxygen vacancies and makes the average size of ceria smaller. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu and PdCu, exhibited higher oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) activity than monometallic catalysts while the superiority of bimetallic catalysts was not as pronounced in WGS. The TPR and OSC measurements revealed the existence of strong interaction between Pt and Cu or between Pd and Cu, which makes the bimetallic catalyst more resistant toward oxidation (less pyrophoric). These characteristics were found originated from a unique structure of bimetallic particles, highly dispersed Pt in Cu or Pd in Cu. EXAFS spectra indicated that Cu forms alloys with Pt and with Pd. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption, decreasing the amount of surface carbonate on CeO2. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

For CO oxidation, the bimetallic catalysts, particularly those involving Pt and transition metals like Fe and Ni, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The interface confinement effect and the presence of specific surface structures, such as NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) and NiO1x/Pt(111), play a crucial role in the enhanced CO oxidation activity. In the water gas shift reaction, the addition of metals like Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts leads to higher activity, with dispersion and the nature of the alloyed metal being key factors. For methane conversions, bimetallic catalysts like PtCo and PtNi show higher conversion rates into C2+ products and improved selectivity towards CO and H2, respectively. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the second metal and facilitated chain growth from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, elucidating the detailed mechanisms of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and potentially guiding the design of more efficient catalysts.

The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Compared to their monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and can significantly reduce the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This enhanced activity is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that supported platinum catalysts, including bimetallic PtCo catalysts, have been considered promising for the preferential CO oxidation (PROX) reaction due to their high catalytic performance. The PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is highly efficient for PROX in a hydrogen-rich gas stream even with a small amount of Pt (0.5wt%) at temperatures below 423K. The presence of isolated bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles interacting with the support seems to give rise to this high catalytic activity. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts, including the formation of bimetallic PtFe species and their impact on catalytic properties such as the oxidation of CO, dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and selective hydrogenation of citral. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions, which are currently limited due to the challenges in maintaining UHV conditions while exposing the catalyst to reactants at realistic pressures and temperatures.

The addition of Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the catalytic performance and gives a flatter bed temperature profile in oxidative steam reforming of methane. The PtNi species can be maintained in the metallic state near the bed inlet, which can be the active site for the reforming reaction as well as the combustion reaction. The Pt atoms introduced by the sequential impregnation method are located more preferably on the surface of PtNi bimetallic particles, which increases the amount of reduced Ni at the catalyst bed inlet, even under the presence of O2 in the gas phase during oxidative steam reforming of methane. This indicates that the addition of Pt enhances the resistance to oxidation of Ni, and also that the addition of Pt is more effective in the sequential impregnation method than in the co-impregnation method, due to the difference in the segregation of PtNi surface alloy. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between findings on model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that PtPd/CeO2 catalysts exhibit high activity for selective CO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen. The positive effect of water vapor and the negative effect of CO2 on the catalytic performance are also discussed. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not addressed in the literature. Additionally, bimetallic PdPt catalysts are less sensitive to water in the process steam compared with monometallic Pd catalysts. The effects of various factors such as support, ratio of PtPd, O2 concentration, water vapor concentration, CO2 concentration, and the combination of H2O and CO2 in the feed stream on the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts for selective CO oxidation are also discussed. The addition of water vapor to the feed stream enhances the CO oxidation activity, while CO2 concentration reduces conversion and selectivity. Future UHV studies could potentially correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, providing insights into the mechanisms and efficiencies of these reactions on bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction. WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The literature does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that Pt and Ru bimetallic catalysts can improve the stability and activity of catalysts for methane partial oxidation, leading to higher selectivity towards CO and H2 production. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into the correlation between findings from reactor studies and model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.
