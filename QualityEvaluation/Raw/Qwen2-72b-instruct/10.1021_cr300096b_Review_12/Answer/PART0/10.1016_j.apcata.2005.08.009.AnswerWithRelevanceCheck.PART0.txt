          The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does state that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) has been applied to increase hydrogen production for the synthesis of ammonia and that advanced LTS catalysts are needed to produce essentially CO-free hydrogen to feed the PEM fuel cells under development for automobiles. The study investigated the mechanistic difference of WGS reaction over TiO2-supported Pt and Pd catalysts with and without Re addition, employing kinetic and infrared spectroscopic techniques. It was found that the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. Different types of CO adsorption occurred by addition of Re, which are observed in the IR spectra taken after WGS reaction. WGS reaction proceeds via the formation of the surface-formate anion over Re-added Pt and Pd catalysts, and the formation step of formats is the rate-determining step of WGS reaction. Future UHV studies could provide insights in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

          文献没有提供具体信息关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转换在反应器研究中的机制和效率。但是，它确实指出水煤气转换反应（WGS反应）已被应用于增加氢气生产，用于合成氨。并且，需要先进的LTS催化剂来生产基本上无CO的氢气，以供正在开发用于汽车的PEM燃料电池使用。研究通过动力学和红外光谱技术，调查了TiO2支持的Pt和Pd催化剂在添加和不添加Re的情况下，WGS反应的机制差异。研究发现，PdRe/TiO2催化剂的活性受Re含量的强烈影响，而PtRe/TiO2催化剂的活性对Re添加比例的依赖性较小，而对还原温度的依赖性较大。在PtRe(2:3)和PdRe(1:1)/TiO2催化剂的情况下，确认了Pt和Re或Pd和Re之间形成了一定的双金属簇。通过添加Re，发生了不同类型的CO吸附，这在WGS反应后拍摄的IR光谱中观察到。WGS反应通过在添加Re的Pt和Pd催化剂上形成表面-甲酸盐阴离子进行，格式的形成步骤是WGS反应的速率决定步骤。考虑到目前在基于Pt的双金属表面上进行UHV研究的局限性，未来的UHV研究可以提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解。
