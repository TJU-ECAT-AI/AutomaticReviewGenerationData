Bimetallic catalysts have emerged as pivotal players in facilitating a range of industrially significant reactions, including CO oxidation, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. In CO oxidation, bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of noble metals like platinum and palladium, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. The WGS reaction, crucial for hydrogen production, benefits from the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts, such as copper-zinc alloys, which improve the reaction's efficiency and CO conversion rates. Methane conversions, aiming to transform this abundant resource into more valuable products, are also catalyzed effectively by bimetallic systems, notably nickel-based catalysts modified with metals like ruthenium or palladium. Reactor studies have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying these enhancements, revealing the importance of electronic and geometric effects in bimetallic catalysts. These findings have significant implications for future ultra-high vacuum (UHV) research, which can provide atomic-level insights into the active sites and reaction pathways on model surfaces and supported catalysts. By bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and applied catalysis, UHV studies on bimetallic systems promise to guide the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for these critical reactions.
