Pt-based bimetallic catalysts significantly impact CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions, as evidenced by studies on PtFe and PtNi catalysts \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\]. In CO oxidation, PtFe and PtNi catalysts exhibit enhanced activity due to interface confinement effects and specific surface structures like NiO1x/PtNiPt(111) \[10.1021/cr300096b\_12\]. The water gas shift reaction benefits from the addition of Re, Co, and Au to Pt-based catalysts, with dispersion and alloyed metal nature being key factors \[10.1016/j.apcata.2005.08.009\]. Methane conversions are improved by PtCo and PtNi, with increased reducibility and facilitated chain growth \[10.1021/cr300096b\_12\].
