The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\]. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to Ni catalysts reduces NiO size, eases its reduction, and ensures a uniform nickel distribution, as evidenced by TPR, FTIR, and XPS data. Pt-Fe nanoparticles supported on silica spheres exhibit high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including water and CO2, typical of PEMFC environments \[10.1126/science.1188267\]. These catalysts maintain 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature, with sustained activity at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to CUF sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-based ones, play a significant role in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.014\]. The PtSnOx system catalyzes CO oxidation at moderate temperatures through a synergistic bifunctional mechanism, where Pt adsorbs CO and SnOx facilitates oxygen adsorption. PtSn/AC-N catalysts exhibit high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, under hydrogen-rich conditions.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced bimetallic catalysts with enhanced selectivity and efficiency for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. The potential of UHV studies in correlating reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts offers a promising avenue for in-depth mechanistic insights. Addressing the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as the inability to fully replicate complex redox conditions and gas environments present in reactor studies, could lead to breakthroughs in catalyst design and optimization. The exploration of novel bimetallic combinations and the investigation of their synergistic effects on catalytic performance under various reaction conditions could further expand the horizons of catalysis research.

The comprehensive overview of significant catalytic reactions utilizing bimetallic catalysts, with a focus on reactor studies and their implications for future UHV research on model surfaces and supported catalysts, reveals the pivotal role of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\]. A minor addition of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to Ni catalysts for methane reforming with CO2 reduces NiO size, facilitates its reduction, and ensures a uniform distribution of nickel particles, as evidenced by TPR, FTIR, and XPS data \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\].

PtSnOx systems exhibit high activity in CO oxidation due to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt adsorbs CO and SnOx facilitates oxygen adsorption \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.014\]. PtSn/AC-N catalysts show high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, under hydrogen-rich conditions \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.014\]. AuPt/CeO2 exhibits high activity, achieving 78% CO conversion at 250Â°C in the water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2010.04.005\]. Platinum's introduction facilitates the formation of partly oxidized gold species through interatomic charge transfer, aiding ceria reduction to Ce3+ species and oxygen vacancy creation \[10.1016/j.cattod.2010.04.005\]. Bimetallic catalysts, notably PtCu and PdCu supported on ceria, show higher activity in oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) than monometallic counterparts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.014\]. Strong metal-metal interactions, as evidenced by TPR and OSC measurements, make these catalysts more oxidation-resistant \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.014\]. EXAFS spectra reveal Cu forming alloys with Pt and Pd, and the unique structure of bimetallic particles, with highly dispersed Pt or Pd in Cu, is key to their performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.014\]. The presence of Cu in PdCu/CeO2 facilitates CO2 desorption and reduces surface carbonate on CeO2 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.014\]. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals, outperform pure Pt in CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions \[10.1002/cphc.200900053\]. Their reversible structural modulation, controlled by oxidation and reduction cycles, tunes surface CO adsorption strength and oxidation ability \[10.1002/cphc.200900053\]. Bimetallic catalysts, notably those based on Pt, are crucial in industrial processes like fuel cells and catalytic reforming \[10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086\]. Their performance in reactions such as CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions can be influenced by reversible structural changes under different redox conditions \[10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086\]. Fe-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit high selectivity for CO oxidation at low temperatures (<100Â°C) due to the subsurface Fe modifying the surface Pt's electronic structure, affecting adsorption and reaction characteristics \[10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1\]. Future UHV studies could correlate these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts by examining Fe-Pt structure stability under various conditions, aiding in the design of high-performance, low-cost catalysts \[10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1\]. Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity than pure Pt in oxygen reduction reactions, highlighting the importance of controlling temperature and gaseous environment to modulate Fe-Pt structures \[10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1\].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced UHV techniques that can replicate complex reactor conditions, including realistic pressures and gas environments, to better understand the behavior of bimetallic catalysts under real reaction conditions. The design of high-performance, low-cost catalysts could be accelerated by correlating findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering insights into mechanisms and efficiencies on bimetallic surfaces. The exploration of novel bimetallic combinations and the optimization of existing ones, such as PtFe, PtNi, PtSn, AuPt/CeO2, PtCu, PdCu, and Fe-Pt, could lead to the discovery of more efficient catalysts for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. The investigation of the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic surfaces under reaction conditions could provide a deeper understanding of the role of subsurface metals and their influence on surface Pt's electronic structure, affecting adsorption and reaction characteristics. The control of temperature and gaseous environment to modulate bimetallic structures could be a key factor in the design of catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability. The bridging of materials and pressure gaps in UHV studies could offer insights into bimetallic catalyst behavior under real reaction conditions, guiding the development of efficient catalysts for industrial processes like fuel cells and catalytic reforming.
