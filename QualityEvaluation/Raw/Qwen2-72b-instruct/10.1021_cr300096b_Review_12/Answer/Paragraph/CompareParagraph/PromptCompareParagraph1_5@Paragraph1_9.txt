The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\]. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) to Ni catalysts reduces NiO size, eases its reduction, and ensures a uniform nickel distribution, as evidenced by TPR, FTIR, and XPS data. Pt-Fe nanoparticles supported on silica spheres exhibit high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including water and CO2, typical of PEMFC environments \[10.1126/science.1188267\]. These catalysts maintain 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature, with sustained activity at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to CUF sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-based ones, play a significant role in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.014\]. The PtSnOx system catalyzes CO oxidation at moderate temperatures through a synergistic bifunctional mechanism, where Pt adsorbs CO and SnOx facilitates oxygen adsorption. PtSn/AC-N catalysts exhibit high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, under hydrogen-rich conditions.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of advanced bimetallic catalysts with enhanced selectivity and efficiency for CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. The potential of UHV studies in correlating reactor findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts offers a promising avenue for in-depth mechanistic insights. Addressing the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, such as the inability to fully replicate complex redox conditions and gas environments present in reactor studies, could lead to breakthroughs in catalyst design and optimization. The exploration of novel bimetallic combinations and the investigation of their synergistic effects on catalytic performance under various reaction conditions could further expand the horizons of catalysis research.

4.4 Other Important Catalytic Reactions
In this section we will provide an overview of several types of reactions that utilize bimetallic catalysts: CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts. Table 8 lists selected reactor studies for each of the three reactions.
Table 8. Summary of Selected Reactions over Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
4.4.1 CO Oxidation
Preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO has received significant attention due to the demand of CO-free hydrogen for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Su et al. (271) have performed DFT calculations of CO oxidation on surfaces of bulk Pt&ndash;Ni alloys and Pt(111). On the basis of the binding energies of adsorbed CO, O, and H, as well as the activation barriers for elemental reaction steps of CO and H oxidation, Pt-terminated Pt3Ni(111) is identified as an optimum catalyst for CO PROX in excess of hydrogen. (271)
The oxidation of CO is also studied on Fe/Pt(111), with the bimetallic surface structures being reversibly controlled between FeO/Pt(111) and subsurface Pt&ndash;Fe&ndash;Pt(111) via alternating oxidation and reduction treatments. (207, 208) The reversibility between these two structures leads to the tunability of the surface PROX activity on Fe/Pt(111). (208) The bimetallic surface transformation study is also carried out over supported Pt&ndash;3d transition metal (3d = Co, Ni, and Cu) nanoparticles treated at alternating oxidation and reduction atmospheres, and the reversible structural changes are also observed. (209)
Guided by the formation of FeO/Pt(111) surface after the oxidation treatment of Fe/Pt(111) and its importance in controlling PROX, Yao et al. (396) have prepared two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands supported on Pt(111) surface with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure using a two-step process. The FeO nanoislands are characterized using STM, XPS, and HREELS and are found to exhibit distinct atomic structures and electronic states from the strong interaction between FeO and the Pt(111) substrate. The coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites confined by crystalline matrix and on highly diluted samples are proposed to have high reactivity and stability in oxidation reactions. (397) The confinement effect at the interface between FeO nanoislands and Pt(111) is studied by Fu et al. (272) for CO oxidation. An oxygen-deficient FeO1&ndash;x/Pt(111) surface shows higher CO oxidation reactivity than Pt(111) and other Fe oxide overlayers, i.e., FeO1+x/Pt(111) surfaces. Attempts are made to prepare the CUF active sites over supported catalysts. The Pt&ndash;Fe/SiO2 catalyst shows significantly higher CO PROX activity than Pt/SiO2, with the bimetallic catalyst showing CO oxidation at temperatures as low as 200 K and achieving 100% CO conversion at room temperature. The highly active Pt&ndash;Fe nanocatalysts are also found to show excellent stability in a 1-KW PEMFC working system and are thus feasible for industrial application. (272) The interface confinement effect and enhanced CO oxidation are also confirmed for the Pt&ndash;Ni system by Mu et al., (273) where the reversible structures are identified as NiO1&ndash;x/Pt&ndash;Ni&ndash;Pt(111) and NiO1&ndash;x/Pt(111) surfaces. Mu et al. (273) have also proposed a synergetic effect of the surface and subsurface Ni species for CO oxidation: the surface Ni oxide nanoislands activate O2 to produce atomic O species, and the subsurface Ni atoms further enhance the elementary reaction of CO oxidation with O.
The results on model surfaces are consistent with reactor studies over supported Pt&ndash;Fe and Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts. Pt&ndash;Fe/γ-Al2O3, Pt&ndash;Fe2/γ-Al2O3, and Pt&ndash;Fe3/γ-Al2O3 outperform Pt/γ-Al2O3 for the PROX of CO in a combined stream of CO and H2. (398) Siani et al. have proposed that the increased activity for CO oxidation correlates with the extent of Pt&ndash;Fe interactions and the strength of CO adsorption. (286) PROX of CO over supported Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 shows that the bimetallic catalyst has higher CO conversion with higher CO2 selectivity over a wide reaction temperature range in the presence of excess hydrogen. At low temperature, increasing the molar ratio of Ni/Pt increases the catalytic activity of Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3. (377) The coimpregnated Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a much lower reduction temperature than Pt,Ni/γ-Al2O3 and Ni,Pt/γ-Al2O3 prepared by sequential impregnation. (376) Alumina is a superior support when compared with TiO2 and ZrO2. (376)
Pt&ndash;Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are also more active than either parent metal for CO oxidation in gas streams containing hydrogen. (378) When supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), Pt&ndash;Co is highly efficient for CO PROX in a H2-rich gas stream at temperatures below 423 K. The addition of Co to Pt/YSZ results in enhancement of catalytic performance, especially in the temperature region below 423 K. Isolated bimetallic Pt&ndash;Co nanoparticles interacting with the support seem to give rise to the high catalytic activity. (379) Findings by Komatsu and Tamura agree that Pt&ndash;Co/SiO2 catalysts are more effective for PROX than either parent metal. (380) By varying the Pt/Co atomic ratios in the catalysts, a ratio of Pt/Co = 3 is identified as the most effective for the PROX reaction. (380)
Pt&ndash;Sn/AC is active for CO oxidation when the AC support is treated with HNO3 prior to impregnation. The acid treatment creates an acidic surface that aids in the formation of Pt&ndash;Sn alloys. (383) The Pt&ndash;Sn catalyst is synthesized by sequential impregnation with high temperature reduction at 673 K. Aksoylu et al. have proposed that sequential impregnation leads to higher activity because less Pt is alloyed with Sn, making more Pt sites available for CO oxidation. (382) Quantum calculations by Gülmen et al. on Pt&ndash;Sn surfaces show that Pt&ndash;Sn bimetallic particles adsorb CO more weakly than Pt alone. The studies also indicate that Sn present in the subsurface configuration strengthens CO adsorption, while neighboring Sn on the surface destabilizes CO adsorption. (399)
Pt&ndash;Mn/γ-Al2O3 with different loadings of Mn is active for partial oxidation of CO. TPR results indicate that Pt promotes the reduction of Mn to a greater extent and at lower temperatures than monometallic Mn. Catalysts with low Mn content show no improvement in catalytic activity, but CO oxidation activity increases dramatically in catalysts with compositions of Mn above 8 wt %. In the presence of CO2, catalytic activity increases and CO conversion reaches 100% for the 15 wt % Mn, Pt&ndash;Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of H2O to the feed stream significantly decreases catalytic activity, possibly due to steam poisoning of oxygen vacancies in MnOx. (384)
Other metals, such as Pd, (381) Ru, (400) and Re, (385) are active when alloyed with Pt for CO oxidation. Pt&ndash;Pd/CeO2, (381) Pt&ndash;Ru/SiO2, (400) and Pt&ndash;Re/SiO2 (385) all demonstrate enhanced PROX activity over the corresponding monometallic catalysts. For the latter catalyst, EXAFS analysis confirms the existence of Pt&ndash;Re bimetallic bonds. The synergistic effect occurs when the reduced Pt&ndash;Re bimetallic particles dissociate O2, which then spills over to the Pt particles to oxidize CO. (385)
4.4.2 Water Gas Shift Reaction
Water gas shift (WGS) is an important reaction typically used during and after reforming to increase the yield of H2. CO is oxidized by H2O to produce an additional mole of H2 with CO2 as a waste gas. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are active for the WGS reaction and show enhanced activity when alloyed with Re, (386, 387) Co, (386) and Au. (388) The alloyed metal and dispersion have been found to play an important role in the activity of WGS. In comparing a series of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts over γ-Al2O3 and TiO2, catalysts containing Pt&ndash;Re and Pt&ndash;Co exhibit a higher WGS activity than Pt, but Pt&ndash;Mo, Pt&ndash;Sn, and Pt&ndash;Cu show a lower WGS activity. Reports by Choung et al. show that Pt&ndash;Re catalysts display higher activity because Re increases Pt dispersion on TiO2 and γ-Al2O3. (386) Sato et al. report that the WGS activity over Pt&ndash;Re/TiO2 exhibits a mild dependence on Re content and a strong dependence on reduction temperature. (387) Additional Re increases the amount of Re on the catalyst surface and leads to an increase in the rate of WGS. (387)
Although the metals used for WGS play an important role, the support often participates in the WGS chemistry. For example, adding Pt to a Au/CeO2 catalyst is much more active for WGS than either parent metal. The introduction of Pt to the Au catalyst leads to the formation of a partially oxidized gold species. The presence of Au and Pt also help keep ceria in a Ce3+ state, which creates oxygen vacancies and aids in the overall activity of the catalyst. (388)
Kugai et al. examine the enhancement of water gas shift by the addition of oxygen to the feed stream (OWGS). Pt&ndash;Cu/CeO2 exhibits higher OWGS activity than monometallic catalysts, but the higher activity is not as pronounced in traditional WGS. (389) The addition of oxygen to the reaction is suggested to both lower the CO surface coverage and increase the number of available surface sites to participate in the reaction. Another possible explanation is that supported Pt&ndash;Cu bimetallic catalysts are reduced more easily than the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
4.4.3 CH4 Conversion
The large abundance of natural gas makes methane an attractive feedstock for use in hydrogen production, in the synthesis of more complex molecules, and as a direct fuel. (289) Pt&ndash;Co catalysts have been shown to convert methane into C2+ products with higher conversion than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. (390) The enhanced activity of the bimetallic system can be explained by increased reducibility of Co and facilitated chain-growth by Co from partially dehydrogenated species produced on Pt. (390)
For CH4 to be used as a direct fuel, it must be fully combusted to CO2 and H2O to reduce environmental impacts, mainly because CH4 is a greenhouse gas that has an even greater global-warming potential than CO2. (401) Studies on catalytic combustion of CH4 over Pt&ndash;Pd catalysts show that the bimetallic outperforms monometallic Pd catalysts independent of the catalyst support. (392, 402) The metal particles in Pt&ndash;Pd/γ-Al2O3 consist of two phases: a PdO phase and a Pt and Pd alloy. (392, 402) Castellazzi et al. have found that the effect of Pt on PdO for CH4 combustion depends on several factors such as the extent of PdO bond formation and the strength of the Pd&ndash;support interaction. (403)
The recent discovery of large natural gas reservoirs has increased efforts in finding efficient processes to partially oxidize CH4 into CO and H2. Lanza et al. have found that Pt&ndash;Ru is an active metal combination for CH4 partial oxidation because Pt activates CH4 at low temperature and Ru is selective toward H2 and CO. The bimetallic catalyst begins to show oxidation activity at 823 K for Pt&ndash;Ru versus 903 K for the monometallic Ru catalyst. Above ∼800 K, syngas at a H2/CO ratio of 2 is produced as the favored product. (394, 395) DFT and experimental results show that Pt&ndash;Ru core&ndash;shell nanoparticles have a weaker CO binding energy than monometallic Pt nanoparticles, leading to lower CO coverage and higher activity. (156)
Pt&ndash;Ni (391) catalysts have also been evaluated for the partial oxidation of CH4. Small amounts of Pt are added to the Ni catalyst to reduce the extent of Ni oxidation. In this case, the high reducibility of Pt and the high activity of Ni are both utilized. Introduction of Pt to Ni catalysts by sequential impregnation enhances the catalytic performance by keeping Ni reduced in the presence of oxygen. (391) Characterization by TEM, TPR, EXAFS, and FTIR suggest that the catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation are mostly Pt-terminated while catalysts prepared by coimpregnation do not show increased amounts of surface Pt. The lack of surface Pt in the coimpregnated catalyst may lead to rapid deactivation from the oxidation of Ni, possibly explaining the decreased activity.
Steam reforming of CH4 encounters problems of coking and fast deactivation of catalysts. (404) However, research groups have found that Pt&ndash;Ni is an effective catalyst for reforming of CH4. (172, 358, 360-362) For example, Pt&ndash;Ni supported on MgAl2O4 exhibits self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics. (393) Without prereduction, the Pt&ndash;Ni bimetallic catalyst dissociates CH4 under reaction conditions to form hydrogen, which spills over and reduces other metallic particles on the catalyst. The addition of Pt to the Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst also prevents deactivation by helping the alloyed Ni rereduce from Ni2+ to Ni0. At increased Ni loading the self-activation and self-regeneration characteristics are no longer present. (393)
Dry reforming of methane is an attractive process because it utilizes two abundant, cheap compounds as a hydrogen source; however, the process requires high temperatures, and the catalyst deactivates quickly due to coking. Pinheiro et al. show that Pt&ndash;Ni supported on polytype A of beta-zeolite (BEA) zeolites has superior activity and stability for dry reforming of methane, compared with γ-Al2O3 and AC supports, due to its high resistance to coking. (359) These findings are confirmed by Arishtirova et al., who find that the addition of Pt to Ni catalysts supported on a NaZSM-5 zeolite leads to better reducibility of the catalyst, higher Ni dispersion, and increased activity and stability for CH4 reforming by CO2. (357) In addition, Pt&ndash;Re (345) supported on ceria&ndash;zirconia mixed oxides shows enhanced dry reforming activity. The Pt&ndash;Re interaction reduces coke deposition, improves Pt dispersion, and significantly enhances selectivity and stability, while oxygen exchange of the reactants is facilitated by the reducible support.
4.5 Brief Summary of Pt-Based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts
Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized for both anodic and cathodic reactions in low-temperature fuel cells, in particular PEMFCs. For example, Pt&ndash;Ru and Pt&ndash;Rh based catalysts are promising anode catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol (405) and ethanol, (406) respectively. Pt&ndash;3d alloys have been extensively studied as cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Similar to that described for the hydrogenation reaction in section 4.1, the subsurface Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt structures are preferred for the ORR reaction due to optimized binding with atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups. One of the challenges is to prevent the segregation of subsurface 3d metals to the surface, which is thermodynamically favorable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, as described in section 3.1. The topic of electrocatalysts is beyond the scope of the current review; however, the basic principles, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques in the current review share many common themes with Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts. Interested readers can refer to several recent reviews on bimetallic electrocatalysts. (405, 407, 408)
4.6 Brief Summary of Trimetallic Catalysts
Some recent studies show that trimetallic catalysts exhibit better performance than both monometallic and bimetallic systems. For example, Epron et al. (409) have studied n-heptane reforming on Pt&ndash;Sn and Pt&ndash;Ir&ndash;Sn/Al2O3 catalysts and find that the addition of Sn to the bimetallic Pt&ndash;Ir increases the stability of the catalysts and also the selectivity toward toluene. Compared with Pt&ndash;Sn bimetallic catalysts, less Sn is needed in Pt&ndash;Ir&ndash;Sn trimetallic catalyst to obtain the same toluene yield. Aranishi et al. (410) have synthesized the Au/Co/Fe triple-layered core&ndash;shell nanoparticles that exhibit much higher catalytic activities for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane than the corresponding monometallic (Au, Co, Fe) or bimetallic (AuCo, AuFe, CoFe) catalysts. Pd/Ag/Rh trimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized and exhibit high hydrogenation activity of methyl acrylate at an atomic composition of Pd/Ag/Rh = 1/2/13.5 and an average diameter of 2.2 nm. (411) The mechanism of the promoted reactivity in trimetallic catalysts has also been investigated. For example, Fang et al (412) have studied the electrooxidation of formic acid on Au@Pd@Pt NPs and find a synergistic effect between the three different nanostructure components (sphere, shell, and islands). Using FePtAu nanoparticles as an example, Zhang et al. (413) demonstrate that the presence of Au in FePtAu facilitates FePt structure transformation from chemically disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct) structure.
