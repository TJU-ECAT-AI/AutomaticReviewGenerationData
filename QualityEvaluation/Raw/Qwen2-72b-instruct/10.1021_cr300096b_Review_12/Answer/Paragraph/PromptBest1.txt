The study reveals that adjusting the Pt/Ni ratio in bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2 impacts surface properties and catalytic behavior \[10.1007/s11144-007-5139-8\]. Incorporating a small amount of Pt (0.3-0.5 wt.%) into Ni catalysts decreases NiO size, facilitates its reduction, and ensures a uniform nickel distribution, as evidenced by TPR, FTIR, and XPS data. Pt-Fe nanoparticles on silica spheres exhibit high activity and stability in CO oxidation under realistic conditions, including water and CO2, typical of PEMFC environments \[10.1126/science.1188267\]. These catalysts maintain 100% CO conversion and selectivity at room temperature and remain active at lower temperatures. The high reactivity is attributed to coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites at the peripheries of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) surfaces. Bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2011.06.014\]. The PtSnOx system catalyzes CO oxidation at moderate temperatures through a synergistic bifunctional mechanism, where Pt offers CO adsorption sites and SnOx facilitates oxygen adsorption. PtSn/AC-N catalysts exhibit high CO conversion and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures, under hydrogen-rich conditions. Bimetallic catalysts, notably AuPt/CeO2, exhibit high activity in CO oxidation, achieving 78% conversion at 250°C in the water gas shift reaction \[10.1016/j.cattod.2010.04.005\]. Platinum's introduction facilitates the formation of partly oxidized gold species and aids in ceria reduction to Ce3+ species, creating oxygen vacancies and reducing ceria size. Bimetallic catalysts, notably PtCu and PdCu on ceria, exhibit superior oxygen-enhanced water gas shift (OWGS) activity compared to monometallic counterparts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2010.10.014\]. Strong metal-metal interactions, as evidenced by TPR and OSC measurements, make these catalysts more oxidation-resistant. EXAFS spectra confirm the formation of Pt-Cu and Pd-Cu alloys, with Cu facilitating CO2 desorption and reducing surface carbonate on ceria. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those with Pt-skin surfaces and 3d transition metals, outperform pure Pt in CO oxidation, water gas shift, and methane conversions \[10.1002/cphc.200900053\]. Their reversible structural modulation, controlled by oxidation and reduction cycles, tunes surface CO adsorption strength and oxidation ability. Bimetallic catalysts, notably Pt-based ones, play a crucial role in industrial processes like fuel cells and catalytic reforming \[10.1016/j.apsusc.2009.03.086\]. Their reversible structural changes under redox conditions may impact performance in CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions. Fe-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit high selectivity for CO oxidation at low temperatures, attributed to the electronic structure modification of surface Pt by subsurface Fe \[10.1016/s1872-2067(09)60037-1\]. This influences adsorption and reaction characteristics, making Pt-skin structures active in hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygen reduction reactions.
