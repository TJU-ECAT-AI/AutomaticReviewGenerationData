1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface, and that PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Future UHV studies could provide insights into the correlation between findings on model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到CO氧化反应发生在吸附的CO和吸附的O在Pt表面上。据报道，PtSn/AC样品在还原步骤中形成的PtSn合金对CO氧化具有活性。Pt丰富的Pt3Sn可以在比PtSn更低的温度下更容易地吸附氧气。单金属样品的不活性可以通过吸附的碳一氧化物在反应开始几分钟内阻塞Pt位点从而抑制氧气吸附来解释。据报道，在还原步骤中形成的PtSn合金对CO氧化具有活性。未来的UHV研究可以提供关于模型表面和支撑催化剂之间发现的相关性的见解，考虑到目前在Pt基双金属表面上进行UHV研究的局限性。
