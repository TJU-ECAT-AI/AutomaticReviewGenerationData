How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface. Oxygen is adsorbed on the Pt surface dissociatively at temperatures above 100 K, needing two adjacent sites for adsorption, whereas CO needs only one site. After the reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and O, the CO2 formed desorbs. The document also notes that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. Of the two Pt alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, the Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The Pt3Sn phase was the only alloy found on the coimpregnated catalysts prepared on oxidized activated carbons ACN2 and ACN3. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the high temperature reduction procedure that increases the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction in the preparation and activation of PtSn/AC catalysts for CO oxidation is highly beneficial. The 1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3 catalyst, prepared by sequential impregnation on the HNO3 oxidised support showed the highest activity; when reduced at higher temperature (procedure R2), the CO conversion reached 100%.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气变换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到CO氧化反应发生在吸附的CO和吸附的O之间的Pt表面上。在100 K以上的温度下，氧气在Pt表面上以解离方式吸附，需要两个相邻的吸附位点，而CO只需要一个位点。在吸附的CO和O之间发生反应后，形成的CO2脱附。文档还指出，PtSn/AC样品在还原步骤中形成的PtSn合金据报道对CO氧化具有活性。在两种Pt合金中，PtSn和Pt3Sn，Pt丰富的Pt3Sn在较低温度下比PtSn更容易吸附氧气。Pt3Sn相是仅在氧化活性炭ACN2和ACN3上制备的共浸渍催化剂上发现的合金。单金属样品的不活性可以通过吸附的碳一氧化物在反应的最初几分钟内阻塞Pt位点，从而抑制氧气吸附来解释。在还原步骤中形成的PtSn合金据报道对CO氧化具有活性。结果表明，提高Sn还原和PtSn相互作用的高温还原程序在PtSn/AC催化剂的制备和活化中对CO氧化具有高度益处。1 wt.% Pt0.25 wt.% Sn/ACN3催化剂，在HNO3氧化的支撑上通过顺序浸渍制备，显示出最高的活性；在较高温度下还原(程序R2)，CO转化率达到100%。

1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does discuss the effects of surface chemistry of the support, preparation method of the catalyst, Pt:Sn ratio, and reduction procedure on the activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation. The study indicates that applying HNO3 oxidation pretreatment to the AC support helps the formation of PtSn alloys, sequential impregnation procedure leads to the formation of active metallic Pt sites as well as Pt-rich alloy, high temperature reduction procedure is beneficial for increasing the Sn reduction and PtSn interaction, and strong CO adsorption can lead to fast deactivation due to inhibition of oxygen adsorption. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights by correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.
