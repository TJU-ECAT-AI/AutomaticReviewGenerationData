1.The document does not provide specific information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the CO oxidation reaction takes place between adsorbed CO and adsorbed O on the Pt surface, and that the PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The Pt rich Pt3Sn can adsorb oxygen more readily at lower temperatures than PtSn. The inactivity of the monometallic samples can be explained by the inhibition of oxygen adsorption, due to adsorbed carbon monoxide which can block the Pt sites within the first minutes of the reaction. The PtSn alloys formed on PtSn/AC samples during the reduction step have been reported to be active for CO oxidation. The results indicate that the activity of PtSn/AC catalysts in CO oxidation reaction is strongly affected by the surface chemistry of the support, the preparation method of the catalyst, the Pt:Sn ratio and the reduction procedure applied.

1.文档没有提供Pt基双金属催化剂如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到CO氧化反应发生在吸附的CO和吸附的O在Pt表面上，据报道，在还原步骤中在PtSn/AC样品上形成的PtSn合金对CO氧化具有活性。Pt丰富的Pt3Sn可以在比PtSn更低的温度下更容易地吸附氧气。单金属样品的不活性可以通过吸附的碳一氧化物在反应开始的几分钟内阻塞Pt位点从而抑制氧气吸附来解释。据报道，在还原步骤中在PtSn/AC样品上形成的PtSn合金对CO氧化具有活性。结果表明，PtSn/AC催化剂在CO氧化反应中的活性受到支撑表面化学、催化剂制备方法、Pt:Sn比和还原程序的强烈影响。
