How do bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies, and what potential insights could future UHV studies provide in correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the PtSnOx system has shown to catalyze CO oxidation at moderate temperatures, where neither platinum nor tin dioxide alone has stable activity. The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism in which Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The literature also notes that the active phase on PtSn catalysts prepared on nitric acid oxidized activated carbon (AC-N) is probably the Pt3Sn alloy, which leads to enhanced CO oxidation ability. The literature does not discuss the limitations of UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces or the potential insights that future UHV studies could provide in correlating findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts.

1.文献没有提供关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂如何影响反应器研究中CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化的机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实提到PtSnOx系统在中等温度下催化CO氧化，其中铂和锡氧化物单独都没有稳定的活性。PtSnOx系统的高活性归因于协同双功能机制，其中Pt提供CO的吸附位点，而氧气在SnOx上解离吸附。文献还指出，制备在硝酸氧化活性炭(AC-N)上的PtSn催化剂的活性相可能是Pt3Sn合金，这导致增强的CO氧化能力。文献没有讨论UHV研究在基于Pt的双金属表面上的局限性，也没有讨论未来UHV研究可能在将发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联方面提供的潜在见解。

The literature also discusses the effect of CO2 and H2O presence on the PROX activity of the PtSn/AC-N catalyst, indicating that the addition of CO2 and water vapor does not significantly change the PROX activity level of the PtSn system for the 110-135 C temperature range. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The document also discusses the preparation and testing of a 1% Pt0.25% Sn supported on nitric acid treated activated carbon (AC-N) catalyst for preferential CO oxidation (PROX) under various feed compositions, including a realistic feed containing CO2, water vapor, and methane. The catalyst showed high CO conversion and selectivity, with the conversion reaching approximately 90% at 110°C for the realistic feed conditions. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

The high activity of the PtSnOx system is attributed to a synergistic bifunctional mechanism where Pt provides adsorption sites for CO, while oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on SnOx. The literature also discusses the preparation and testing of PtSn/AC-N catalysts for preferential CO oxidation under hydrogen-rich feed conditions, finding that the catalyst has high CO conversion levels and selectivity, especially at lower temperatures. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, but the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces are not discussed in the literature.
