[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "The TPR, FTIR of adsorbed CO and XPS data showed that introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

1.The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts in methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 wt.%) to the Ni catalyst resulted in a decrease in NiO size, easier reduction, and a more uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

1.研究调查了Pt/Ni比例对用于甲烷与二氧化碳重整的双金属PtNi催化剂的表面性质和催化行为的影响。向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.3至0.5 wt.%）导致NiO尺寸减小，更容易还原，镍金属颗粒分布更均匀。
