1.The literature does not provide specific details on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance compared to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes. The surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties. The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions. The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts.

1.文献没有提供具体的细节关于双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转化在反应器研究中的机制和效率。但是，它确实提到双金属催化剂通常表现出比其母金属更优越的催化性能，并且已被广泛用于许多催化过程中。双金属催化剂的表面结构对其催化性能至关重要。催化剂表面的结构在反应过程中经常动态变化。通过循环氧化和还原处理调节的可逆结构调制在双金属催化剂表面的CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力方面显示出可行的可调性。
