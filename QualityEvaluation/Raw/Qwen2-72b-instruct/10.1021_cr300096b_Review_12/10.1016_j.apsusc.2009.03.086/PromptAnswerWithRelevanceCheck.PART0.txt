1.The document does not provide information on how Pt-based bimetallic catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that bimetallic catalysts have been used in many important industrial processes, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming reactions. The reversible structural changes observed in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts under different redox conditions could potentially affect their performance in these reactions. Future UHV studies could provide insights into correlating the findings from reactor studies with model surfaces and supported catalysts, helping to bridge the materials gap and the pressure gap in understanding the behavior of bimetallic catalysts under real reaction conditions.
