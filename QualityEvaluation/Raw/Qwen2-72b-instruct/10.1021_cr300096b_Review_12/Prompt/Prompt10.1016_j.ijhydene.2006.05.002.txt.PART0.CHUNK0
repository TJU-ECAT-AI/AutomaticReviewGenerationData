1. Introduction
In the past decade, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have been extensively studied because of its high efficiency compared to conventional fossil- fuel power sources which are derived from burning petroleum products which result in pollutants such as CO2 and CO. However, CO removal in a hydrogen- rich fuel is a critical issue when liquid hydrocarbon fu- els are used as the hydrogen source for fuel cells. A small amount of CO (10 ppm) in the reformed fuel strongly adsorbs on the Pt active site and deteriorates the fuel cell performance. Therefore, these small amounts Corresponding author.

Among the CO removal methods,the preferential oxidation of CO seems to be the most promising approach. However, in this reaction water is formed via hydrogen oxidation, reverse water gas shift and CO-methanization reactions. The side reactions are as follows:

In recent years, much attention has been focused on CeO2-supported noble metal catalysts due to their

1943 applications in automotive exhausts. CeO2 is added as a promoter because of its unique redox properties, high oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and stabilization of the metal dispersion [1,2]. Summers and Ausen [3] claimed that ceria donated oxygen to Pt for the oxidation of CO on Pt/CeO2 catalyst. For Pd/CeO2, Cordatos et al. [4] observed that lattice oxygen from the ceria can be trans- ferred to the Pd surface by using the CO adsorption measurement. The argument in favor of CeO2 has been widely investigated as structural and electronic promot- ers to improve the selectivity, activity, and thermal sta- bility of the catalysts.
The selective
CO
oxidation catalysts such as alumina supported ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh) and platinum (Pt) catalysts [5,6] have been extensively stud- ied by a number of investigators and indicated that no- ble catalysts are highly efficient in removing CO [7,8] and they follow a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism.
Thus, a promising catalyst must have sites that promote CO adsorption for CO oxidation to take place and pro- vide oxygen from the support. Recently, we reported on the preparation of CeO2 using co-precipitation method which is an active support for this reaction [9].
From our previous study among the CeO2 supported noble metals, Pd/CeO2 catalyst showed poor activity for this reaction. One way to increase the activity of the Pd catalysts could be to include a Pt metal in the cata- lyst. Many studies have been made on the approach of combinatorial catalysis especially Pt and Pd for CO oxidation reaction [10]. Using bimetallic system is an attractive alternative that appears to enhance some properties of the catalyst or some synergistic effect as electronic effect/geometry effect. Although it is still not yet well understood, it has been established that the bimetallic system improves both activity and selectivity of a great number of reactions [11,12]. Here we report the synthesis of CeO2 supported PtPd catalysts for the selective CO oxidation in the large amount of hy- drogen. Interestingly, unlike Pd/CeO2 the PtPd have been found to be ionically dispersed over CeO2 sup- port and exhibited high activity at comparatively low temperatures. The main objectives of the present work are to investigate the catalytic activity of PtPd/CeO2 for selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich stream and its activity in the presence of CO2 and H2O.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The CeO2 support was prepared by solgel method.
An aqueous solution of CO(NH2)2 (Fluka) was added into a Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Fluka). The mixture was heated in an oven at 100 C for 50 h and was then washed with distilled water several times until there was no excess anion. It was dried at 110 C overnight and calcined under air atmosphere at 300 C for 2 h.
The PtPd catalysts were prepared by co-impregnating the appropriate amount of an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 ·6H2O (Fluka) and PdCl2 (Fluka) on to the ce- ria support. The prepared catalysts were dried overnight at 110 C and calcined under air at 400 C for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Information about the composition and phase of crystalline materials were obtained by the powder X- ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were obtained by a Rigaku power diffractometer system equipped with a RINT 200 wide angle goniometer using nickel- filtered CuK radiation (30 mA tube current, 40 kV tube voltage).
The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method was used to determine the surface area and pore size of the prepared catalysts by N2 adsorption/desorption at temperature of 77 K. Specific surface area was de- termine using an Autosorb-1 Gas Sorption System (Quantachrome Corporation).
A JEOL JEM 2010 equipped with the Oxford In- struments Link Isis 300 X-ray microanalysis used to obtain surface microstructures and surface composi- tions. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images crystallinity and crystal structures of the samples were evaluated from the specific selected area of electron diffraction patterns.
H2 pulse chemisorption was carried out by using temperature program desorption reduction oxidation (TPDRO/MS 1100). Prior H2 pulse chemisorption, the catalyst was reduced in 5% H2/N2 at 600 C for 1 h.
Then, the system was purged and cooled to 50 C in flowing N2. H2 pulse chemisorption was performed at 50 C using H2 99.99% purity and repeated at 5 min intervals for 10 times.
2.3. Activity measurement
Catalytic activity studies were performed in a pyrex glass U-tube reactor having an internal diameter of 6 mm under atmospheric pressure. One hundred mil- ligram of catalyst was packed between glass wool plugs in the center of the reactor. The reactant gas is com- posed of 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 and helium with the space velocity of 30, 000 ml g1 h1. The cat- alysts were also tested for the CO oxidation both in the presence of water, and CO2 using the following feed 1944

mixtures: 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 10% H2O, 40% H2 and balanced in He and 1% CO, 1% O2, 25% CO2,40% H2 and balanced in He, respectively. The reaction temperature was varied from 50 to 190 C.An on-line gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent Tech- nologies 6890N model) was used to analyze the re- actant and product composition. The column utilized in the chromatograph was a Carbosphere,80 100 mesh,10 ft × 1 8 in. stainless-steel packed column. The calcu- lation of the CO conversion was based on the carbon dioxide formation. The selectivity of CO oxidation was defined as the oxygen consumption for CO oxidation divided by the total consumption of oxygen.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
BET surface areas of the commercial and syn- thesized CeO2 are 117 and 137 m2/g, respectively.
Table 1 shows the BET surface area, average ceria crystallite size and metal dispersion of the PtPd/CeO2 catalysts with different Pt/Pd ratios. The solgel CeO2 supported catalyst gave the higher surface area and smaller CeO2 crystallite size than that of commercial CeO2 supported catalyst. The CeO2 crystallite sizes of the prepared catalysts were determined from X-ray line-broadening using the Debye Scherrer equation.
Fig. 1 shows the typical XRD patterns of the CeO2 in the PtPd/CeO2, the commercial CeO2 (Fig. 1a) and the one prepared by the solgel synthesis (Fig. 1b). It was clearly noticed that the XRD patterns of both supports could be identified as nine main reflections which are characteristic of the typical of a cubic structure of CeO2 corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2),(4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 0), (4 2 2) planes [13]. No evidence of Pt or Pd metallic peaks is obtained, indicating small particles of PtO or PdO with mean diameters less than 5 nm, below the X-ray detection range.
The TEM picture of 1% (1:7) PtPd/CeO2 impreg- nation on solgel shown in the Fig. 2(a) revealed the presence of the metallic particle size as dark spots in the catalyst. The existence of PtPd particles on CeO2 support was verified by using EDS. The mean diameters derived from histograms are shown in Fig. 2b and they are uniformly distributed on the support. The average particle size of metallic particle size is about 1.92 nm.
3.2. Catalytic activity
3.2.1. Effect of support
Two types of support were observed for the activ- ity of 1% (1:1) PtPd/CeO2 at temperature range of
50.190 C. As shown in Fig. 3, CO conversion and
selectivity of solgel CeO2 supported catalysts were higher than that of commercial CeO2 for all tempera- ture range of interest. Increasing temperature from 50 to 130 C increased the CO conversion from 10% to 41% for solgel CeO2 supported catalysts and from 5% to 12% for commercial CeO2 supported catalysts.
The temperature at maximum CO conversion of solgel supported catalyst was 130 C whereas the selectiv- ity decreased with increasing temperature. The maxi- mum selectivity of solgel support and of commercial support was 65% and 51%, respectively, at 50 C, the lowest temperature. The CO conversion and selectivity correspond very well with the results of Mario and co-worker [14] using a similar catalyst. In fact, as the temperature increases the H2 oxidation appeared to be greatly favored at high temperatures and its rate be- comes faster than CO oxidation reaction. Moreover, H2 oxidation had higher activation energy than CO oxida- tion [15].
In the case of ceria-based catalysts, as the reducible ceria may also provide adsorbed oxygen species that can spill over from the support to the metal particles, the re- duced Ce3+ being subsequently reoxidized by gaseous oxygen:2Ce4+ + O2+ 2Ce3+ + O,2Ce3+ + 1/2O2 2Ce4+ + O2.
Accordingly, the ceria supported catalyst could par- ticipate in the CO oxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen by the reducible ceria as mentioned pre- viously. However, synthesized CeO2 exhibited a sub- stantial increase in activity. The results obtained in this experiment suggest that this could be due to the differ- ences in CeO2 crystallite size, surface area of the cat- alyst and the support. The higher activity of 1% (1:1) PtPd/CeO2 (solgel) than % (1:1) PtPd/CeO2 (com- mercial) is also attributed to the higher metal dispersion on the surface of catalyst. From the comparisons done under this condition, the synthesized CeO2 was chosen as the support for studying the effect of catalyst ratio.
3.2.2. Effect of catalyst ratio
Five different loaded catalysts were investigated for the CO oxidation activity as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The effect of Pd contents (Pt: Pd = 1: 1, 1: 3, 1: 5, 1: 7, 1: 9) with about 1% wt. total metal loading on PtPd/CeO2 catalysts was examined as a function of temperature in the fuel stream (1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 bal- ance in helium). Fig. 4 representing the CO conversions at various reaction temperatures show the need of Pd to

The catalytic activ- ity was obviously increased with the increasing content of Pd. However, the results at a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 9 evidenced that it was not necessary to load Pd in very high loadings. The catalyst with a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 7 showed the best performance, 76% CO conversion and 55% selectivity and at 90.110 C. Moreover, the max- imum CO conversion temperature shows much larger shifts in peak position, as shifted down from 130 C of a ratio of Pt: Pd = 1: 1 to 90.110 C. That would be expected with a particle size effect. Therefore, Pd with an atomic ratio of 7 is suggested to be optimum load- ing for PtPd/CeO2 catalyst and was chosen to be the appropriate ratio for the further experiment.
In general, crystallite size is an important factor that affects the activity and selectivity of catalysts.

In addition, Pt and Pd were found to be homogeneous and well dispersed on the support material, as there is evidence of its presence in either EDS or TEM. Narui et al.

Fig. 6 shows the influence of oxygen concentration on the catalytic performance of PtPd/CeO2 catalysts.
The CO conversion significantly increased with an increased O2 concentration. As expected, at stoichio- metric O2 concentration (0.5% O2) the maximum attainable conversion was 60% at temperature range of 70.110 C.

Ninty nine percent CO conversion of 1% CO at 90 C can be achieved by increasing the oxygen concentration to 2%. As a result, the selectivity towards CO oxidation decreases as the oxygen concen- tration increases and were in the order of 44%, 55% and 57% for 2, 1 and 0.5% O2 concentrations, respec- tively, at the maximum CO conversion. This result is in agreement with the results obtained by our group on Au/CeO2 catalysts [9].
3.2.4. Effect of H2O concentration
The influence of water vapor has been studied by adding 10% of water to the feed stream. Fig. 7 shows the changes in CO conversion and selectivity of PtPd/CeO2 as a function of temperature. An en- hancement of CO oxidation reaction can be apparently observed when adding 10% water vapor in the feed.
At 90 C, when there was no water vapor in the feed stream the CO conversion was about 76% and when adding 10% water vapor in the feed stream the CO con- version was increased to 85%. In addition, the activity was increased over the whole temperature range from 50 to 190 C. A number of explanations have been pro- posed for the enhancement of activity in the presence of water. One was that water enhances the water gas shift reaction and as a result more CO was converted into CO2, the second possibility was that the hydroxyl group formed on the catalyst upon adsorption of water 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 CO conversion/Selectivity(%) Temperature (C) Fig. 8.

In addition,it has been reported that the bimetallic PdPt is less sensitive to water in the process steam compared with monometallic Pd catalysts [19].
3.2.5. Effect of CO2
It is crucial to know how this catalyst performs with the certain amounts of CO2 in the feed because in re- ality, the gas stream which is produced from reformer and water gas shift reactors contain about 2025% CO2.Therefore, the effect of CO2 concentration (4% and 25%) on the activity of PtPd/CeO2 catalyst is shown in Fig. 8. The CO conversion substantially dropped from 76% to 50% at 90.110 C when increasing CO2 con- centration in the feed stream. The presence of CO2 also affected the selectivity in the temperature range of
50.190 C. There are three possible explanations for the
effect of CO2. One was that the reverse water gas shift reaction takes place and hence lowers the reaction rate for the CO removal. The second was the formation of carbonate species over CeO2 sites. There was a slight possibility of the impregnation on solgel catalysts, the interface between ceria and platinumpalladium crys- tallites contain mobile oxygen which was blocked by CO2 adsorbing on the same sites. The other plausible explanation was that at low temperature dissociation of 1948

CO2 on PtPd yields a higher effective CO concentra- tion on the catalyst surface and, thus, reduced the rate of oxidation as the reverse water gas shift reaction [20,21].
3.2.6. Effect of the presence of both H2O and CO2
As already discussed, both 10% water and 25% CO2 were fed in the feed and observed the performance of this catalyst as shown in Fig. 9. Although the presence of water promoted a significant increase in the CO ox- idation activity and CO2 in the feed retarded the CO oxidation reaction, the combination of water and CO2 increased both the CO conversion and selectivity from 76% to 83% and from 55% to 60%, respectively, at about 90 C. In addition, the positive effect of water was more pronounced than the negative effect of CO2 in the feed over the temperature range. As compared to Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of water in the feed enhances the CO oxidation rate [6,22].
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this work was achieved for solgel ce- ria by attempting a urea gelation synthesis. Among the various PtPd/CeO2 catalysts having different Pt/Pd ra- tios, the 1% (1:7) PtPd/CeO2 (solgel) had the highest activity (76% CO conversion) at 90.110 C under the condition of 1% CO, 1% O2, 4% CO2, 40% H2 and He as balance. The maximum CO conversion of 99% was obtained at 90 C when increasing O2 concentra- tion to 2%. The addition of water vapor to the feed had a well-noted positive effect. It reduced the activation energy for both CO oxidation and hydrogen oxidation and thus resulted in an increased conversion and se- lectivity. The increased CO2 concentration in the feed stream reduced the conversion and selectivity of CO.
Our stability results of PtPd/CeO2 catalyst at the re- action temperature of 90 C during 24 h showed the high stability of this catalyst. However, multi-stage re- actor is needed to lower the CO concentration below 10100 ppm for PEMFC systems.
