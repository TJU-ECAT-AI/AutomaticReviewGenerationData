1.The literature does not provide specific information on how bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, influence the mechanisms and efficiencies of CO oxidation, water gas shift reaction, and methane conversions in reactor studies. However, it does mention that the watergas-shift reaction (WGS reaction) over PtRe/TiO2 and PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was studied, and the activity of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts was strongly affected by the Re content, while the activity of PtRe/TiO2 catalysts was less dependent on the addition ratio of Re, and more dependent on the temperature of reduction. The formation of certain bimetallic clusters between Pt and Re or Pd and Re was confirmed in the cases of PtRe(2:3) and PdRe(1:1)/TiO2 catalysts. The FT-IR analyses of the adsorbed species during the reaction exhibited the enhancement of the adsorbed CO peaks in lower wavenumber region with the increase of Re content. Accordingly, Re is supposed to have some effect on these adsorbed CO, which accelerates the WGS reaction, especially in the case of PdRe/TiO2 catalysts. Future UHV studies could potentially provide insights into correlating these findings with model surfaces and supported catalysts, considering the current limitations in UHV studies on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于双金属催化剂,特别是基于Pt的催化剂,如何影响CO氧化、水煤气转换反应和甲烷转换在反应器研究中的机制和效率。但是,它确实提到水煤气转换反应(WGS反应)在PtRe/TiO2和PdRe/TiO2催化剂上的研究,并且PdRe/TiO2催化剂的活性强烈受到Re含量的影响,而PtRe/TiO2催化剂的活性对Re添加比例的依赖性较小,更多依赖于还原温度。在PtRe(2:3)和PdRe(1:1)/TiO2催化剂的情况下,确认了Pt和Re或Pd和Re之间的某些双金属簇的形成。反应期间吸附物种的FT-IR分析显示,随着Re含量的增加,较低波数区域的吸附CO峰增强。因此,Re被认为对这些吸附的CO有一些影响,这加速了WGS反应,特别是在PdRe/TiO2催化剂的情况下。未来的UHV研究可能提供将这些发现与模型表面和支撑催化剂相关联的见解,考虑到目前在基于Pt的双金属表面上的UHV研究的限制。
