[1] "The performance of a Co-Pt powder and of Co-Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and on the graphite-like carbon material Sibunit in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered."
[2] "As compared to their Pt and Co monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and allow the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures to be reduced from 1 to 103 vol %."
[3] "This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface."

1.The performance of Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts in selective CO oxidation in hydrogen-containing mixtures is considered. Compared to their monometallic counterparts, the bimetallic catalysts are more active and can significantly reduce the CO concentration in hydrogen-containing mixtures. This effect is likely due to the formation of bimetallic particles of a Co-Pt solid solution on the support surface.

1.考虑了Co-Pt双金属催化剂在氢气混合物中选择性CO氧化的性能。与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂活性更高，可以显著降低氢气混合物中的CO浓度。这种效应可能归因于在支撑表面上形成Co-Pt双金属固体溶液的颗粒。
