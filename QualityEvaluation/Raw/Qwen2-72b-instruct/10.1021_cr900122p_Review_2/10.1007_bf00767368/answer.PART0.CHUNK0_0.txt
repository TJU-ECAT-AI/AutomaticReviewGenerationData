1.The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources, but it is also a great challenge for catalysis science. The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane.

1.将甲烷催化转化为所需的化学产品或液体燃料是利用天然气资源的一种有前途的方法，但对催化科学来说也是一个巨大的挑战。Mo改性的ZSM-5催化剂在973 K的非氧化条件下，对甲烷转化为苯显示出优异的催化活性和选择性。Mo或Zn在ZSM-5中的负载在甲烷活化中起着重要作用。随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产量也随之增加。
