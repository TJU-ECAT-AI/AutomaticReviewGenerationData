1.The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

1.将甲烷催化转化为所需的化学产品或液体燃料是利用天然气资源的有前途的方法，也是催化科学的重大挑战。Mo改性的ZSM-5催化剂在973 K的非氧化条件下，对甲烷转化为苯显示出优异的催化活性和选择性。在ZSM-5中加载的Mo或Zn在甲烷活化中起着重要作用。随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产量增加。这些因素促成了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。
