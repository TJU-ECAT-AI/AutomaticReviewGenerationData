1.The catalytic conversion of methane into desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising method for utilizing natural gas resources, but it also poses a significant challenge to catalysis science. The Mo-modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the conversion of methane to benzene at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a crucial role in the activation of methane. The yield of benzene increases with the increase in the partial pressure of methane. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

1.将甲烷催化转化为所需的化学产品或液体燃料是利用天然气资源的一种有前景的方法，但同时也对催化科学构成了重大挑战。Mo改性的ZSM-5催化剂在973 K的非氧化条件下，对甲烷转化为苯显示出优异的催化活性和选择性。在ZSM-5中加入Mo或Zn对甲烷的活化起着关键作用。随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产率也随之增加。这些因素促成了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。
