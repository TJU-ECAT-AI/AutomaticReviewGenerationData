1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation, and the Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
