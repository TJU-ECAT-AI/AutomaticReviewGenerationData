[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
[2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differences in shape were observed for all the samples."
[4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
[5] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
[6] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
[7] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
[8] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
[9] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
[10] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C. The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5 with different Si/Fe molar ratios and forms (sodium or hydrogen), influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, including atmospheric pressure and temperature range of 350-650 8C, also play a significant role. The catalysts consist of spherulitic aggregates, and the XRD patterns show typical lines for ZSM-5 zeolites, with line intensities varying with Fe content. Increasing the iron content in the catalysts leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves increases the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst of lower iron content. Temperature and contact time have a direct impact on methane conversion and the selectivity of oxidation to methanol, with higher temperatures and longer contact times reducing selectivity. Methanol production over Fe-ZSM-5 occurs at lower temperatures, with higher temperatures leading to its oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如具有不同Si/Fe摩尔比和形式(钠或氢)的Fe-ZSM-5,影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。反应条件,包括大气压和350-650 8C的温度范围,也起着重要作用。催化剂由球状聚集体组成,XRD图案显示典型的ZSM-5沸石线,线强度随Fe含量变化。增加催化剂中的铁含量会导致更高的甲烷转化率,而分子筛的钠形式会增加甲烷氧化到含氧化合物的选择性。甲烷到甲醇氧化的最高选择性是在铁含量较低的催化剂上实现的。温度和接触时间直接影响甲烷转化率和氧化到甲醇的选择性,更高的温度和更长的接触时间会降低选择性。在较低温度下,Fe-ZSM-5上会发生甲醇生产,而较高温度会导致其氧化为甲醛和二氧化碳。
