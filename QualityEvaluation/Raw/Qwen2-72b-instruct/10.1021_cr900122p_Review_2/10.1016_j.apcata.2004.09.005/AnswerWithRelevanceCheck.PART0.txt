          [1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
          [2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
          [3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differences in shape were observed for all the samples."
          [4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
          [5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
          [6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
          [7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
          [8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
          [9] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
          [10] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
          [11] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C."
          [12] "The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
          [13] "If Fe-HZSM-5 is applied, the oxidation of methane to methanol and to carbon dioxide follow the same speed pattern. Next, methanol slowly oxidises to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
          [14] "If Fe-NaZSM-5 has been used as a catalyst, then the methanol producing reaction is much faster than that carbon dioxide generating. However, methanol oxidises to for- maldehyde and then to carbon dioxide more rapidly than in the case of the reaction with Fe-HZSM-5 applied as a catalyst."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如Fe-ZSM-5，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。催化剂中的Si/Fe摩尔比影响甲烷转化率，铁含量较高时转化率较高。催化剂的钠形式增加了甲烷氧化为含氧化合物的选择性。催化剂中存在铁影响X射线衍射图案中的线强度，表明其被纳入框架中。催化剂以球状聚集体的形式存在，铁含量影响XRD图案中的线强度。这些过程中使用的催化剂通常是具有特定结构的沸石，如ZSM-5，可以将金属离子纳入其框架中。较高的温度和较长的接触时间导致甲醇生产的选择性降低，因为甲醇进一步氧化为甲醛和二氧化碳。这些过程中使用的催化剂通常是具有特定结构的沸石，如ZSM-5，可以将金属离子纳入其框架中。然而，这些过程的效率受到催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的影响，必须优化以获得最大产量和选择性。
