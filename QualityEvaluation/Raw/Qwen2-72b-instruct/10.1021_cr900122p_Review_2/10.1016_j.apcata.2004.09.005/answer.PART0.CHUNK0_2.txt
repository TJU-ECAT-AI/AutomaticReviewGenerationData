[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
[2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differences in shape were observed for all the samples."
[4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
[5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
[6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
[7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
[8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
[9] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
[10] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
[11] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C."
[12] "The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如Fe-ZSM-5,影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。Si/Fe摩尔比、Fe-ZSM-5的形式(钠或氢)以及温度和接触时间都影响甲烷转化为甲醇和二氧化碳。Fe-ZSM-5的结构,由球状聚集体和ZSM-5的典型XRD模式表征,表明Fe(III)被纳入框架位点。铁含量的增加导致更高的甲烷转化率,而分子筛的钠形式提高了甲烷氧化为氧化物的选择性。甲烷到甲醇氧化的最高选择性是在含有最低铁含量的催化剂上实现的。更高的温度和更长的接触时间增加了甲烷转化率,但降低了甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性。在较低温度下产生甲醇,但其浓度在较高温度下由于进一步氧化为甲醛和二氧化碳而降低。
