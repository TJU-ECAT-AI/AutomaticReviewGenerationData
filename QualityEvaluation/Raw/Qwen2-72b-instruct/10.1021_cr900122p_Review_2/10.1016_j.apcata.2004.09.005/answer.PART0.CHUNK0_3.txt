[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
[2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differ- ences in shape were observed for all the samples."
[4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
[5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
[6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
[7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
[8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
[9] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
[10] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
[11] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C."
[12] "The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
[13] "Increasing the iron content in molecular sieves leads to the rise of the catalyst activity, and furthermore, to the increase of methane conversion. However, it is also conducive to its intense oxidation to carbon dioxide."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio in the catalysts affects the methane conversion, with higher iron content leading to higher conversion rates. The sodium form of the catalysts increases the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, also impact the selectivity and conversion rates. Higher temperatures and longer contact times result in lower selectivity for methanol production due to its further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide. The catalysts used in these processes are typically zeolites with a specific structure, such as ZSM-5, which can incorporate metal ions into their framework. The presence of iron in the catalysts affects the line intensities in X-ray diffraction patterns, indicating its incorporation into the framework. The catalysts are in the form of spherulitic aggregates, and the iron content affects the line intensities in XRD patterns. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert methane to methanol and other oxygenates, which are valuable chemical feedstocks. However, the efficiency of these processes is influenced by the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions, which must be optimized for maximum yield and selectivity.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如Fe-ZSM-5，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。催化剂中的Si/Fe摩尔比影响甲烷转化率，铁含量较高时转化率较高。催化剂的钠形式增加了甲烷氧化为含氧化合物的选择性。反应条件，如温度和接触时间，也影响选择性和转化率。较高的温度和较长的接触时间导致甲醇生产的选择性降低，因为甲醇进一步氧化为甲醛和二氧化碳。这些过程中使用的催化剂通常是具有特定结构的沸石，如ZSM-5，可以将金属离子纳入其框架中。催化剂中存在铁影响X射线衍射图案中的线强度，表明其被纳入框架中。催化剂以球状聚集体的形式存在，铁含量影响XRD图案中的线强度。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够将甲烷转化为甲醇和其他含氧化合物，这些是宝贵的化学原料。然而，这些过程的效率受到催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的影响，必须优化以获得最大产量和选择性。
