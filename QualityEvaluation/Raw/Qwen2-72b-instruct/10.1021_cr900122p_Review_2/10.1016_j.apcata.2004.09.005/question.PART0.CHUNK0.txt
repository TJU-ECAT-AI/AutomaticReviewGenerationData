Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen over Fe-ZSM-5 Beata Michalkiewicz* Institute of Chemical and Environment Engineering, Technical University of Szczecin, ul. Pulaskiego 10, 70-322 Szczecin, Poland Received 5 February 2004; received in revised form 16 July 2004; accepted 6 September 2004 Abstract Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen has been investigated. The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form. Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45). It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol. The influence of the iron content on the kinetics of the carried out reactions was discussed.

1. Introduction
Partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates is one of the most attractive potential technologies of natural gas exploitation. At present this valuable raw material finds its use in burning with a view to generating energy. As a raw material in the chemical industry, methane is processed to synthesis gas and further on to methanol or formaldehyde.
Unfortunately, methane steam reforming is a highly endothermic process, thus also expensive. No wonder, the process of direct methane oxidation to oxygenates excluding the synthesis gas generating stage, has been researched all over the world. Such a process can be conducted at the atmospheric pressure at the temperature 350650 8C, using oxygen as an oxidising agent. Several different compounds,particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]. While the process was conducted at the atmospheric pressure,formaldehyde was usually obtained, however, as it has been pointed out in several publications, employing the right catalysts, may result in obtaining methanol [2,3,9].
Methane monooxygenaze (MMO) in methanotrophic bacteria catalyses the selective oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH by oxygen under ambient conditions [10]. The m-oxo- bridged binuclear iron centres in MMO are believed to be active sites for the catalytic reaction. There are a few attempts to mimic these biological systems using iron complex stabilized in a zeolite matrix [11,12].
Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism. In situ Mossbauer studies implicate the reduction of FeIII to FeII in stoichiometric reaction by oxidant on these catalysts [15,16].

Despite the fact that the hitherto described process has been researched for a number of years by many scientists, no satisfactory results have been received.
My research regarded oxidation of methane by oxygen under the atmospheric pressure conditions. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon framework only were employed as the process catalysts. The aim of my research was to determine the influence of the iron content,temperature and the contact time on the catalysts activity and the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts characterisation
Chemical composition of the catalysts was determined by means an ICP spectrometer JY 238 ULTRACE (Jobin Yvon). The samples were decomposed by microwave heating in aqueous HF solution.
X-ray power diffraction patterns of the zeolites were recorded from 2u = 58 to 708 on a XPert PRO (Philips) diffractometer using Co Ka radiation at a step size of 0.058.
Electronmicrographswere obtained with a Zeiss DSM 962.
To determine the pore volumes, N2 sorption isotherms were found at 196 8C, using a Micrometritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Samples were previously evacuated at 350 8C for 16 h. The BET method was used to calculate the surface area (SBET) of the samples, while the micropore volume (Vmicro) and was determined using the t-plot method.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Metallosilicates with the ZSM-5 structure were prepared.
Their framework did not contain any aluminium but iron and silicon only. The molar ratio of silicon to iron (Si/Fe) was 45,34 and 22. In order to obtain these, two solutions were prepared: Aferric nitrate (III) in the 20% sulphuric acid and Bsilicon dioxide in the 10% sodium hydroxide.
Solution B was administered into the A solution in the form of drops while being mixed thoroughly. Thus, a gel-like mixture was arrived at. Next tetrapropyloamino bromide and sodium chloride were fed into the mixture. It was then loaded into an autoclave. The crystallization process was carried out at the temperature 180 8C for 2 h. Thus acquired powder was then dried at the temperature 150 8C for 5 h and calcinated at the temperature 500 8C in the nitrogen stream for 4 h. This is how molecular sieves in the sodium form (Fe- NaZSM-5) were formed. The hydrogen form (Fe-HZSM-5) was arrived at by washing sodium ions with the solution of ammonium nitrate at the temperature 70 8C and completed within 4 h. The washing process was repeated three times.
The received preparation was dried and calcinated as before.
2.3. Catalytic measurements
The reaction was carried out in the vertical flow reactor containing a catalyst.
A
schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Methane (1) and oxygen (2) were supplied from the gas cylinders equipped with micrometric valves (3). Both reagents were passed through the columns with the molecular sieves 5A in order to remove the moisture (4). Methane was sampling through the membrane (5) for analysis. The flow rates of gases were measured using flowmeters (6). The mixing of reagents was performed in a mixer (7). The mixture was sampled through the membrane (8) for analyses. The reagents were passed by valve (9) to the quartz reactor (10) of an inside diameter 11 mm. The catalyst bed (11) was placed on the grate from quartz wool. The reactor was heated by a resistance furnace (12). The measurement and control of temperature was ensured by the system: a thermocouple FeCuNi (13) and temperature regulator with a digital meter (14). For the collection of the liquid fraction was used a receiver (15). The gas products were sampled through the membrane (16) and directed to ventilation (17). Oxygen which comprised 15.5% of the reaction mixture volume, was used as an oxidant. The reaction was held at the temperature 350650 8C. The contact time was changed from 0.5 to 2.5 s.
The following products were expected as a result of methane oxidation: methanol, formaldehyde, carbon oxides and water. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed for the following compounds: methane and light hydrocarbons (C2H6, C2H4, C2H2), oxygen, nitrogen, water,carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methanol, and formalde- hyde.
The composition of products mixture was determined chromatographically using a Fisons apparatus equipped with katharometer with hydrogen as a carrier gas in the following way: Methane, and other hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, water,methanol, carbon dioxideon a column 1 m, f = 3 mm,packed with Porapak T (Supelco) working with the utilization of temperature programme from 40 to 120 8C.
Carbon monoxide, methane, oxygen, nitrogenon a column 1 m, f = 3 mm, packed with molecular sieves 5A working at a temperature of 40 8C.
Only methanol, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide and water were found as products.
Carbon monoxide and
C2
hydrocarbons were not found in the post-reaction mixture.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterisation
In Figs. 2 and 3 the XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of

148 prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content. The decreases of the intensities correlate with the increasing Fe content of the samples.
There are no diffraction lines at 2u = 38.69 or 41.64, which are the strong lines of hematite. No evidence of any other phase besides ZSM-5 was found on all the samples. The XRD powder patterns of the Fe-NaZSM-5 are similar.
The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. For Fe-ZSM-5(22) (the highest concentration of Fe) the splitting is not observed.
Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differ- ences in shape were observed for all the samples. Fig. 4 shows the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) picture.
Table 1 shows BET surface and micropore volume data of Fe-ZSM-5. All the Fe-NaZSM-5 samples show the similar pore volume (0.11 cm3/g). For Fe-HZSM-5 the pore

This fact leads to the conclusion that Fe species are mainly in framework posi- tions. There is no the pore blocking effect of the precipitated iron. This is supported by XRD investigations (a hematite phase was not found). Moreover, the catalysts were the same color (white) independent on the Fe content.
3.2. Methane oxidation over various Fe-ZSM-5
Ferrisilicates molecular sieves with the structure of ZSM- 5 zeolite were used as catalysts. They differed in the amount of iron in the framework. The sodium and hydrogen form of the molecular sieves was employed. Methane conversion over Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts turned out to exceed the one over the Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts, which had the same iron content.
Table 2 presents the highest values of methane conversion achieved over Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts differing in various iron content and selectivity values, respectively.
The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates displayed a slight grow along with the drop of the iron content, while the selectivity of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide was falling.
Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates. The highest acquired selectivity values of the oxidation of methane to methanol and the related values of methane conversion are displayed in Table 3.
The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered. It is worth mentioning that the maximum values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol show little difference for all Fe- NaZSM-5 catalysts. With such high selectivity values,methane conversion shows little conversion features.
3.3. The influence of contact time and temperature on
methane conversion Fig. 5 presents the interrelation between the methane conversion and the temperature for each of the studied catalysts. The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion. The methane conversion values for the molecular sieves in the hydrogen form exceed the ones in the sodium one, displaying the same iron content. The contact time in the mentioned case was 1.5 s but the course of the curves and their mutual arrangement is the same as in the case of other values of the contact time. The changes of methane conversion while the contact time at the temperature 550 8C is extended are presented in Fig. 6.
When all the molecular sieves were examined within a scope of time, the methane conversion with a simultaneous extension of the contact time was observed. This depen- dency was linear for each of the used catalysts. The figures demonstrating the changes of methane conversion with the contact time for other temperatures being extended look similar.

3.4. The influence of the process parameters on the
selectivity of the oxidation of methane to products The contact time (Fig. 7) and the temperature (Fig. 8) influence on the selectivity of oxidation of methane to methanol over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts were analyzed. Extend- ing the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts.
Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature
350 8C.
The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide. Even at 650 8C methanol was observed but not much. A few attempts were made with an empty reactor. It these cases methanol was not produced. So methanol is formed heterogeneously only when catalyst Fe-ZSM-5 is present. Also Kudo and Ono [3] reported that methane was converted to methanol at temperature 600700 8C using ZSM-5 catalyst.
Fe-NaZSM-5 catalyst with the lowest iron content proved to act differently, as at the temperature of 400 8C it demonstrated lower selectivity of the oxidation of methane

Fig. 9 shows the interrelation between the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to particular products and the methane conversion for Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts with the contact time 1 and 2 s. The increase of conversion marks the drop in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol, whereas the one of carbon dioxide oxidation grows. With the contact time of 1 s, the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde slightly rises, and next drops. When the contact time was 2 s, an insignificant fall of the selectivity of oxidation to formaldehyde was observed. The increase of the amount of iron in the catalyst resulted in the situation that the border where carbon dioxide was the main product, was moving towards the lowest values of methane conversion. Also, the contact time entailed moving this border towards the lower degrees of methane conversion. Methanol was the main ingredient of the post- reaction mixture to the 1.6% conversion value for the Fe- NaZSM-5 catalyst with the lowest content of iron and the 1 s contact time. With the catalyst having the highest iron content and the contact time 2 s, carbon dioxide appeared as the dominant product, even when methane conversion showed the lowest values.
Fig. 10 demonstrates the interrelation between the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to products and methane conversion for 1 and 2 s contact time for Fe-HZSM- 5 catalysts. Carbon dioxide is the main reaction product with the contact time 1 and 2 s when Fe-HZSM-5 are used as catalysts. Increasing methane conversion results in the fall of the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol, the selectivity of oxidation to carbon dioxide increase and an insignificant rise of the selectivity of oxidation to formalde- hyde. When the contact time for the catalysts with a higher content of iron was 2 s, methane conversion was followed by a minor drop for formaldehyde content in the products.
3.5. Summary
Methanol and carbon dioxide are the original products of the reaction. Formaldehyde is the result of methanol oxidation. Additional quantities of carbon dioxide appear after formaldehyde oxidation. Thus the following reactions take place:
CH4  0:5O2 ! CH3OH

CH4  2O2 ! CO2  2H2O
(2)
CH3OH  0:5O2 ! HCHO  H2O

(4) If Fe-HZSM-5 is applied, the oxidation of methane to methanol and to carbon dioxide follow the same speed pattern. Next, methanol slowly oxidises to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide.
If Fe-NaZSM-5 has been used as a catalyst, then the methanol producing reaction is much faster than that carbon dioxide generating. However, methanol oxidises to for- maldehyde and then to carbon dioxide more rapidly than in the case of the reaction with Fe-HZSM-5 applied as a catalyst.
Increasing the iron content in molecular sieves leads to the rise of the catalyst activity, and furthermore, to the increase of methane conversion. However, it is also conducive to its intense oxidation to carbon dioxide.
