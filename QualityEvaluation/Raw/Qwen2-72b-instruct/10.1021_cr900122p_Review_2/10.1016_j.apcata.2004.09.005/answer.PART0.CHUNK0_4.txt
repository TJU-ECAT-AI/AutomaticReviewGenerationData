[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
[2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differences in shape were observed for all the samples."
[4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
[5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
[6] "Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."
[7] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of the catalyst (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time of the reaction all play a role in the selectivity and conversion of methane to methanol and other products. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5 zeolites, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol is higher when Fe-NaZSM-5 is used, and increasing the temperature and contact time increases methane conversion but decreases selectivity.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如Fe-ZSM-5,影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。Si/Fe摩尔比、催化剂形式(钠或氢)以及反应的温度和接触时间都在甲烷选择性转化为甲醇和其他产物中发挥作用。Fe-ZSM-5的结构,由球状聚集体和ZSM-5沸石的典型XRD图案表征,表明Fe(III)被纳入框架位点。当使用Fe-NaZSM-5时,甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性更高,而增加温度和接触时间会增加甲烷转化率,但会降低选择性。
