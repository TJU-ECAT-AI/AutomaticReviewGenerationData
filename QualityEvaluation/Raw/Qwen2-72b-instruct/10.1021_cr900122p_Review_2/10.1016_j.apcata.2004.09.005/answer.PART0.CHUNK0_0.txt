[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
[2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
[3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differ- ences in shape were observed for all the samples."
[4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
[5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
[6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
[7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
[8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
[9] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
[10] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
[11] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C."
[12] "The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
[13] "If Fe-HZSM-5 is applied, the oxidation of methane to methanol and to carbon dioxide follow the same speed pattern. Next, methanol slowly oxidises to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
[14] "If Fe-NaZSM-5 has been used as a catalyst, then the methanol producing reaction is much faster than that carbon dioxide generating. However, methanol oxidises to for- maldehyde and then to carbon dioxide more rapidly than in the case of the reaction with Fe-HZSM-5 applied as a catalyst."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, play a significant role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of the catalyst (sodium or hydrogen), and the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites influence the catalytic activity. The reaction conditions, including temperature and contact time, also affect the selectivity and conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The catalysts' structure, such as spherulitic aggregates, and the intensity of XRD lines, which vary with Fe content, contribute to their industrial significance in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Increasing the iron content in molecular sieves leads to higher methane conversion, but it also results in more intense oxidation to carbon dioxide. The sodium form of molecular sieves leads to higher selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates, and a catalyst with a lower iron content achieves higher selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation. The temperature and contact time have a significant impact on the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol, with higher temperatures and longer contact times leading to lower selectivity. Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at lower temperatures, but as the temperature increases, methanol concentration decreases due to its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide. The speed pattern of methane oxidation to methanol and carbon dioxide differs between Fe-HZSM-5 and Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts, with Fe-NaZSM-5 leading to faster methanol production and more rapid oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如Fe-ZSM-5,在烷烃转化的机制和效率中起着重要作用。Si/Fe摩尔比、催化剂形式(钠或氢)以及Fe(III)在框架位点的掺入影响催化活性。反应条件,包括温度和接触时间,也影响甲烷转化为甲醇和二氧化碳的选择性和转化率。催化剂的结构,如球状聚集体,以及XRD线的强度,随Fe含量的变化,对它们在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的工业意义有贡献。在分子筛中增加铁含量会导致更高的甲烷转化率,但也会导致更强烈的氧化为二氧化碳。钠形式的分子筛导致甲烷氧化为含氧化合物的选择性更高,铁含量较低的催化剂实现了甲醇氧化的甲烷选择性更高。温度和接触时间对甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性有重大影响,更高的温度和更长的接触时间导致选择性降低。在较低温度下,Fe-ZSM-5上产生甲醇,但随着温度的升高,由于甲醇氧化为甲醛,然后氧化为二氧化碳,甲醇浓度降低。Fe-HZSM-5和Fe-NaZSM-5催化剂的甲烷氧化为甲醇和二氧化碳的速度模式不同,Fe-NaZSM-5导致更快的甲醇生产,甲醛和二氧化碳的氧化更迅速。
