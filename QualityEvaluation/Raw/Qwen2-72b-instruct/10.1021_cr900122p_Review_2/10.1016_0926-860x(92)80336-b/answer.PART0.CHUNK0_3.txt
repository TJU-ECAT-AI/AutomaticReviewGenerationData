[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
[2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
[3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
[4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
[5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
[6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
[7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
[8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
[9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
[10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
[11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
[12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
[13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
[14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
[15] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
[16] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
[17] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

1.The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts significantly influence the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is active for propane aromatization. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as those reoxidized by air or traces of oxygen in inert gases. The reoxidation generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for ethane aromatization. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The selectivity to aromatics and methane can be significantly improved by pretreatments. The addition of small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium can also enhance the yield of aromatics.

1.镓的状态和镓/ZSM-5催化剂的预处理显著影响芳构化活性。在ZSM-5中离子交换的镓可以被还原为Ga+，这在丙烷芳构化中是活性的。然而，对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如通过空气或惰性气体中的微量氧气再氧化的催化剂活性和选择性高。再氧化生成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这在乙烷芳构化中是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的反应条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。镓在沸石通道内的分散和氧化态极大地影响烷烃脱氢和水裂的相对速率。预处理可以显著提高对芳烃和甲烷的选择性。添加少量的铼、铂或铑也可以提高芳烃的产量。
