[1] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without addi- tional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
[2] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
[3] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
[4] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
[5] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
[6] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
[7] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
[8] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials Correspondence to: Dr. K.M.

[10] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
[11] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
[12] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
[13] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems.Conversions and aromatics selectivities for Ga/H-ZSM-5 cat- alysts are typically high in the temperature range at which reduction of Ga,O,readily occurs ( > 520 * C ) , even for catalysts prepared very differently;second- ary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
[14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
[15] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
[16] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
[17] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. Reduction generates dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels, but for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials which have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C does not regenerate Ga2O3, but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation, but can be reduced by hydrogen. The dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents problems, conversions and aromatics selectivities for Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are typically high in the temperature range at which reduction of Ga2O3 readily occurs, even for catalysts prepared very differently. Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed, and therefore coking is also a problem. In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance, various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane have been tested. For this probe reaction, differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. In order to give high yields to aromatics, rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。ZSM-5中通过离子交换的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。还原在沸石通道中生成分散的、活性的镓物种，但对乙烷脱氢生成芳烃而言，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过大量再氧化的材料活性和选择性高。在550C下再氧化不会再生Ga2O3，而是生成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这在从乙烷生产芳烃中是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢反应条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。镓在沸石通道内的分散和氧化态极大地影响烷烃脱氢和水裂的相对速率。作为Ga-沸石催化剂的测试反应，丙烷芳构化存在一些问题。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的转化率和芳烃选择性通常在Ga2O3容易发生还原的温度范围内很高，即使催化剂的制备方式非常不同。容易形成次级产物，如C a+芳烃，因此结焦也是一个问题。为了更清楚地区分各种预处理方法对催化剂性能的影响，已经测试了各种制备的Ga/ZSM-5用于乙烷的脱氢。对于这个探针反应，不同制备的MFI材料的催化性能差异往往很明显，特别是在它们对芳烃和甲烷的选择性上。为了获得高产率的芳烃，铼、铂或铑通常以少量添加到催化剂中。Ga2O3的还原对于在沸石中分散镓是必要的，但最活跃和选择性生产芳烃的催化剂形式并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。
