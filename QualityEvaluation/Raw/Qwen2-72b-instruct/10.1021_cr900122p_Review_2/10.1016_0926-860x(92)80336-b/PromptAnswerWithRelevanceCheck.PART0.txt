1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。ZSM-5中通过离子交换的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。还原在沸石通道中生成分散的、活性的镓物种，但对乙烷脱氢生成芳烃而言，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过大量再氧化的材料活性和选择性高。在550C下再氧化不会再生Ga2O3，而是生成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这在从乙烷生产芳烃中是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢反应条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。镓在沸石通道内的分散和氧化态极大地影响烷烃脱氢和水裂的相对速率。作为Ga-沸石催化剂的测试反应，丙烷芳构化存在一些问题。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的转化率和芳烃选择性通常在Ga2O3容易发生还原的温度范围内很高，即使催化剂的制备方式非常不同。容易形成次级产物，如C a+芳烃，因此结焦也是一个问题。为了更清楚地区分各种预处理方法对催化剂性能的影响，已经测试了各种制备的Ga/ZSM-5用于乙烷的脱氢。对于这个探针反应，不同制备的MFI材料的催化性能差异往往很明显，特别是在它们对芳烃和甲烷的选择性上。为了获得高产率的芳烃，铼、铂或铑通常以少量添加到催化剂中。Ga2O3的还原对于在沸石中分散镓是必要的，但最活跃和选择性生产芳烃的催化剂形式并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。

1.The state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts are influenced by pretreatments. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. An ion-exchanged, reduced catalyst has similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation occurs rapidly at 550C, but does not regenerate Ga203, instead forming a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for ethane aromatization. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen. The conclusion is based on observations that hydrogen pretreatment greatly improves selectivities and activities for aromatics production from propane, gallium does not insert into the zeolitic framework upon reduction, and hydrogen reduction of Ga203/H-ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga(NO3)/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials correlates with gallium reduction stoichiometry. The aim of the work is to demonstrate that gallium-exchanged materials fit into the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and that the most active and selective catalyst for aromatics production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

1.镓/ZSM-5催化剂的镓状态和芳构化活性受预处理的影响。ZSM-5离子交换中的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。离子交换和还原的催化剂具有相似的氧化还原行为，其丙烷芳构化的活性与Ga203和H-ZSM-5物理混合物制备的催化剂相当。然而，对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过充分再氧化的材料活性和选择性高。再氧化在550C下迅速发生，但不会再生Ga203，而是形成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这对乙烷芳构化是最优的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。结论基于以下观察：氢预处理极大地提高了从丙烷生产芳烃的选择性和活性，还原时镓不会插入到沸石框架中，Ga203/H-ZSM-5机械混合物和Ga(NO3)/H-ZSM-5浸渍材料的氢还原与镓还原的化学计量相关。工作的目的是证明镓交换材料符合镓还原的化学计量理论，并且最活跃和选择性最高的芳烃生产催化剂并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。

[7] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
[8] "The gallium content was 5.0 wt.-%."
[9] "The second material (denoted GaMFI ) was prepared beginning with two successive ion exchanges of 5 equivalents of Ga ( NOa )3 aqueous solution with HMFI, with slow heating to 500 C in flowing helium after exchanges."
[10] "A partly exchanged,partly me- chanically mixed material was then prepared by ball-milling some GaMFI for 3 h with 3.1 wt.-% Ga as /3-Ga203 to produce a material with a theoretical overall gallium content of ca. 5 wt.-% (denoted Ga/GaMFI)."
[11] "The XRD patterns in the range 28= 24-36 were used to determine roughly ( 5 0.2 wt.-% Ga based on repeat experiments on a physical mixture) the initial amounts of gallium asp-Ga,O, in Ga/ZSM-5 materials."
[12] "The sum of peak heights at 28 values of about 31.7 and 35.2 (b-Ga,O, lines) divided by the sum of peak heights at 28values of about 24.3 and 29.2 o (ZSM-5 lines) is proportional to the ratio /3-Ga,O,/ZSM-5 [ 21."
[13] "The maximum loading of exchanged gallium was therefore 1.7 wt.-% in GaMFI."
[14] "It is generally accepted that it is difficult to exchange trivalent ions into ZSM-5, because the lattice is relatively hydrophobic and the anion field is weak,precipitation of hydroxides and exchange of metal hydroxide ions such as [M (OH),] + cannot usually be avoided [ 141."
[15] "However,the XRD results indicated that as much as 75% of the gallium added during the exchange pro- cedure was amorphous even after calcination at 500C"
[16] "The final weight loss after reduction at 620C was 0.962 0.12% (Fig. 1 ), suggesting that [Ga(OH),] +Z- was present after drying,and that it was almost completely reduced by hydro- gen at 620C."
[17] "For Ga/GaMFI, according to the sichiomet of reactions (2)- (4)) p-Ga,O,was in slight excess, Z- limited the reaction, and we compute an expected weight loss of 1.61%,in fair agreement with the final weight loss actually ob- served (1.43 t 0.06%, Fig. 1)."
[18] "The activity and aromatics selectivity for the series of Ga/HMFI catalysts generally followed the order B (reduced/oxidized) > C (reduced/He ) > A (re- duced) > D (reduced/oxidized/reduced)."
[19] "The reoxidized Ga/HMFI was the best catalyst for ethane aromatization."
[20] "This finding is in qualitative agreement with previous results for n-butane aromatization with a reoxidized Ga/H-ZSM-5 [ 191, n-butane aromatization with oxygen addition to the feed [23], and propane aromatization after air regeneration of deactivated catalysts [ 8,241."
[21] "It is also in line with the finding that hydrogen uptake is quadrupled for an impregnated Ga/H-ZSM-5 after roughly 70% reoxidation at 450C [5], assuming the rate of associative de- sorption of hydrogen would be similarly enhanced."
[22] "The reoxidized Ga/HMFI exhibited aromatics yields comparable to those reported for materials with the cocatalysts rhenium, rhodium, or plating [ 12,131."
[23] "Characterization of Ga/MI XRD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calor- imetry (DSC! ) studies were undertaken to further examine the redox behavior of Ga/HMFI."
[24] "Using the XRD procedure outlined previously, the wt.-% Ga as P-Ga203 was determined; some example XRD data are shown in Fig. 4."
[25] "The j?-Ga203 line widths (31.7 and 35.2 ) were unchanged upon reduction, and the crystallite sizes were in excess of 300 A using the Scherrer equation."
[26] "There- fore the estimate of p-Gaz03 content in reduced Ga/HMFI-A should be accu- rate."
[27] "By this technique fresh Ga/HMFI-A contained 2.5 ?0.2%,fresh Ga/ HMFI-B 2.2%, and the used catalysts B and C contained 2.1-2.4% Ga as p- Ga,O,."
[28] "We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs."
[29] "However, the dispersed gallium created by the initial reduction with hydrogen was only slightly augmented by on-line reduction when using ethane feed, because the /3-Ga203 contents of freshly pretreated and used catalysts were similar."
[30] "Pretreatment C (inert gas at 550 C for 5 h after the standard reduction) of the reaction experiments was duplicated in the TGA and some of these data are shown in Fig. 5."
[31] "It is evident that reoxidation of Ga/HMFI was possible using trace amounts of oxygen (here ca. 100 ppm); 75% of the weight loss due to reduction was regained upon reoxidation for 5 h."
[32] "It is concluded that a sim- ilar phenomenon was largely responsible for the helium activation of Ga/ HMFI in the reaction experiments, although enhanced gallium dispersion may also play a role in any high-temperature gas treatment of gallium oxides."
[33] "Pro- longed ( > 12 h) inert gas treatment resulted in 94 + 4% weight regain."
[34] "The partly ion-exchanged GafGaMFI could also be almost completely (97 + 4% ) reoxidized at 550 C; however, as shown in Fig. 1, only about 70% of the gallium was rapidly reoxidized."
[35] "It can therefore be concluded that there was negligible loss of Ga,O in the pretreatments, which is undersble if the GaaO reacts immediately with the zeolite as proposed above (reaction (2) )."
[36] "In practice, even reoxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts may contain some gallium as framework cations (e.g., [ GaO ] + ), because the final stage of reoxidation is so slow."
[37] "Re-reduction with hydrogen of reoxidized material (simulating sample D, Fig. 2) gave the same weight loss as in the initial reduction, 1.44 ? 0.69% [ com- pare 1.78% for complete reduction according to reaction (2) 1; complete stoi- chiometric reduction was found to be possible only at higher temperature ( 620 C )."
[38] "The catalysts used in the ethane dehydrogenation experiments (Figs. 2 and 3) should therefore have been only partly reduced by the standard pretreatment; this is in agreement with the XRD results."
[39] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."
[40] "The sum of the heats of endothermic tran- sitions was ca. 58 mJ/mg."
[41] "For complete reduction offl-Ga,O, to Ga,O, the heat requirement would be 73 mJ/mg for this sample."
[42] "The actual heat of reduction should indeed be smaller than 73 mJ/mg, because the second step of the overall reduction [reaction (3) ] is: GazO+2H+Z-+2Ga+Z-+2H,O (5) This step is exothermic, as determined from thermodynamic calculations us- ing either gas phase or aqueous heats of formation for H+ and Ga+."
[43] "When aqueous phase values are used, for example, the overall heat of reduction ac- cording to reaction (2) was computed to be 49 mJ/mg."
[44] "Reoxidation in the DSC showed a much larger exothermic heat of transition,from 760 to 1050 mJ/mg, depending upon whether the sample was oxidized slowly (decrease temperature to 2OOC, purge, admit air, then increase tem- perature) or rapidly (decrease temperature to 55OC, purge, admit air, then isothermal)."
[45] "Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen; however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor."
[46] "This was especially true of the slow reoxidation experiment (Fig. 7), in which an additional exotherm at lower temperature probably corresponded to combustion of some of the ad- sorbed hydrogen; for air treatment of non-prereduced GaHMFI, the DSC showed only a very weak low-temperature exotherm (Fig. 7)."
[47] "We speculate that some of the excess heat was necessary to generate Ga,O, in a dispersed,amorphous form in the zeolite channels."
[48] "It was unlikely that (GaO) +Z- was the ultimate product of reoxidation, because the weight regains were too high;a 64% regain would correspond to formation of (GaO ) +Z- in Ga/HMFI, and 57-73% in Ga/GaMFI, while 9424 and 9754% regains were observed, re- spectively."
[49] "It is certainly possible that the rapid weight regains in the first few hours (75 and 70%, respectively) were associated with GaO+Z- formation,but the long-term results confirmed that Ga&, was the ultimate product of long-term reoxidation."
[50] "From the results of Figs. 1 and 5 we can conclude that reoxidation in the microreactor would not have been complete."
[51] "So the highly active and selective Ga/MFI-B probably included both gallium framework cations and extra- framework Ga,O,."
[52] "This may be a desirable combination for enhancing desorp- tion rates of hydrogen, and therefore rates of aromatization."
[53] "Uptakes of hy- drogen actually increased after short reductions of impregnated GafH-ZSM- 5 at 450C [ 51 and of a-GazO, at 300C [25]."
[54] "It is difficult to separate the effects of increased dispersion from change in oxidation state, but the second example in particular and our own data lead us to speculate that hydrogen desorption may be optimal with dispersed gallium oxide species whose average oxidation state is somewhat less than 3 + ."
[55] "CONCLUSIONS"
[56] "(1) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts contain Ga3+/Ga+ in the form of a redox pair."
[57] "The extent of reduction to Ga+ for catalysts prepared by both ion exchange and mechanical mixing techniques is limited by the availability of anionic lat- tice sites."
[58] "Reduction with hydrogen is typically incomplete (Ga+ /Z- < 1) at 575 C but complete at 620 o C."
[59] "(2 ) Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."
[60] "In real-world catalysts, some or all Ga3+ could be in the form of ( GaO ) + ions, because the ultimate product of reoxidation, dispersed Ga203, is formed very slowly at 550 C."
[61] "Reoxidized catalysts are stable under the reaction conditions used here (530-570 C, low hydrocarbon partial pressures), but are not stable to re-reduction by hydrogen at higher partial pressures."
[62] "(3) A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation."
[63] "Such catalysts also show lower hydrocrack- ing activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials, because of the reduction in Brnrnsted acidity associated with the transformation to Ga+Z- sites."
[64] "(4) TGA reduction studies suggest that [ Ga (OH),] + is the exchanging ion in ion-exchanged (from aqueous solution) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, and that these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen."
[65] "Reduced catalysts of this type are similar both in their catalytic and in their redox behavior to reduced cat- alysts prepared from mechanical mixtures of ZSM-5 and jI-Ga203."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. For ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized by air or traces of oxygen in inert gases. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ phase that is optimal for ethane aromatization. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen. The gallium content and the method of preparation, such as ion exchange or mechanical mixing, also affect the catalyst's performance. The XRD patterns can be used to determine the initial amounts of gallium as p-Ga,O, in Ga/ZSM-5 materials. The maximum loading of exchanged gallium is 1.7 wt.-% in GaMFI. It is difficult to exchange trivalent ions into ZSM-5 due to the hydrophobic lattice and weak anion field. As much as 75% of the gallium added during the exchange procedure is amorphous even after calcination at 500C. The final weight loss after reduction at 620C suggests that [Ga(OH),] +Z- was present after drying and was almost completely reduced by hydrogen at 620C. The reoxidized Ga/HMFI was the best catalyst for ethane aromatization, in agreement with previous results for n-butane aromatization with a reoxidized Ga/H-ZSM-5, n-butane aromatization with oxygen addition to the feed, and propane aromatization after air regeneration of deactivated catalysts. Hydrogen uptake is quadrupled for an impregnated Ga/H-ZSM-5 after roughly 70% reoxidation at 450C. The reoxidized Ga/HMFI exhibited aromatics yields comparable to those reported for materials with the cocatalysts rhenium, rhodium, or plating. XRD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were used to further examine the redox behavior of Ga/HMFI. The wt.-% Ga as p-Ga203 was determined using XRD, and the line widths of j?-Ga203 were unchanged upon reduction. The estimate of p-Ga203 content in reduced Ga/HMFI-A was accurate. The initial reduction was incomplete, and the reoxidation did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs. The dispersed gallium created by the initial reduction with hydrogen was only slightly augmented by on-line reduction when using ethane feed. Reoxidation of Ga/HMFI was possible using trace amounts of oxygen, and prolonged inert gas treatment resulted in a high weight regain. The partly ion-exchanged GafGaMFI could also be almost completely reoxidized at 550C. In practice, even reoxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts may contain some gallium as framework cations. Re-reduction with hydrogen of reoxidized material gave the same weight loss as in the initial reduction, and complete stoichiometric reduction was found to be possible only at higher temperature. The catalysts used in the ethane dehydrogenation experiments should have been only partly reduced by the standard pretreatment. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC, and the sum of the heats of endothermic transitions was ca. 58 mJ/mg. The actual heat of reduction was smaller than the calculated heat of reduction due to the exothermic second step of the overall reduction. Reoxidation in the DSC showed a much larger exothermic heat of transition, and some of the excess heat resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen. The excess heat was necessary to generate Ga,O, in a dispersed, amorphous form in the zeolite channels. It was unlikely that (GaO) +Z- was the ultimate product of reoxidation. The rapid weight regains in the first few hours were associated with GaO+Z- formation, but the long-term results confirmed that Ga&, was the ultimate product of long-term reoxidation. Reoxidation in the microreactor would not have been complete, and the highly active and selective Ga/MFI-B probably included both gallium framework cations and extra-framework Ga,O,. This combination may enhance desorption rates of hydrogen and therefore rates of aromatization. Hydrogen desorption may be optimal with dispersed gallium oxide species whose average oxidation state is somewhat less than 3+. Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts contain Ga3+/Ga+ in the form of a redox pair, and the extent of reduction to Ga+ is limited by the availability of anionic lattice sites. Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase. Reoxidized catalysts are stable under the reaction conditions used but are not stable to re-reduction by hydrogen at higher partial pressures. A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is less active and selective for aromatics formation and shows lower hydrocracking activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials due to the reduction in Brnrnsted acidity associated with the transformation to Ga+Z- sites. TGA reduction studies suggest that [Ga(OH),] + is the exchanging ion in ion-exchanged Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, and these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen. Reduced catalysts of this type are similar in their catalytic and redox behavior to reduced catalysts prepared from mechanical mixtures of ZSM-5 and jI-Ga203.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。ZSM-5中通过离子交换的镓可以被还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。对于乙烷脱氢转化为芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如通过空气或惰性气体中的微量氧气充分再氧化的材料活性和选择性高。在550°C下再氧化产生更高能量、分散的Ga3+相，这在乙烷芳构化中是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢气还原。镓含量和制备方法，如离子交换或机械混合，也影响催化剂的性能。XRD图案可用于确定Ga/ZSM-5材料中作为p-Ga,O的初始镓量。GaMFI中交换镓的最大负载量为1.7 wt.%。由于疏水性晶格和弱的阴离子场，很难将三价离子交换到ZSM-5中。即使在500°C下煅烧，交换过程中添加的高达75%的镓也是无定形的。620°C下还原后的最终重量损失表明，[Ga(OH),] +Z-在干燥后存在，并且在620°C下几乎完全被氢气还原。对于乙烷芳构化，再氧化的Ga/HMFI是最好的催化剂，这与之前关于通过再氧化的Ga/H-ZSM-5进行n-丁烷芳构化、向进料中添加氧气进行n-丁烷芳构化以及通过空气再生失活催化剂进行丙烷芳构化的结果一致。在大约70%的450°C再氧化后，浸渍的Ga/H-ZSM-5的氢气吸收量增加了四倍。再氧化的Ga/HMFI的芳烃产量与报道的含有铼、铑或镀层助催化剂的材料相当。XRD、热重分析(TGA)和差示扫描量热法(DSC)研究被用来进一步研究Ga/HMFI的氧化还原行为。使用XRD确定了wt.% Ga作为p-Ga203，而j?-Ga203的线宽在还原后没有变化。在还原的Ga/HMFI-A中p-Ga203含量的估计是准确的。最初的还原是不完全的，再氧化没有再生结晶的&GazOs。通过氢气初始还原产生的分散镓仅在使用乙烷进料时通过在线还原略有增强。使用微量氧气可以再氧化Ga/HMFI，而长时间的惰性气体处理导致了高重量恢复。部分离子交换的GafGaMFI也可以在550°C下几乎完全再氧化。实际上，即使再氧化的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂也可能含有一些作为晶格阳离子的镓。再还原再氧化材料与氢气给出的重量损失与初始还原相同，而完全的化学计量还原仅在较高温度下是可能的。在乙烷脱氢实验中使用的催化剂应该仅通过标准预处理部分还原。样品B的氧化还原循环也在DSC中重现，而吸热转变的热量总和约为58 mJ/mg。实际的还原热小于计算的还原热，因为总体还原的第二步是放热的。在DSC中的再氧化显示出更大的放热转变热，而部分过量的热量来自吸附氢气的氧化。过量的热量对于在沸石通道中以分散的无定形形式生成Ga,O是必要的。不太可能(GaO) +Z-是再氧化的最终产物。最初的几个小时的快速重量恢复与GaO+Z-的形成有关，但长期结果证实Ga&,是长期再氧化的最终产物。在微型反应器中的再氧化可能不会完全，而高活性和选择性的Ga/MFI-B可能同时包含镓晶格阳离子和额外的框架Ga,O。这种组合可能增强氢气的解吸速率，从而提高芳构化速率。氢气解吸可能在平均氧化态略低于3+的分散镓氧化物物种中是最佳的。Ga/ZSM-5催化剂含有Ga3+/Ga+形式的氧化还原对，而镓还原到Ga+的程度受到晶格中阴离子位点可用性的限制。乙烷芳构化的最佳催化剂是通过氢气还原分散镓，然后将其再氧化为分散的Ga3+相来制备的。再氧化的催化剂在所使用的反应条件下是稳定的，但在较高压力下对氢气的再还原是不稳定的。一个显著还原的催化剂(Ga+/Z- ca. 1)在芳烃形成方面活性和选择性都较低，并且由于转化为Ga+Z-位点导致的布伦斯特酸度降低，其水裂解活性也低于未还原或再氧化的材料。TGA还原研究表明，[Ga(OH),] +是离子交换Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中的交换离子，这些离子也可以被氢气还原为Ga+。这种类型的还原催化剂在催化和氧化还原行为上与从ZSM-5和jI-Ga203的机械混合物制备的还原催化剂相似。

1.镓的状态和镓/ZSM-5催化剂的预处理对芳构化活性有显著影响。ZSM-5中交换的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。还原的催化剂表现出类似的氧化还原行为，对于丙烷芳构化，其活性与Ga203和H-ZSM-5物理混合物制备的催化剂相当。然而，对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过充分再氧化的材料活性高或选择性好。在550C下再氧化生成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这在从乙烷生产芳烃方面是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢反应条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。这些材料中框架外镓的主要作用是增强烯烃、二烯烃或环烯烃的脱氢速率。高表面积的Ga2O3和蒸煮的镓硅酸盐在500-600C的温度范围内可以显著速率芳构化脂肪族二烯烃、1-己烯和环己烯。镓在沸石通道内的分散和氧化态对烷烃脱氢和水裂解的相对速率有很大影响。芳烃/甲烷选择性比是这些相对速率的良好指标。对乙烷脱氢催化剂性能的各种预处理效果进行了测试。为了获得高产率的芳烃，通常在催化剂中添加少量的铼、铂或铑。Ga2O3的还原对于在沸石内分散镓是必要的，但最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂用于生产芳烃并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。
