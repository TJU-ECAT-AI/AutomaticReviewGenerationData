          [1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

          The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

          镓的状态和镓/ZSM-5催化剂的预处理对芳构化活性有显著影响。ZSM-5中交换的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。还原的催化剂表现出类似的氧化还原行为，对于丙烷芳构化，其活性与Ga203和H-ZSM-5物理混合物制备的催化剂相当。然而，对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过充分再氧化的材料活性高或选择性好。在550C下再氧化生成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这在从乙烷生产芳烃方面是最佳的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢反应条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。这些材料中框架外镓的主要作用是增强烯烃、二烯烃或环烯烃的脱氢速率。高表面积的Ga2O3和蒸煮的镓硅酸盐在500-600C的温度范围内可以显著速率芳构化脂肪族二烯烃、1-己烯和环己烯。镓在沸石通道内的分散和氧化态对烷烃脱氢和水裂解的相对速率有很大影响。芳烃/甲烷选择性比是这些相对速率的良好指标。对乙烷脱氢催化剂性能的各种预处理效果进行了测试。为了获得高产率的芳烃，通常在催化剂中添加少量的铼、铂或铑。Ga2O3的还原对于在沸石内分散镓是必要的，但最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂用于生产芳烃并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。
