[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
[2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
[3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
[4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
[5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
[6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
[7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
[8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
[9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
[10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
[11] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

1.The state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts are influenced by pretreatments. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. An ion-exchanged, reduced catalyst has similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation occurs rapidly at 550C, but does not regenerate Ga203, instead forming a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for ethane aromatization. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen. The conclusion is based on observations that hydrogen pretreatment greatly improves selectivities and activities for aromatics production from propane, gallium does not insert into the zeolitic framework upon reduction, and hydrogen reduction of Ga203/H-ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga(NO3)/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials correlates with gallium reduction stoichiometry. The aim of the work is to demonstrate that gallium-exchanged materials fit into the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and that the most active and selective catalyst for aromatics production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

1.镓/ZSM-5催化剂的镓状态和芳构化活性受预处理的影响。ZSM-5离子交换中的镓可以还原为Ga+，这受到晶格中阴离子位点数量的限制。离子交换和还原的催化剂具有相似的氧化还原行为，其丙烷芳构化的活性与Ga203和H-ZSM-5物理混合物制备的催化剂相当。然而，对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃，还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂不如经过充分再氧化的材料活性和选择性高。再氧化在550C下迅速发生，但不会再生Ga203，而是形成更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这对乙烷芳构化是最优的。这种形式的Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢条件下是稳定的，但可以被氢还原。结论基于以下观察：氢预处理极大地提高了从丙烷生产芳烃的选择性和活性，还原时镓不会插入到沸石框架中，Ga203/H-ZSM-5机械混合物和Ga(NO3)/H-ZSM-5浸渍材料的氢还原与镓还原的化学计量相关。工作的目的是证明镓交换材料符合镓还原的化学计量理论，并且最活跃和选择性最高的芳烃生产催化剂并不包含还原的Ga+作为框架阳离子。
