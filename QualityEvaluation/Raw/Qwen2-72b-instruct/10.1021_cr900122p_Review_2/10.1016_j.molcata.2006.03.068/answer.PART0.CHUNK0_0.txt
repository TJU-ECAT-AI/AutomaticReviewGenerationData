The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational lifetimes, further enhancing their industrial application.
