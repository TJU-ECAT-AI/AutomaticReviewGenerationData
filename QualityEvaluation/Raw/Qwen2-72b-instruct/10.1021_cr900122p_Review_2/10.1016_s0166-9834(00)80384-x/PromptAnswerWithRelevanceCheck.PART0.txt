1.The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted in the absence of co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

1.轻烷烃转化为更有用的产品受到了广泛关注，特别是甲烷催化转化为甲醇或更高碳氢化合物。像C&/C这样的高烷烃可以在没有共反应物的情况下进行转化。丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢生成烯烃是Oleflex、Cyclar和MB-forming等过程的核心，这些过程使用ZSM-5等催化剂将轻气体转化为芳烃，特别是BTX。轻烷烃转化为芳烃并不完全选择性，还会形成轻烯烃。在Zn-ZSM-5上，部分在芳构化过程中失去的氢以二氢的形式释放，从而提高了BTX的选择性。Ga-ZSM-5或GaZn-ZSM-5催化剂以类似的方式运行，但由于锌在反应温度下挥发，因此更倾向于使用含镓样品。

1.The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has been a focus of research, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming have been developed for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes, and for aromatization of light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts improve BTX selectivity by releasing part of the hydrogen atom pool as dihydrogen. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples being preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.
