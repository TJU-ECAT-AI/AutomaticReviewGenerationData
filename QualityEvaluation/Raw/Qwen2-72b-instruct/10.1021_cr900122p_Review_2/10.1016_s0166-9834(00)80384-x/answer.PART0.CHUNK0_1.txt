1.The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has been a focus of research, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming have been developed for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes, and for aromatization of light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts improve BTX selectivity by releasing part of the hydrogen atom pool as dihydrogen. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples being preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

1.将轻烷烃转化为更有用的产品一直是研究的焦点，特别是将甲烷催化转化为甲醇或更高碳氢化合物。像C&/C这样的高烷烃可以在没有共反应物的情况下进行转化。已经开发了像Oleflex、Cyclar和MB-forming这样的过程，用于丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢到烯烃，以及用于将轻气体芳构化为芳烃，特别是BTX，使用像ZSM-5这样的催化剂。将轻烷烃转化为芳烃的转化不是完全选择性的，也会形成轻烯烃。Zn-ZSM-5催化剂通过将部分氢原子池释放为二氢来提高BTX选择性。Ga-ZSM-5或GaZn-ZSM-5催化剂以类似的方式运行，由于在反应温度下锌的挥发，含有镓的样品更受欢迎。
