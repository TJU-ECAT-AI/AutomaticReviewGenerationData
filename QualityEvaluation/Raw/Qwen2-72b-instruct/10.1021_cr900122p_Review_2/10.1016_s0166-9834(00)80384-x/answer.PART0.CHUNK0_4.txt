1.The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, especially the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. The conversion of higher alkanes can proceed without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, particularly BTX, using catalysts such as ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

1.轻烷烃转化为更有用的产品受到了广泛关注，特别是甲烷催化转化为甲醇或更高碳氢化合物。较高烷烃的转化可以不使用共反应物。丙烷和丁烷的催化脱氢生成烯烃是Oleflex、Cyclar和MB-forming等过程的核心，这些过程使用ZSM-5等催化剂将轻气体转化为芳烃，特别是BTX。轻烷烃转化为芳烃并不完全选择性，还会形成轻烯烃。在Zn-ZSM-5上，部分在芳构化过程中失去的氢以氢气形式释放，提高了BTX的选择性。Ga-ZSM-5或GaZn-ZSM-5催化剂以类似方式运行，但由于锌在反应温度下挥发，因此更倾向于使用含镓样品。
