Understanding Methane Aromatization on a Zn-Modified High-Silica Zeolite Graphical Abstract It takes two: A high level of conversion of 13C atoms of methane into the products of methane/propane coaromatization on zeolite Zn/H-BEA has been demonstrated by 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopic analysis and GC-MS. The isotope-labeling experiments show the mechanism consists of the methylation of aromatic compounds formed from the propane followed by ring-expansion/contraction (see scheme).
Methane is the principle constituent of natural gas and also the most inert of the saturated hydrocarbons. Its conversion into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels represents one of the most important challenges in modern catalysis.1 Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane. It has been reported recently that the conversion of methane during coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes (C2C6) at 670870K in the presence of bifunctional catalysts (mainly, high-silica ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 zeolites, modified with gallium or zinc) may reach 2040%.24 However, previous experiments in which 13C-labeled methane was used did not confirm the presence of the 13C-labeled atoms from the methane in the aromatization products.5 This result gave rise to scepticism as to whether methane-involved aromatization occurred at all.5 Herein we report that transfer of isotopically 13C-labeled atoms from methane into the aromatic products does occur to a high degree during the co-conversion of methane and propane on the Zn-modified high-silica zeolite BEA. We have identified the nature of the intermediates formed during the activation of methane and established how the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds occurs.
Figure1 shows the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra6 of the products (in their adsorbed state on the zeolite catalyst) which are formed from methane and propane at 823873K. The spectrum of the products formed from unlabeled CH4 and C3H8 exhibits only a weak signal at δ=8.5ppm from methane (Figure1a). When unlabeled CH4 was replaced with 13CH4, the spectrum of the reaction products showed two new signals, which undoubtedly belong to hydrocarbons containing the 13C labels from the 13CH4 (Figure1b). The carbon atoms of the 13C-labeled methane molecules are incorporated into both methyl groups (signal at δ=20ppm) and aromatic rings (δ=130ppm) of the methyl-substituted aromatic compounds7 (Figure1b,c).

Asterisks (*) in Figures1, 3, and 4 denote the spinning side bands.
According to GC-MS analysis of the products extracted from the zeolite, a mixture of benzene and toluene, as well as m- and p-xylenes (BTX) with 13C enrichment is formed from 13CH4 and unlabeled propane at 773823K (Figure2). The presence of singly (13C1), doubly (13C2), and triply (13C3) labeled molecules of BTX (Figure2b) provides proof for the incorporation of 13C-labeled methane into both the methyl groups and the carbon atoms of the aromatic rings of BTX.

Neat propane converts on Zn/H-BEA into a mixture of aromatic products and methane at lower temperature (573723K; Figure1d). According to the 1H MAS NMR spectra, approximately 1.61.7 methane molecules are produced per reacted propane molecule. The possible overall reaction which describe the aromatization of propane can be described by Equation(1).
(1) The embedding of the carbon atoms of 13CH4 into the aromatic compounds is observed for samples heated at 823873K (Figure1b,c) and for those which were preheated at lower temperatures of 573723K. In the latter case, the complete conversion of propane into aromatic compounds occurs (Figure1d) prior to the transfer of the 13C atom from methane into the aromatic molecules, which begins at 823K. Thus, a possible pathway for the conversion of methane may represent the interaction of CH4 with the aromatic molecules formed exclusively from propane [Eq.(2)].
(2) Both unlabeled methane formed in reaction(1) and 13CH4 introduced as the co-reactant can participate in the alkylation reaction. Taking into account both the stoichiometry of reaction(1) and the methane/propane ratio in the initial reactant mixture (1:1), the expected 12CH4/13CH4 alkylating mixture should contain about 38mol% 13CH4. This value is highly consistent with the amount of 13C label in aromatic compounds formed from 13CH4 and C3H8 if converted into singly 13C-labeled molecules (2551% for 15min reaction at 823K, see Figure2b). This fact, as well as the finding that the mole fraction of the singly 13C-labeled molecules of toluene and xylene appreciably exceeds that of benzene (Figure2b), provides additional evidence that the transfer of the 13C atoms from methane into the BTX molecules starts with the methanation of aromatic compounds formed from propane [Eq.(2)].
The conversion of neat methane as well as the co-conversion of methane and benzene has been further studied to gain insight into the mechanisms of both the activation and conversion of methane into aromatic compounds. The activation of methane on Zn-containing zeolites was earlier presumed2,4 to proceed with the formation of a methyl cation by transfer of a hydride ion from the methane molecule, which was preactivated on the metal oxide species, to the carbenium ion formed from higher hydrocarbons. Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9). We have not detected any surface methyl species during the reaction of methane on the unpromoted acidic form of the zeolite. Thus, both the methoxy and zinc-methyl species may be formed by heterolytic dissociative adsorption of methane on nanosized ZnO clusters located inside the channels of the Zn/H-BEA zeolite9 (Scheme1a). The dissociation of methane on ZnO species may be facilitated by neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite.2b Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint 13CNMR spectra of 13CH4 heated on zeolite Zn/H-BEA: a)at 523K (13C CP/MAS spectrum); b)at 623K (13C CP/MAS spectrum); c)at 823K (13C MAS spectrum).

In the absence of a co-reactant, the methoxy group is further partially oxidized at 523K into the surface formate Zn-O-CHO (δ=173ppm10). The latter species interacts with Zn-CH3 to produce acetaldehyde (δ=31ppm for CH3 and δ=226ppm for the carbonyl group,7 Figure3a). At higher reaction temperatures, acetic acid (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH11) is formed as the result of the further oxidation of acetaldehyde (Figure3b). Finally, at 823K, which is used for the co-conversion of propane and methane, the only 13C-labeled product observed is carbon dioxide (δ=127ppm, Figure3c) which is formed by decarboxylation of acetic acid.12 Aromatic compounds were not detected in either the 13C or 1H MAS NMR spectra in the conversion of neat methane under these conditions.
In contrast to neat methane, the methoxy species (δ=58ppm, Figure4a) represents the only intermediate formed at 523K from 13CH4 in the presence of benzene. At 573K, the surface methoxy species converts quantitatively into the methyl group of methylbenzenes (δ=20ppm, Figure4b). At 823K, both a broadening of the signal at δ=130ppm and a decrease in the intensity of the signal corresponding to the methyl groups occur, which points to a transfer of the 13C-label from the methyl groups to the aromatic ring of the methylbenzenes, which exhibit a variety of chemical shifts (from δ=125 to 135ppm,7 Figure4c). Both the methylation stage at 573K and further transfer of the 13C-label into the aromatic rings of the methylbenzenes at 823K are also evident in the mass spectra (not shown).

Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4. A methoxy species is the intermediate of this reaction (Scheme1a). The methoxy species, as a stabilized methyl cation, does not convert directly into aromatic compounds in the absence of a higher hydrocarbon as a co-reactant. Therefore, the earlier presumed mechanism2 of the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds via the formation of a CH2 radical from the methyl cation, its dimerization to ethene, oligomerization, and dehydrocyclization should be rejected. This mechanism could not be responsible for the 13C enrichment observed in the aromatic rings of BTX in the present study.
The embedding of the 13C atoms from methane into the aromatic ring is a result of a secondary process of intramolecular scrambling of the 13C label in methylbenzenes by a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism.13 The reversible reaction(2) also provides a notable enrichment of benzene molecules with the 13C isotope. Our proposed scheme of 13C-label scrambling involves the formation of a phenylmethyl cation as the intermediate or transition state (Scheme1b) instead of protonated methylbenzenes.13 This assumption is quite reasonable since a small fraction of diphenylmethane is formed from 13CH4 and benzene at 573K (Figure4b, δ=41ppm for the CH2 group14) as a result of the alkylation of benzene with the phenylmethyl cation.15 Since the surface methoxy species is even formed from neat methane on Zn/H-BEA, a higher hydrocarbon as a supposed source of carbenium ions2 is not a requirement for the activation of methane. The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a).
In summary, by using isotope-tracing experiments with 13C-labeled methane we have demonstrated a high level of involvement of methane in the aromatization of higher alkanes on Zn-modified zeolites. The mechanism of the aromatization has been established and consists of the alkylation of aromatic compounds, which form exclusively from the higher alkanes. The methoxy species formed by dissociative adsorption of methane on ZnO species is responsible for the alkylation. Further embedding of the 13C-labeled atoms from the methyl groups of methyl-substituted benzene derivatives into their aromatic rings occurs through a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism.
Experimental Section Methane aromatization was performed in a glass, closed batch microreactor (0.2cm3; sealed glass insert for 7mm zirconia NMR rotors) with coadsorbed 13CH4 and propane (1:1) at 573873K. The Zn/H-BEA zeolite (Si/Al=18, 7.2wt% Zn) sample (ca.80mg) was activated at 673K for 20h under a vacuum, with the residual pressure less than 102Pa. Detailed characteristics of the zeolite used are provided in Ref.9. 300μmolg1 of each alkane was coadsorbed on the zeolite sample under vacuum and then the reactor sealed. After reaction at 573873K, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature for insitu NMR analysis. 13CNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer under magic spinning and with cross-polarization (CP/MAS). Identical conditions (CP parameters, rotation speeds, and number of scans) were used to enable comparison of the spectra in each series of experiments. The products were further extracted from the zeolite sample with diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and Varian Saturn-2000 mass spectrometer.
