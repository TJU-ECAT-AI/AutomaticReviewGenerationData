izares, L. Rodriguez Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Chemistry University of Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real 13004, Spain Received 27 November 1997; received in revised form 27 March 1998; accepted 27 March 1998 Abstract The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, UV diffuse reectance spectroscopy, BET, TPR and TPD of ammonia. Three different types of supported species were detected:tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies signicantly with the tungsten loading. At high contents, a decrease in BET areas due to the partial blocking up of the channels of the zeolite and a lessening of the number of acid sites were observed. It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. HCOH selectivity seems to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst. # 1998 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]. Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process. These have included high- pressure studies without catalysts [47] and atmo- spheric pressure studies with heterogeneous catalysts.Both processes have been investigated in a wide range of experimental conditions although, unfortunately,progress towards obtaining a industrially viable pro- cess has been very slow.Several supported oxide catalysts have been employed for the partial oxidation at atmospheric pressure, among which silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts have been reported to be the most active and selective for oxygenate production. Earlier studies of partial oxidation of methane over silica supported MoO3 were performed using nitrous oxide as oxidant [810], leading to yields of formaldehyde higher than 2.5%. However, N2O is too expensive to be used industrially for this purpose. Thus, the latter studies have been focused on the use of molecular oxygen as oxidant.Applied Catalysis A: General 172 (1998) 165176 *Corresponding author.

0.5% to 1.2%. Moreover, the formaldehyde selectivity
increased with the molar ratio methane/oxygen. Spen- cer [11] and Spencer and Pereira [12] performed the oxidation of methane over MoO3 and V2O5 supported catalysts obtaining selectivities in excess of 70% at very low conversion, although the selectivity dropped drastically with increasing conversion. More recent work by Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst.
It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior. Banares et al.
[13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species. Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demon- strated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the for- mation of complete oxidation products.
In a recent study [15], in which silica supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts were compared, it was seen that methane conversion appeared to be related to disperse isolated surface metal oxide species, with the surface vanadium oxide species being more reac- tive than molybdenum oxide species. However, silica supported vanadium catalysts showed lower yields to HCOH than silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts.
In addition to silica, zeolites have been used as support. Ban ares et al. [17] showed that the rate of methane conversion with molecular oxygen was found to be dependent on the MoO3 dispersion on the US-Y zeolite surface, whereas the selectivity towards for- maldehyde seemed to depend on the structure of the molybdenum phase. On the other hand, several authors have recently reported the transformation of methane to higher hydrocarbons and aromatics products using Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts without adding oxidants [1820]. Methane oligomerization reaction is proposed to be catalyzed by molybdenum species located inside the zeolite channels together with the Bro nsted acid sites of HZSM-5. The use of the HZSM-5 zeolite as a support of the metal oxide phase is very interesting due to three reasons: its thermal stability, the high surface area that enables high metal oxide loading and the presence of acid sites that could lead to the formation of certain active metal oxide species.
On the basis of the chemical similarities between MoO3 and WO3 it seems reasonable to expect a parallelism in their catalytic properties. Specically, Salvati et al. [21] showed that WO3/Al2O3 catalysts were structurally similar to MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts and that the WO4 2 interaction species closely resembled the molybdenumalumina surface complex.
In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant. Likewise, the catalysts were characterized in order to understand the interaction of metal oxide phase with the support and establish the relationship between both catalytic activity and formaldehyde selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization using ethanol as template, according to the earlier reported procedure [22]. The product was 100% crystalline (determined by X-ray powder dif- fraction (XRD) method) with SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 90. The acid form of the zeolite was obtained by ion exchange with an aqueous solution of HCl (0.6 N) and then dried at 1108C for 14 h. The W/HZSM-5 cata- lysts were prepared by aqueous impregnation of the zeolite powder with different amounts of ammonium meta-tungstate, (NH4)6H2W12O40xH2O, to give tung- sten loading in the range 0.311.9 wt%. After 4 h of stirring, the water was removed by evaporation under vaccum. Next, the impregnated catalysts were cal- cined in air at 6758C for 2.5 h. The catalysts will be named to as ZWx where x indicates the weight per- centage of tungsten in the catalysts. The NaZW7.1 catalysts with 7.1 wt% tungsten loading was obtained in a way similar to the other catalysts, from the sodium form of the ZSM-5 zeolite. 166

2.2. Catalytic runs
The experiments were carried out in a xed bed at atmospheric pressure. The apparatus consisted of gas feed systems for each component (methane and oxy- gen), with individual control by mass owmeters, a xed bed quartz reactor and an exit gas owmeter.
Three heating zones were surrounding the reactor. The temperature of each zone was independently con- trolled within 18C by temperature controllers. The temperature of the catalytic bed was measured by a thermocouple placed in the center of this one. With this reactor design a variation of only 58C was observed along the catalytic bed. The dimensions of the reaction zone of the reactor were i.d. 21.4 mm and length 6 cm. Analyses of the feed and reactor efuent streams were performed by gas chromatography using thermal conductivity detectors. A Porapak Q column was used to separate CH4, CO2, COO2, HCOH and water, and a molecular sieve (5 A ) packed column to separate CO and O2. Calibration for formaldehyde was obtained with a 40% HCOH aqueous solution.
The catalyst was pretreated in the reactor under an oxygen ow from the ambient temperature to the reaction temperature, 6508C and held at the latter for approximately 1 h. Space velocity of the feed was 7.41 g h /mol and the CH4 : O2 molar ratio was
5.3 : 1. It was proven that approximately 2 h were
required to reach apparently steady conditions. Sam- pling of the product stream was repeated until the analytical results were reproducible. In the present research, the carbon balance was always better than 96%.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area and micropore volumes of the calcined samples were measured by using a Quanta- chrome Autosorb-1 apparatus with nitrogen as the adsorbate. XRD patterns were recorded on a Philips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. UV diffuse reectance spectra (UV DRS) were performed by using Spectralon as reference on a Perkin Elmer Lambda-20 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reectance accessory. The spectra were recorded immediately after calcination of the samples. The scanning wavelength range was 198-500 nm and the scan speed was 120 nm min. TPR experiments were recorded on a Micromertics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples were pretreated from ambient temperature to 6758C in argon ow. Following pretreatment, TPR experiments were run in a 17% H2/Ar stream (50 Ncm3/min) heating up to 9008C at a rate of 108C/min. During this time the exit gas was monitored using a TCD detector. Total acid site density of the catalysts was measured by a temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA) by means of a Micro- meritics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples were housed in a quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in owing helium while heating at 158C/min to 6758C. After a period of 30 min at 6758C, the samples were cooled at 1808C and saturated by owing a pure ammonia stream for 15 min. The catalyst was then allowed to equilibrate under helium ow at 1808C for 1 h.
Finally, the ammonia was desorbed by using a linear heating rate of 158C/min up to 6758C. Temperature and detector signals were simultaneously recorded.
The unique area under the curve was integrated to determine the total acidity of the catalyst. The uptake of ammonia is used to represent the number of strong acid sites on the catalyst.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the supported tungsten
species BET surface areas and micropore volumes of all W/HZSM-5 catalysts with various tungsten loading are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that both para- meters decreased with increasing amounts of tungsten.
From this result we can see that the tungsten species easily enter or partially block the channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite and thus reduce the surface areas and the micropore volumes of the catalysts.
The effect of tungsten loading on the acidity of the catalysts was also studied by TPD of ammonia.
Results in Table 2 show that with the introduction of tungsten into the HZSM-5 zeolite the number of acid sites decreased, and the extent of the elimination of strong acid sites increased with an increase in tungsten loading. On the other hand, it can also be observed in Table 2 that the maximum ammonia desorption temperature increased with decreasing tungsten loading. This apparent increasing in desorp-

167 tion temperature could be due to ammonia re-adsorp- tion phenomena caused when the number of acid sites is increased. Therefore, from TPD results in can be concluded that the number of the acid sites decrease when tungsten loading in the HZSM-5 zeolite is increased. Likewise, it can be shown up that the total acidity of NaZW9 sample is negligible.
The UV diffuse reectance spectra of the W/ HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten oxide load- ing are shown in Fig. 1. Two major bands at 220 nm and at 310 nm can be observed for all the samples.Likewise, a further band at about 375 n (represented as a shoulder) is noted in the catalysts with W loading higher than 2.4%. The assignment of these three bands can be done by analyzing the spectra of tungsten compounds with a known geometry. In the inset of Fig. 1 are shown the spectra of both solid sodium tungstate, exclusively constituted of tetrahedral tung- sten, and ammonium metatungstate and tungsten oxide, both mainly constituted by octahedral tungsten (tetrahedral species are also present as terminal tung- sten atoms). By comparing these with the W/HZSM-5 catalysts spectra, it can be concluded that the band at 220 nm could be assigned to the tetrahedrally coordi- nated W(VI) species while the other bands at about 310 nm and about 375 nm could be assigned to octa- hedral W(VI) species: polytungstate and WO3 crystal- lites, respectively. This fact seems to be in good agreement with the observation made by other authors for silica, alumina and titania WO3 supported catalysts [2325].
XRD patterns of W/HZSM-5 catalysts with differ- ent W loading calcined at 6758C are shown in Fig. 2.
Peaks corresponding to crystallites of WO3 begin to be visible for tungsten loading higher than 4,0%, the intensity of these peaks becoming higher with increas- Table 1 BET surface areas and micropore volumes of the W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loading Catalyst Tungsten content (wt.%) BET surface area (m2/g) Micropore volume (cm3/g)

ing WO3 loading. Spencer [11], in a work carried out over MoO3/SiO2 catalyst, observed peaks at MoO3
5.16 wt.% and above, corresponding to crystallites of
molybdenum that was 50 A or more in diameter.
This author supposed three-dimensional structures of MoO3 to start forming at much lower coverages. On the other hand, both Xu et al. [18] and Chen et al. [19] detected MO3 crystallites in Mo/HZSM-5 for Mo loading higher than 10%. According to the latter, if the molybdenum loading were below this value, most of the molybdenum species would be located in the channels of the HZSM-5 zeolite while if it were above this value, an isolated molybdenum trioxide phase and polymolybdenum oxide species would appear. In this way, highly dispersed species with terminal Mo=O sites would appear at low molybdenum loading while polymolybdenum species would be formed at high molybdenum loading on the external surface of the catalysts. In turn, Kohler et al. [25], in a study carried out over tungsten oxide supported on alumina,showed, by using Laser Raman spectroscopy, that at low tungsten contents (2 wt.%), a surface-supported,tetrahedrally coordinated species predominated over the octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species whereas at high contents (>10 wt.%) the latter pre- dominated over the former, the crystalline WO3 being only present in small amounts at higher contents. This general picture is in good agreement with UV DRS measurements. On the other hand, since UV diffuse reectance band at 375 nm is presumably related to the existence of WO3 crystallites, it can be veried from Fig. 1 that the formation of these starts at lower coverages that 7,1 wt.%.
TPR proles of the W/HZSM-5 catalysts and the bulk WO3 are given in Fig. 3. As we can see all the curves contain several peaks in the temperature range
3009008C. TPR prole of bulk WO3 exhibits two
peaks at 6558C and 7408C. For all the supported catalysts a rst peak appears at 5305908C although it is overlapped by the second peak for tungsten loading above 4.0%. This second peak with a max- imum at 6306408C appears for tungsten loading above 2.4% being the most intense for these samples.
A third peak at 6708C, represented as a shoulder, is seen for catalysts with a tungsten loading higher than
7.1%. Finally, for ZW11.9 catalyst a further well-
dened peak at 7508C is observed. The appearance of TPR peaks at higher temperatures is related to the decrease in the dispersion of the tungsten oxide spe- cies (namely, polytungstate and WO3 crystallites). In Fig. 2.

169 fact, the TPR prole of the highest loaded sample closely resembles the bulk tungsten oxide prole. The relative reducibility of the catalysts (dened as H2 consumption per mol of tungsten for the sample to H2 consumption per mol of tungsten for the bulk WO3 ratio) as a function of the W loading is shown in Fig. 4.
An increase in this parameter for the higher-loaded catalysts is observed indicating that the aggregation of the tungsten oxide species results in a signicant increase of the degree of reduction of the tungsten species. This fact implies that the dispersed tungsten oxide species are less reducible probably due to the oxide-support interaction is stronger than that of the bulk tungsten oxide. These results conrm those obtained with XRD and UV DRS studies. Similar ndings have been reported by Faraldos et al. for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [15].
Fig. 5 shows the UV diffuse reectance spectrum of the NaZW9 catalyst compared with that correspond- ing to ZW9 catalyst spectrum. It can be seen that both spectra are different indicating that the presence of the acid sites of the zeolite is closely related to the nature of the tungsten oxide species.
3.2. Methane oxidation
The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen over W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O. Fig. 6 shows methane conversion, HCOH selectivity and spacetime yield (STY) of formaldehyde for all the catalysts. Table 3 shows the methane conversion and product selectivities for the W/HZSM-5 catalysts,together with the results obtained in the uncatalytic Fig. 4. Influence of tungsten loading in the reducibility of the W/HZSM-5 catalysts.

reaction using a CSi bed (blank experiment), and those with NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5.
In Table 3 it can be observed that the contribution of the homogenious reaction is not negligible in the experimental conditions used in this work, since a methane conversion equal to 1.8% to oxides of carbon is obtained with the blank experiment. This fact points out the relevance of gas-phase reaction in initiating methane conversion at high temperature [26]. Like- wise, HZSM-5 zeolite shows a great activity in the oxidation of methane leading to the formation of total oxidation products, mainly carbon monoxide. By contrast, NaZSM-5 zeolite shows much lower activity and CO selectivity. According to the literature [18,19],this fact implies that the acid centers of the HZSM-5 are active sites for methane activation.
As may be seen from Fig. 6, for the W/HZSM-5 catalysts, methane conversion increases with increas- ing tungsten loading although this increase is very low for 2.411.9% W loading. Formaldehyde selectivity increases for catalysts from 0.3% to 2.4% tungsten content, whereas it decreases slightly up to 11.9 wt.%.
As a result, the spacetime yield of formaldehyde passes through a maximum at about 7.1 wt.% of tungsten loading.
From Table 3 it can be observed that for tungsten content higher than 0.8% carbon monoxide selectivity increased and, as a consequence, carbon dioxide selectivity decreases with increasing tungsten loading.The anomalous result for ZW0.3 catalyst (in terms of CO and CO2 selectivities) can be explained on the basis that at very low tungsten loading, important parts of the zeolite pores are not blocked by the tungsten species. Therefore, methane activation can occur both on active sites of the HZSM-5 (leading to CO forma- tion) and on the supported oxide phase. In this table,the result obtained with the NaZW7.1 catalyst is also included. Both methane conversion and HCOH selec- tivity are much lower than those obtained with the corresponding ZW7.1 catalyst.
4. Discussion
4.1. Nature of the supported species
According to the results reported for silica, alumina and titania WO3 supported catalysts, three types of tungsten species may be formed: isolated tetrahedra

171 meric species such as polytungstates with W(VI) in octahedral coordination and WO3 crystallites [21,23 25,27].
The UV diffuse reectance spectra (Fig. 1) show that these three species are formed in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst, although the relative amount of each one varies signicantly with the tungsten loading. So, for tungsten loading lower than 4.0%, monomeric species are predominant though polymeric species and WO3 crystallites (W loading higher than 2.4%) are present to a minor extent. Due to their large size (the size of polytungstate species is about 2 nm, higher than the size of the HZSM-5 pores), these latter species are mainly formed on the external surface of the zeolite and highly dispersed at lower tungsten loading. Like- wise, the observed decrease in the BET area (Table 1) suggests that some of the polymeric species could be located in the entrance of the channels of the HZSM-5 zeolite blocking them up. When the tungsten loading is above 4.0%, an increase in the amount of polymeric species is observed. Thereby, the external surface of the zeolite is gradually covered leading to the blocking of the HZSM-5 channels to a large extent. This fact can be conrmed by a drastic decrease in BETarea for tungsten loading above 7.1 wt.%. Similar observation has been reported for Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [18,19].
Likewise, an increase in tungsten loading produces an increase in the degree of aggregation of the polymeric species, so that the size of WO3 crystallites is big enough to be detected by means of XRD (Fig. 2).
The decrease in the dispersion of the tungsten oxide species due to the formation of the polytungstate species can be qualitatively seen by plotting the UV absorbances at 220 and 310 nm ratio (A220/A310) as a function of the tungsten concentration (Fig. 7). For low tungsten loadings (0.32.4%) this ratio increases slightly with a maximum for ZW2.4 catalyst indicat- ing that the formation of monomeric tetrahedral spe- cies is higher than that of polytungstate ones. For higher tungsten loading the ratio A220/A310 decreases markedly due to an increase in the degree of poly- merization leading to a lesser-dispersed tungsten oxide phase. This interpretation is consistent with the TPR results and with the formation of WO3 crystallites observed for W loading higher than 4.0%.
On the other hand, owing to the small size of the tetrahedral species (<2 A ), it is very likely these ones to be mainly formed by grafting of the tungsten oxide species with the Bro nsted acid sites located inside the pores of the HZSM-5. This phenomena would be analogous to the grafting of the WO2 4 ions with OH groups of silica and alumina [21,27,28]. Mulcahy et al. [29], showed that Mo7O6 24 and W12O6 39 ions produce loosely and tightly bound surface species on Fig. 7. Influence of tungsten loading on absorbances at 220 and 310 nm ratio. 172
A. de Lucas et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 172 (1998) 165176
alumina. Both loosely and tightly bound species would appear by electrostatic adsorption and conden- sation, respectively, on surface hydroxyls. If a similar mechanism of supporting is supposed, the polytung- state species, due to their size, would be preferentially located on the external surface of zeolite. The results of total acidity measured by ammonia TPD seem to support these conclusions. At low tungsten loading (0.30.8%) the decrease in the number of acid sites will mainly be due to the grafting of tungsten species with the Bro nsted acid sites. When tungsten loading increases, a decrease in the acidity probably due to the deposition of the tungsten species over the acid sites together with the blocking of the channels is observed.
This latter effect would be the most important at the highest loading. Again, these observations are in agreement with the observed for Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [18,19].
The analysis of the UV diffuse reectance spectra of the NaZW7.1 catalyst (Fig. 5) seems to be contra- dictory. This catalyst has no acid site since it has not been ion exchanged. Therefore, the formation of the tetrahedral monomeric species is not expected. How- ever, the most intense band in the spectra is at about 220 nm corresponding to this type of species; the band around 310 nm corresponding to octahedral the poly- meric species being practically a shoulder of the former band. According to the observations reported for alkali-doped V2O5 and MoO3 silica supported catalysts [16,30], the major part of the tetrahedral species may be attributed to the formation of surface sodium tungstate species. The remaining tungstate would be minor amounts of tetrahedral monomers grafted to the zeolite and octahedral polymeric species.
4.2. The changes in the supported species during
preparation stage It is well known that in aqueous solution the struc- ture of the tungstate ion is pH-dependent [21,29].
According to the equilibrium

tungsten exists exclusively as the tetrahedral ion in neutral and alkaline solution. In acidic solution the predominant species is the octahedral W12O12 42 . These species are predominant in the ammonium metatung- state solution used in the impregnation step, since a pH value of 3.9 was found. During the impregnation stage, these species, due to their large size, would be mainly adsorbed on the positive sites of the external surface of HZSM-5 zeolite as a result of the charge interaction [9]. In fact, in the UV diffuse reectance spectrum of the uncalcined catalysts (Fig. 8) a band at about 265300 nm corresponding to these species can be observed. The observed shift of this band to lower wavelengths is attributed to the (in order to avoid changes in supported species) spectrum of uncalcined catalyst which was not registered in dehydrated con- ditions. However, simultaneously to this band, the spectrum shows a band at 220 nm corresponding to monomeric species. This fact indicates that during the impregnation stage, some tungsten species enter the channels of the zeolite and interact with the Bro nsted acid centers forming tetrahedral WO2 4 species. This aspect is quite different from that observed for WO3/ Al2O3 catalyst, in which these species are only formed during the calcination stage [21].
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the amount of the different tungsten species changes signicantly during Fig. 8. UV diffuse reflectance spectra of (a) uncalcined (sample after tungsten impregnation, not further dried or calcined) and (b) calcined ZW7.1 catalyst.

173 the calcination. The amount of the polytungstate species decreases whereas tetrahedral species slightly increases and the WO3 crystallites appear. This fact involves that some of the polymeric species formed in the impregnation stage may partially decompose upon calcination into tungstate trioxide. Furthermore, redis- persion of polymeric species over the zeolite surface may occur in some extent. These results would be in good agreement with the reported for HZSM-5 and HY supported MoO3 catalysts [1719].
4.3. Catalytic activity
The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated [13,15,3134]. However, the participation of lattice or surface activated gas-phase oxygen in the formalde- hyde formation is not clear. It seems that the oxygen activation over the catalyst surface plays a fundamen- tal role in the catalytic reation. The interaction of oxygen with the catalyst activates oxygen making it more reactive thus promoting methane activation [15,3234]. Likewise, methane can be converted into radicals by reaction with oxygen in the gas phase or in presence of catalyst thus initiating the reaction [26,31]. An analogous mechanisms may be assumed for the oxygen activation in the partial oxidation of methane over W/HZSM-5 catalysts.
On the other hand, it has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Bro nsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation [18,19]. This fact explains the difference between the results obtained in this work for the NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5 zeolites. Moreover, the active sites of the HZSM-5 lead to CO selectively and no formaldehyde formation is observed. So, it is clear that the active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase.
Thus, for the lowest tungsten loaded catalysts (ZW0.3) the HCOH yield is noticeable. The decrease in methane conversion with respect to the HZSM-5 support obtained for the low loaded catalysts (up to
2.4%) could be due to the partial blocking of the active
centers of the zeolite. For higher tungsten loading methane conversion increases indicating that the sur- face tungsten oxide phase generates own active sites able to activate gas-phase oxygen. In Fig. 9 are pre- sented methane and formaldehyde turnover frequency (TOF) values (mol CH4 converted or mol HCOH formed/mol W s) as a function of the tungsten loading.
The TOF values have been calculated under the assumption that all the supported metal is active.
Supporting the above hypothesis it can be seen that Fig. 9. Methane (-&-) and formaldehyde (-*-) turnover frequencies (TOF) for W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loading.

methane TOF decreases sharply up to 2.4% tungsten loading and slightly for higher loading. These obser- vations are in agreement with the reported by Miceli et al. for V2O5/SiO2 [35]. Formaldehyde TOF also decreases sharply up to 2.4%, this decrease then being very low. This trend can be attributed to the increase in the amount of polymeric tungsten oxide species in the catalyst with increasing tungsten loading. It causes both an increase in the aggregation of polymeric tungsten species, lessening the number of exposed tungsten sites, and a decrease in the dispersion.
Ban ares et al. [14] reported that the presence of highly dispersed polymolybdate structures on silica surface is closely related to formaldehyde selectivity. Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] has related formaldehyde selectivity with the presence of V=O bonds of tetrahedral mono- meric species of vanadium directly bonded to the support.
In this work the observed HCOH selectivity (Fig. 7) shows a trend with increasing tungsten loading very similar to that of the UV adsorbances at 220 and 310 nm ratio (Fig. 8). This fact implies that the for- maldehyde selectivity depends on the dispersion of tungsten species. Thus, for tungsten loading up to
2.4% the progressive formation of dispersed both
tetrahedral monomeric and polytungstate species leads to an increase in HCOH selectivity. Moreover,these latter species possess terminal W=O sites that could be the active centers for formaldehyde produc- tion. For higher loadings, the dispersion decreases mainly due to the growth of the polymeric WO3 species. As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity decreased slightly for tungsten loading from 2.4 to
11.9. The low value of HCOH selectivity obtained
with NaZW7.1 catalyst would be due (according to the literature ndings for alkali-doped supported MoO3 and V2O5 silia catalysts [16,30]) to the decrease in the dispersion of the supported oxide phase produced by surface sodium tungstate species.
Finally, from the results reported in this work, the mechanisms of formation of the total oxidation products does not seem to be clear. The presence of WOW bonds of polytungstate and bulk WO3 could lead to carbon oxides formation from both methane and formaldehyde in a manner similar to that of V2O5/ SiO2 and MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [13,16]. However,other factors such as further oxidation of formalde- hyde in gas phase cannot be discarded.
5. Conclusions
Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahe- dral W2 4 species probably grafted to the Bro nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites. The relative amounts of these three types of species changes sig- nicantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the poly- tungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that in the calcination step a partial redistribution of the tungsten species is produced.
The catalytic result point out that the W/HZSM-5 catalyst is active for the partial oxidation to methane to formaldehyde. HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formalde- hyde production. Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading.
