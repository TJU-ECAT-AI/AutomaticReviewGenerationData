A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH and dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 shows that only the latter are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions.
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides15 draw recently much atten- tion due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin poly- merization,12 CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyole- fins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.56 Basset et al.36 considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH.
On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zir- conium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this system. Earlier, we have performed DFT studies of the mech- anisms of H/D isotope exchange in methane7 and ethylene poly- merization8 catalysed by the YermakovBasset system. The cata- lytic activity of both types of supported zirconium hydrides was estimated to be quite proximal in respect to the polymerization of ethylene.8 Zirconium dihydrides, however, were found to be much more active in the isotope exchange reaction.7 Moreover,we calculated the activation parameters of H/D exchange for zirconium dihydrides, which are in a much better agreement with experimental data9 than those for monohydrides.
As a continuation of these studies, we consider the probable mechanisms of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on model species 1 and 2 (Schemes 1, 2) using butane as a model linear alkane. All the DFT calculations were performed under the same approach as previously7,8 using the original PRIRODA program.10 The replacement of the skeletal OSi fragments by fluorine atoms when performing quantum-chemical calculations of the structure of silica-supported compounds was proposed and substantiated earlier.11 The generalised gradient approxima- tion (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof12 was employed. The 40 core electrons of Zr, 10 for Si and 2 for C, O and F were described by effective core potentials.1315 The orbital basis sets of contracted Gaussian-type functions of size (5s1p)/[3s1p] for H, (5s5p2d)/ [3s3p2d] for C, O, F and Si, and (9s9p8d)/[5s5p4d] for Zr were used for the remaining electrons in conjunction with the den- sity-fitting basis sets of uncontracted Gaussian-type functions of size (5s1p) for H, (6s3p3d1f) for C, O, F and Si, and (10s6p6d5f5g) for Zr. Full geometry optimization of all struc- tures studied in this work was performed using analytical gradients followed by analytical calculations of the second derivatives of energy with respect to coordinates in order to characterise the nature of the resulting stationary points (mini- ma or saddle points) on the potential energy surface (PES).
Zero-point vibrational energies and thermodynamic data were calculated in the harmonic approximation.
The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides 1, which is con- sistent with that proposed by Basset et al.,36 is presented in Scheme 1. The energy profile is shown in Figure 1. The first stage of the hydrogenolysis, the transformation of the initial hydride into n-butyl derivative 4 with the elimination of a hydro- gen molecule, proceeds by the s-bond metathesis pathway via four-centered transition state 3 (E = 7.9 kcal mol1, G298
= = 28.1 kcal mol1 relative to 1 + C4H10). It was found to be endo- thermic (E = 5.3 kcal mol1, G298 = 4.0 kcal mol1). It is fol-

Scheme  1 Mendeleev Commun., 2002, 12(5), 173175 173 lowed by C2C3 bond cleavage and the migration of a β-ethyl fragment to zirconium, which leads to the formation of zirconium alkyl-ethylene complex 6 via transition state 5. The energy bar- rier for this transformation is rather high (E = 31.4 kcal mol1,
G298
= 30.9 kcal mol1) and the process is extremely ther- modynamically unfavourable (E = 20.6 kcal mol1, G298 = = 17.2 kcal mol1). The equilibrium constant for the transfor- mation 4  6 under the real experimental conditions (T = 150 C) was calculated to be 1.3×109. The coordination sphere of the metal in 6 is saturated. Thus, it cannot coordinate an extra hydro- gen molecule. Hence, the only way of its further transformations is the elimination of ethylene, as it is supposed by the Basset scheme. The corresponding transformation (6  7) leads to a further increase of the system energy (E = 5.4 kcal mol1), which is in part compensated by a considerable entropy gain (G298 = = 7.0 kcal mol1). The last stage, allowing to repeat the catalytic cycle, is the hydrogenolysis of ethyl derivative 7 by the σ-bond metathesis pathway via transition state 8 (E = 13.2 kcal mol1,
G298
= 24.7 kcal mol1 relative to 7). Effectively, the hydro- genolysis of butane using the Basset catalytic cycle describes the cleavage of butane into ethane and ethylene (C4H10 C2H6 + C2H4). The calculated H298 and G298 values for this reaction are 22.7 and 11.0 kcal mol1, respectively, which are in a good agreement with the tabulated H0 and F0 values of 22.4 and 12.5 kcal mol1, calculated from the standard forma- tion energies.16 The data suggest that the hydrogenolysis of butane cannot proceed under mild conditions on supported zirconium monohydrides 1 by the Basset mechanism. The process is un- favourable from both kinetic and thermodynamic points of view.
The thermodynamic restriction of the alkane hydrogenolysis could be overcome if the considerable energy loss for the CC bond cleavage is compensated by the formation of two ethane molecules (in case of butane) in the catalytic cycle. The overall process described by this equation (C4H10 + H2  2C2H6) is thermodynamically favourable [H298 = 11.8 kcal mol1, G298 = = 14.8 kcal mol1; H0 = 10.3 kcal mol1 (ref. 16), F0 = = 11.6 kcal mol1 (ref. 16)]. This opportunity comes true if one considers the active catalytic sites to be zirconium dihy- drides 2 (Scheme 2).
The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative 10 (E = 3.8 kcal mol1, G298 = 2.2 kcal mol1) via transition state 9 (E = 12.6 kcal mol1, G298 = 22.5 kcal mol1 relative to free reagents). The equilibrium constant of this process is
7.3×102 at 150 C. The cleavage of the C2C3 bond in the
n-butyl fragment (10  12) requires the overcoming of the top- most energy barrier on the reaction path, transition state 11 (E = 31.9 kcal mol1, G298 = 33.0 kcal mol1 relative to 10,see Figure 2). The rate constant of this process at 150 C was calculated to be 1.7×105 s1, but this stage is exothermic (E = = 8.4 kcal mol1, G298 = 8.5 kcal mol1) and thus the process may proceed under the experimental conditions described in ref. 3. It is noteworthy that the relaxation of transition state 11 leads directly to diethyl derivative 12 by-passing the stage of the intermediate η2-coordinated ethylene complex formation. Suc- cessive hydrogenolysis of 12 via standard pathway (12  13 14  15  2) requiring the overcome of two energy barriers and characterised by an overall energy gain of E = 11.1 kcal mol1, G298 = 8.5 kcal mol1. It finishes the overall thermodynami- cally favourable process and allows the catalytic cycle to restart.
Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al.,2 unlike zirconium monohydrides 1, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions. Basset et al.3 undoubt- edly proved that monohydrides 1 are mainly formed on the silica surface under conditions used for catalyst preparation.3 Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides 2 could coexist with monohydrides 1 on the silica surface. In our opinion, a more detailed experimental study has to be performed to determine the structure of real active centres in this catalytic system.
