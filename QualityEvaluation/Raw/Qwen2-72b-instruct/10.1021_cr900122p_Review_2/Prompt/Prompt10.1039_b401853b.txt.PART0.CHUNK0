E-mail: vbk@ioc.ac.ru; Fax: (7 095) 1355328; Tel: (7 095) 1357400 Received 6th February 2004, Accepted13th April 2004 Frst published as an AdvanceArticle on the web14th May 2004 Comparison of DRIFT spectra of OH groups in MFI with framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40 with the spectra of the same zeolites after reaction with zinc vapour at 773 K indicated quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2 ions. Complete substitution of protons indicates that at high Si/Al ratios some of the Zn2 cations are localized at the isolated aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges. This results in the formation of sites with only partially compensated excessive positive charges of bivalent cations. In parallel, the same amount of negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra remains without compensating cations or protons. Their negative charges are neutralized indirectly by the electrostatic interaction with the surrounding positively charged cationic sites. Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity. This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations. In the present study, this was demonstrated by very large red shifts of HH stretching vibrations of H2 adsorbed by zinc cations at 77 K and by heterolytic dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at moderately elevated temperatures. Application of low temperature H2 adsorption as a molecular probe indicated that similar sites of unusual localization of bivalent zinc cations also exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapour.
Introduction The catalytic properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent cations are quite different from those of faujasites containing the same cations. For instance, cobalt- and copper-modified MFI are active in selective reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in oxygen excess.1,2 CoMFI catalyzes the ammo-oxidation of ethane,1 whereas ZnMFI catalyzes dehy- drogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc.3,4 On the contrary, faujasites or other low-silica zeolites modified with the same cations catalyze neither of these reactions.
Our recent results also demonstrated that MFI modified with bivalent Zn or Co cations possess unusual adsorption properties. For instance, low-frequency shifts of HH stretch- ing vibrations of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by these ions at 77 K exceed 200 cm1.57,9 This is almost twice that for hydrogen adsorbed by ZnFAU.8 There is no doubt that such unusual catalytic and adsorption properties are due to the specific localization of bivalent cations in silica-rich structures.
Until recently, it has been generally believed that bivalent cations in high-silica zeolites are localized at sites containing two negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra in the next-nearest positions to each other. Several attempts have been made to predict the fraction of such sites. Feng and Hall10 and Rice et al.11 performed stochastic simulations of Al distribution in high-silica frameworks. In agreement with 29Si MAS NMR results on the random distribution of alumi- nium in MFI,12 they concluded that, at high Si/Al ratios,the probability of finding two Al ions in the same ring of the zeolite framework is very low. This conclusion is consistent with the more difficult ion exchange in MFI of sodium by mul- tivalent cations compared with faujusites. Usually the extent of exchange is at most 60%. This should be explained by the low fraction of aluminium at the sites in the next-nearest positions,while only sodium at such sites is preferentially involved in ion exchange with bivalent cations.
In this connection, an interesting alternative to ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation is modification of high-silica zeolites via a reaction of the hydrogen forms with zinc vapour at high temperatures.13,14 However, localization and properties of Zn2 ions in such samples have never yet been studied. In the present work we make use of low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe for the study of MFI with two different framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40. The results obtained on localization of zinc cations are compared with those for the same HZSM-5 modified by conventional ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation. As in our previous studies,59 perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen by zinc cations was monitored by low-frequency shifts of HH stretching vibrations detected by DRIFTS.
Experimental Initial hydrogen forms of MFI were prepared by decomposi- tion of ammonium forms in an oxygen flow at 773 K. The cor- responding MFI SM-55 sample with framework Si/Al ratio equal to 25 was obtained from AlsiPenta, while the one with Si/Al  41 was received from Shell. Modification of the zeo- lite with Si/Al  25 was carried out in three different ways.
The first procedure of preparation was wet ion exchange of the ammonium form with 0.02 M aqueous solution of zinc nitrate. After triple exchange (8 h each) the material was washed and dried at 390 K.
The second method of preparation was incipient wetness impregnation of the hydrogen form with an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate also followed by drying at 390 K and calcination in an air flow at 773 K. The resulting zinc content in this case

The third sample was prepared by chemical reaction of the hydrogen form with zinc vapour. In this case the high-tem- perature vacuum prereatment of the starting hydrogen form was also performed in the quartz part of the vacuum cell for optical measurements. The sample was initially heated to 390 K in a vacuum at a heating rate of 2 K min1 and then was kept at this temperature for 2 h. Then, the temperature was raised to 773 K at a rate of 2 K min1 and the sample was evacuated for 2 h more. After that, the zeolite was trans- ferred to the second quartz appendix of the optical cell with the granules of metallic zinc and heated in zinc vapour for 2 h at 773 K. The released molecular hydrogen was collected in a trap with NaX zeolite that was cooled with liquid nitrogen.
The amount of hydrogen was measured volumetrically. To remove excess metallic zinc the modified zeolite was evacuated at the end of the hydrogen evolution for 3 h at 773 K. The zinc content in this sample was equal to 1.92 wt% as detected by absorption spectral analysis (AAS analysis) or calculated from the amount of hydrogen released. A similar preparation proce- dure via reaction with zinc vapour was also used to modify MFI with Si/Al  40 and FAU. The hydrogen form of FAU with Si/Al  2.4 was obtained from AkzoNobel.
Similar to our previous publications,59 DRIFT spectra of the granulated zeolites with dimensions of the grains equal to 0.51 mm were measured in a quartz optical cell at room temperature using a Nicolet Impact 410 spectrophotometer equipped with a home-built diffuse reflectance attachment.
For DRIFT measurements at 77 K the optical cell with the sample was immersed into a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen. Molecular hydrogen was adsorbed at an equilibrium pressure of 1.33  104 Pa, while DRIFTS measurements were performed in the presence of hydrogen over the samples.
All DRIFT spectra were transformed into KubelkaMunk units by a standard program assuming that the reflectance abil- ity of the samples at 5000 cm1 was equal to 0.9. Then the background spectra of zeolites were subtracted from the over- all spectra. The DRIFT spectra of hydroxyl groups and those of zinc hydrides were measured at room temperature through the CaF2 window.
Results Results obtained from the present study are quite surprising.
They indicated that, unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substi- tution of protons by zinc ions. For the zeolite with the frame- work Si/Al ratio equal to 25 this is demonstrated by the spectrum (b) in Fig. 1. DRIFT spectrum (a) in Fig. 1 corre- spond to protons in the initial hydrogen form pre-evacuated at 773 K. In agreement with our previous results,6,7 it contains a narrow DRIFT band at 3610 cm1 from the isolated brid- ging acidic hydroxyl groups and a much weaker band from the silanol groups with the maximum at 3740 cm1. A much broader band with the maximum at 29003600 cm1 also belongs to acidic OH groups that are hydrogen-bonded by the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.
Interaction with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the disap- pearance of the narrow and broad bands (line (b)). This indicates a chemical reaction of both isolated and hydrogen- bonded acidic protons with zinc atoms. The quantitative sub- stitution of acidic protons by zinc ions was also confirmed by AAS analysis of zinc content in the modified zeolite (ca. 2 wt% of zinc) and by the amount of releasing hydrogen that was close to one half of the aluminium content in the sample. In contrast to acidic protons, the reaction with zinc vapour did not change the intensity of DRIFT band from the silanol groups.
Our results also confirmed that the extent of substitution of protons by zinc ions in the samples prepared by incipient wet- ness impregnation or by wet ion exchange is considerably lower than for the reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). In this connection, it should be emphasised, that unlike ion exchange the interaction of protons with zinc vapour is a real chemical reaction that is similar to dilution of metallic zinc in liquid acids. This explains why the reaction with zinc vapour results in the complete substitution of all acidic protons by zinc ions. On the contrary, it looks like ion exchange is easy only for the protons in the next-nearest positions but is more diffi- cult for well separated protons. Incipient wetness impregnation most likely represents an intermediate case when acidic pro- tons are replaced both by ion exchange and by chemical reac- tion with zinc oxide particles resulting from the decomposition of zinc nitrate at elevated temperatures. This may explain a higher extent of substitution of protons by zinc in the sample prepared by incipient wetness impregnation compared with ion exchange.
Similar to our previous studies,59 the modified MFI sam- ples were examined by low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe. The DRIFT spectrum of H2 adsorbed at 77 K by the same HMFI sample as in Fig. 1(a) is shown in Fig. 2(a). In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of OH groups, it also contains the band at 4105 cm1 from HH stretching vibrations of hydrogen perturbed by acidic hydro- xyls with a shoulder at 4125 cm1 from hydrogen perturbed by silanol groups.15 A much weaker band with a maximum at 4180 cm1 belongs to the high-frequency satellite of adsorbed hydrogen, whereas the broad band at 4030 cm1 belongs to hydrogen adsorption by Lewis sites resulting from partial dehydroxylation of the initial hydrogen form upon high-temperature vacuum pretreatment.
In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of hydroxyl groups shown in Fig. 1, the spectrum of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by the zeolite modified via reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 2(b)) also confirms the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions. This follows from the disappearance of the band with the maximum at 4105 cm1 from hydrogen perturbed by acidic hydroxyl groups. On the contrary, similar to Fig. 1, the intensity of the band at 4125 cm1 from hydrogen adsorbed by the silanol groups remains unchanged. Thus,the hydrogen molecular probe confirmed that zinc vapour reacts only with acidic protons.

View Article Online Besides the removal of acidic protons, the chemical reaction with zinc vapour also results in the appearance of two new sites of molecular hydrogen adsorption with HH stretching fre- quencies of 4010 and 3938 cm1. The position of the first of these bands at 4010 cm1 is close to that at 4037 cm1 for molecular hydrogen adsorption by zinc ions at SII sites in ZnFAU prepared by conventional wet ion exchange.8 There- fore, similar to ref. 9 we also ascribe the band with the lower low-frequency shift of HH stretching vibrations to hydrogen interacting with zinc ions localized in the six- or five-membered rings of the MFI framework, each containing two aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra per ring. In agreement with the above-mentioned theoretical calculations,1011 the number of such sites in the zeolite with an Si/Al ratio of 25 is only a minor fraction of the total aluminium content. It has also been suggested that the more intense and more strongly red- shifted band at 3938 cm1 belongs to hydrogen adsorbed by zinc ions localized at well separated negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra.6,9 Similar HH stretching bands very strongly shifted toward low frequencies were previously observed by us for hydrogen adsorption by Zn- and Co-modified samples prepared by inci- pient wetness impregnation in refs. 57. It was also concluded in those papers that the fraction of ion pairs with the distantly separated zinc cations and basic sites with cationic vacancies was increasing for zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios. Therefore,in the present study we also investigated hydrogen adsorption by MFI with the higher framework Si/Al ratio equal to 40 that was also modified by the high-temperature reaction with zinc vapour.
The corresponding DRIFT spectra are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, in this case the relative intensity of the band from the most strongly perturbed adsorbed hydrogen is higher. This indicates an increasing fraction of the above-mentioned unusual Zn2 ions. It should also be emphasized that the frequency of this band is slightly lower than for the sample with Si/Al  25. This is probably associated with the stronger separation of aluminium atoms in the zeolite framework with the higher Si/Al ratio.
Similar to our previous observations,9 at temperatures only slightly above room temperature, the most strongly perturbed hydrogen molecules are involved in heterolytic dissociative adsorption resulting in the appearance of a DRIFT band from Zn hydrides with the maximum at 1934 cm1 (Fig. 4) and in the partial regeneration of the narrow and broad bands from acidic hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5). The intensities of all these bands are increasing with an increase in the temperature of hydrogen adsorption.
Fig. 6 shows the DRIFT spectra of molecular hydrogen adsorbed at 77 K by the same sample preheated before DRIFTS measurements in a hydrogen atmosphere at the same temperatures as in Figs. 4 and 5. Upon heating in hydrogen,the intensity of the band with the maximum at 3938 cm1 decreases, while the band at 4010 cm1 remains unchanged.
This indicates that the dissociative hydrogen adsorption only takes place on sites with stronger perturbation of adsorbed H2 molecules. On the contrary, dissociation on sites with weaker hydrogen perturbation did not take place.
DRIFT spectra of molecular hydrogen adsorbed at 77 K on the samples prepared by incipient wetness impregnation or by wet ion exchange are shown in Figs. 7(a) and (b). Their com- parison with Fig. 2 indicates that the fraction of the sites with the stronger perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen for both these preparation procedures is lower than for the reaction with zinc vapour. Moreover, for the incipient wetness impregnation, the fraction of such sites is also somewhat higher than for ion exchange. Both these conclusions are in agreement with more complete substitution of protons by chemical reaction with zinc vapour that was indicated by DRIFT spectra of hydroxyl groups in Figs. 1 and 2.

View Article Online Since ZnMFI is known as a catalyst for paraffin dehydro- genation, we also tested the state of zinc ions by methane adsorption at room temperature. Comparison of the obtained DRIFT spectra for methane adsorption by ZnFAU and by ZnMFI with Si/Al  25 both prepared by interaction of hydrogen forms with zinc vapour is shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). DRIFT bands with maxima at 3016 and 3001 cm1 belong to asymmetric

vibrations of gaseous and weakly adsorbed methane, respectively. Much stronger low frequency shifted broad bands at 2861 and 2806 cm1 are due to stronger methane adsorption by the modifying zinc cations in ZnFAU and ZnMFI, respectively. Similar to hydrogen adsorption, the red shift of the low-frequency band for methane adsorbed by ZnMFI is much greater than for adsorption by ZnFAU. This also indicates similar stronger perturbation of adsorbed methane by well separated Zn2 ions in the MFI framework.
Discussion It has been suggested in our previous work that bivalent zinc ions most strongly perturbing adsorbed hydrogen molecules are well separated from each other.9 The main argument sup- porting this conclusion was the higher fraction of such sites in zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios. The results of the present study provide even better support of this model. Indeed, the complete substitution of protons in MFI by chemical reaction with zinc vapour should be considered as a strong argument against the localization of Zn2 ions only at paired aluminium sites at the next-nearest positions, since in the zeolite with Si/ Al  25 the number of such sites is certainly much less than the total aluminium content. Therefore, in addition to the sta- bilization of bivalent cations at two oxygenaluminium tetra- hedra in the next-nearest positions, some of the zinc ions are also localized at sites with larger distances between negative lattice charges. As discussed in ref. 9, such localization most likely corresponds to the following structure with alternating positive and negative electric charges:2AlO2H  Zn0 ! AlO2Zn2  AlO2  H2 1 In this case bivalent zinc cations are stabilized at isolated oxy- gen tetrahedra occupied by aluminium with single negative charges creating the sites with only partially compensated positive charges. Due to the requirement of electroneutrality,bivalent cations can occupy only up to one half of distantly separated negative sites. The equivalent amount of alumi- niumoxygen tetrahedra remains cationically vacant. Their negative electric charges are compensated in an indirect way Fig. 5 DRIFT spectra of hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at a pressure of 1.33  104 Pa by the same zinc modified MFI as in Fig. 4: (a) before hydrogen adsorption;(b) after hydrogen adsorption at room temperature; (c) after heating of the sample in hydrogen at 373 K; (d) after heating of the sample in hydrogen at 473 K.

View Article Online by electrostatic interaction with the surrounding excessively positively charged cations. In addition, due to the random dis- tribution of aluminium in the MFI framework, some of the zinc cations are also localized at the conventional ion-exchange sites with two aluminium atoms in the next-nearest positions.
The fraction of such sites should decrease at the higher Si/Al ratios.
In this connection, it should be emphasized that the com- plete substitution in MFI of protons by zinc cations could be by no means explained by the formation of the bridging [ZnOZn] oxo-ions or of dimeric [ZnZn]2 ions similar to those that have been suggested for the MFI zeolites modified by Cu2 16 or Cd2 ions:17 (eqns. (2) or (3)):2AlO2H  Zn O ! AlO2Zn O Zn2AlO2  H2O 2 or 2AlO2H  Zn Zn2 ! AlO2Zn Zn2AlO2  H2 3 For the zinc-modified zeolites, the formation of such species is inconsistent with a zinc content of 2 wt% at the complete sub- stitution of protons by zinc that was experimentally detected in the present study by AAS or by the amount of hydrogen released. Indeed, as follows from eqns. (2) and (3), for the dimeric species the zinc content should be twice that for our charge alternating model (1) i.e. should correspond to Zn/Al  1 or to a zinc content of 4 wt%.
Thus, our charge-alternating model provides a new concept for the localization of charge-compensating multivalent ions in high-silica zeolites. This possibility has never been discussed before, although similar structures with alternating excessive positive and negative charges in monometallic and mixed oxi- des with different charges of cations and lattice oxygen have been known for a long time. Well-known examples of such structures are aluminium oxide, layered alumina silicates,spinels, etc.
The unusually large red shifts of HH stretching vibrations created by such acidbase pairs with well separated zinc Lewis sites and negatively charged basic oxygen should be explained by very strong perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen by the zinc cations with only partially compensated positive electric charges. Moreover, at room temperature or slightly higher such sites dissociatively adsorb molecular hydrogen according to the following equation: AlO2Zn2  AlO2  H2 ! AlO2Zn2H  AlO2H 4 As shown in Fig. 5, this results in the partial regeneration of the DRIFT band from acidic hydroxyl groups with the maxi- mum at 3610 cm1 and in the appearance of the band from zinc hydrides at 1934 cm1 (Fig. 4). Comparison of Figs. 5 and 6 clearly indicates that the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen does not take place on the sites with weaker hydro- gen perturbation but only occurs on zinc ions most strongly perturbing molecular hydrogen. Therefore, the amount of acidic protons regenerated by dissociative adsorption can be used for estimating the number of such unusual zinc ions.
Indeed, for the sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociative adsorption should be one half of that in the initial hydrogen form of the same zeolite. As follows from comparison of Figs. 1 and 5,for the zeolite with Si/Al  25 prepared by reaction of protons with zinc vapour, the corresponding amount of regenerated protons observed in our experiments was about 2530% of the initial number of protons. This indicates a considerable fraction of unusual zinc ions close to about 60%.
The stretching frequency of the resulting zinc hydrides is higher by more than 200 cm1 than that of 1710 cm1 for hydrides produced by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on ZnO.18 This is most likely due to stronger polarization of the ZnH bond by zinc ions with only partially compensated positive charges. At elevated temperatures the extent of such heterolytic dissociative adsorption increases resulting in higher intensity bands from hydrides and acidic protons.
Conclusion Our results on the complete substitution of protons by bivalent zinc ions in MFI frameworks with very high Si/Al ratios pre- sent experimental evidence for the first time of the new charge- alternating model of localization of bivalent transition metal cations at well separated negatively charged aluminium atoms.
For the high-silica zeolites this model is quite new, although similar structures with local alternation of excessive positive and negative charges forming a large number of monometallic and mixed-metal oxides with different cation valences and lat- tice oxygen have been well-known for a long time. The unusual nature of zinc ions at such sites was confirmed by DRIFT spectra of adsorbed molecular hydrogen and methane and by dissociative adsorption of hydrogen at relatively low temperatures.
