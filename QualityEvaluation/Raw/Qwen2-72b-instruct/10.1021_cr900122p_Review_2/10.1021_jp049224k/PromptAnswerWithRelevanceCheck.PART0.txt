How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

However, it does discuss the role of zinc ions in ZnZSM-5 zeolite in the adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane, indicating that the presence of zinc ions can inhibit cracking and increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization in the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics. The study shows that zinc ions can polarize the CH stretching mode of ethane, leading to its heterolytic dissociation and dehydrogenation at moderately elevated temperatures. This selective polarization of chemical bonds involved in subsequent dissociative adsorption by the active sites provides a unique opportunity for discussion of selectivity of heterogeneous acid catalysis at the molecular level.

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the modification of HZSM-5 zeolites with Zn2+ ions, which inhibits the cracking of olefinic oligomers and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization. The study of the state of zinc ions in high-silica zeolites has been a subject of numerous recent publications. The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by zinc cations. The results indicated that the unusual DRIFT spectrum of the molecular form of ethane adsorption by zinc cations represents a first example of anisotropy of polarizability of adsorbed molecules, which may provide a new explanation for selectivity of the acid-catalyzed reactions.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息，但确实讨论了HZSM-5沸石用Zn2+离子改性，这抑制了烯烃寡聚物的裂化，提高了芳构化的速率和选择性。最近的许多出版物都以研究高硅沸石中锌离子的状态为主题。目前工作的主要目标是对锌离子的激活和解离吸附乙烷进行DRIFT（漫反射红外傅里叶变换）研究。结果表明，锌离子分子形式乙烷吸附的异常DRIFT光谱是吸附分子极化各向异性的第一个例子，这可能为酸催化反应的选择性提供新的解释。
