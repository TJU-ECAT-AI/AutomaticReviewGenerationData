How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, with particular attention paid to recent studies of a gas-phase oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics by dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, and the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix are discussed as factors that contribute to the efficiency of the reaction. The specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant and the reaction mechanism are also discussed.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂(包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石)的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。但是,它确实讨论了沸石作为选择性氧化反应催化剂的使用,特别关注了最近关于二氮化一氧化氮气相氧化芳烃的研究。对于一个简单的反应,即在Fe含量ZSM-5沸石上苯的氧化生成酚,获得了最好的结果。该反应在25-30%的苯转化率下几乎达到100%的选择性。沸石的催化活性的本质、铁的作用以及沸石基质的化学组成被讨论为影响反应效率的因素。二氮化一氧化氮作为氧化剂的特殊性质和反应机制也被讨论。
