[2] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special afnity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way."
[3] "Such a low value of qa seems to be incompatible with the high thermal stability of Oa. This may be explained by the fact that a-sites are separated from each other by high energy barriers that prevents the surface diffusion and recombination of Oa atoms."
[4] "The isolated spatial position of a-sites is also in agreement with the fact that Oa can not be loaded using NO, though thermodynamically this molecule is close to N2O."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3. The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way. The a-sites are separated from each other by high energy barriers that prevent the surface diffusion and recombination of Oa atoms. Oa can not be loaded using NO, as the mechanism of NO decomposition is more complex, and contrary to N2O, dissociation of NO cannot occur on an isolated center. The concentration ratio of a-sites to iron atoms (Ca : CFe) depends on the iron content in the zeolite and on conditions of its activation, reaching for some cases the value of 1:2, which is the upper limit if the hypothesis of binuclear structure of a-sites is true. Active Fe is not observed by the ESR, which is in agreement with an assumption of diamagnetic binuclear complexes. Experimentally, observed characteristics of a-oxygen can be explained by binuclear quantum chemical model of a-sites. Mo ssbauer spectral parameters for FeZSM-5 fall into the range typical for oxo-bridged binuclear Fe complexes. Depending on the conditions, MMO iron can exist in either a reduced or an oxidized state. Each of these states gives rise to the respective quadruple doublet. Similar to MMO, the sample contains two states of Fe. The narrow doublet corresponds to Fe3, while the wide doublet corresponds to Fe2, which is the main state of the iron before Oa loading. Loading the sample with a-oxygen leads to a dramatic change in the state of iron caused by the oxidation of Fe2 into Fe3. Interpretation of the resulting spectrum indicates either the appearance of two states of Fe3, or non-equivalence of the ligand environment of two Fe3 ions of the same complex. There is a excellent agreement between the spectral parameters of both the reduced and oxidized states of iron in 57FeZSM-5 to that of di-iron MMO complexes. The oxygen atom of a-site may have the same kind of stabilization between two iron atoms as in bis-m- oxodi-iron active intermediate proposed for MMO.

These factors contribute to their industrial significance.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。铁原子在ZSM-5基质中获得与自由Fe2O3完全不同的特性。铁失去了激活O2的能力，但获得了对一氧化二氮的特殊亲和力，导致其以特殊方式分解。a位点彼此之间由高能垒隔开，防止了Oa原子的表面扩散和重组。无法使用NO加载Oa，因为NO分解的机制更复杂，与N2O相反，NO的分解不能在孤立的中心发生。a位点与铁原子的浓度比(Ca : CFe)取决于沸石中的铁含量和其活化条件，在某些情况下达到1:2的值，如果假设a位点的二核结构，这是上限。活性Fe在ESR中未被观察到，这与假设的顺磁性二核复合物一致。实验观察到的a-氧特性可以通过a位点的二核量子化学模型来解释。FeZSM-5的Mo ssbauer光谱参数落入二铁MMO复合物的典型范围内。根据条件，MMO铁可以存在于还原或氧化状态。每种状态都会产生相应的四重双线。与MMO类似，样品含有两种Fe状态。窄双线对应Fe3，而宽双线对应Fe2，这是铁在Oa加载前的主要状态。将样品加载a-氧会导致铁状态的剧烈变化，由Fe2氧化为Fe3引起。对结果光谱的解释表明，要么出现两种Fe3状态，要么同一复合物中两个Fe3离子的配体环境不等价。57FeZSM-5中还原和氧化铁状态的光谱参数与二铁MMO复合物的光谱参数有很好的一致性。a位点的氧原子可能与为MMO提出的双m- oxodi-铁活性中间体中的两个铁原子具有相同的稳定化作用。对于这种中间体，双m-oxo Fe(IV)和Fe(III) oxenic形式之间的氧化还原平衡是可能的。在MMO中，Fe周围的配体环境较软，这导致Fe(IV)的稳定化，并将平衡向左移动。在FeZSM-5的较硬配体环境中，Fe(IV)的稳定化不受青睐，平衡向更反应性的oxenic形式移动。甲烷氧化的机制a-氧在ZSM-5基质中的铁复合物显示，该系统是MMO催化循环中影响烷烃羟基化的活性feroxo-中间体的新成功模型。MMO中烷烃羟基化的普遍接受机制假设活性feroxo-中间体与烷烃的相互作用遵循消除-加成路线。通过5-配位的碳中间态直接将氧原子插入甲烷CH键也是可能的。在MMO和细胞色素P-450对芳烃的羟基化中，观察到的KIE接近于1。对于细胞色素P-450，假设反应通过不稳定的芳烃-氧化物的初始形成进行，这些氧化物可以自发异构化为酚类产物。在许多情况下，已经分离出芳烃氧化物中间体。值得注意的是，形成此类中间体应该没有同位素效应，因为没有涉及CH键的断裂。提出了类似的机制用于苯氧化a-氧，并通过以下方案说明。与单加氧酶相似的KIE的缺乏表明，涉及CH键断裂的步骤(2)应该是快速的，而步骤(1)是速率限制的。这些因素对它们的工业意义有贡献。
