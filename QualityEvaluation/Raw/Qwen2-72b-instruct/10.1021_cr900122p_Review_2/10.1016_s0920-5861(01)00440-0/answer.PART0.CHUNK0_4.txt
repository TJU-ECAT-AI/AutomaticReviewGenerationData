1.The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products such as CO and CO2. Methane can be activated over M/MOn/MO multi-component catalysts to form benzene and/or carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over a supported Pt catalyst via a two-step route. Methane can be aromatized to benzene over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as one of the good catalysts for methane conversion. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru, and Cu can improve the activity or stability of catalysts. Catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

1.甲烷催化脱氢缩合到苯和萘在过渡金属支撑的沸石催化剂上是甲烷催化转化的一种策略。间接过程依赖于合成气的生产，随后是费托化学。直接转化路线用于形成甲醇和甲醛。甲烷中CH键的裂解可能由于CH4和表面氧物种之间的相互作用。许多与甲烷转化相关的工艺需要使用氧气，导致甲烷的深度氧化。为了抑制CO和CO2等不希望产物的形成，研究人员试图在无氧条件下将甲烷转化为更高级的烃类。甲烷可以在M/MOn/MO多组分催化剂上活化，形成苯和/或碳沉积物。甲烷可以通过支撑的Pt催化剂两步路线转化为更高级的烃类。甲烷可以在PtCrO3/HZSM-5催化剂上芳构化为苯。甲烷可以在非氧化条件下，在过渡金属离子支撑的HZSM-5催化剂的流动模式反应器中转化为苯。Mo/HZSM-5通常被认为是一种良好的甲烷转化催化剂。已经研究了过渡金属离子、制备和处理方法对催化剂的影响。WH2SO4/HZSM-5是高温下甲烷芳构化的良好催化剂，但忽视了焦炭的形成。添加Fe、Co、W、Zr、Ru和Cu可以提高催化剂的活性或稳定性。在沸石微孔方面对催化剂进行了大量研究。已经研究了不同类型的沸石上Mo基催化剂的甲烷芳构化。
