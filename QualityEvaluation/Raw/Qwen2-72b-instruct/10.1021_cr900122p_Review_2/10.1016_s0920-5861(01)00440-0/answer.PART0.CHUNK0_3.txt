1.The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied.

1.在过渡金属支撑的沸石催化剂上，甲烷催化脱氢缩合生成苯和萘是甲烷催化转化的一种策略。碳沉积物的调查，过渡金属组分与沸石载体之间的协同效应，活性物种和反应机理通过各种研究揭示。许多与甲烷转化相关的工艺需要使用氧气，导致甲烷的深度氧化。为了抑制不期望产物的生成，研究人员尝试在无氧条件下将甲烷转化为更高级的烃类。Mo/HZSM-5通常被认为是一种良好的催化剂。添加Fe，Co，W，Zr，Ru和Cu可以增强催化剂的活性或稳定性。在过去的8年里，沸石微孔的催化剂改性得到了广泛的研究。
