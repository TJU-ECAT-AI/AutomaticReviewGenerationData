[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "The indirect processes rely upon the production of synthesis gas, either by reforming reaction or by partial oxidation, followed by FischerTropsch chemistry."
[3] "For the latter transformation route, methane can be converted to the desired products, e.g. ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics, directly."
[4] "The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for the direct conversion of methane had been extensively studied since 1982."
[5] "Many processes related with methane conversion,whether direct or indirect route, require the use of oxygen, so the deep oxidation of methane is unavoidable."
[6] "In order to suppress the formation of undesirable products such as CO and CO2, many researchers tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen."
[7] "Mitchell and Wanyhorne [8] reported that methane could be activated over M/MOn/MO multi-component catalyst at 977 K to form benzene and/or the carbonaceous deposit."
[8] "Belgued et al. [9] demonstrated that methane could be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over a supported Pt catalyst via a two-step route."
[9] "Bragin et al. [10] found the aromatization reaction of methane to benzene over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalyst at 1023 K in a pulse-reactor."
[10] "In 1993, Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."
[11] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21],and Liu et al. [22,23]."
[12] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method."
[13] "They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."
[14] "Later, Zeng et al. [27] reported the WH2SO4/HZSM-5 was a good catalyst for methane aromatization at 1123 K, however,the formation of coke was neglected."
[15] "On the other hand, it should be noted that the addition of a sec- ond metal component is also studied as shown in [12]."
[16] "The improvement in enhancing activity or stability has been obtained by addition with Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu [22,2831]."
[17] "During the past 8 years, the catalyst modification in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied [23,3237]."
[18] "Some of typical results are listed in Table 1. Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]."

1.The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely on the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry.

The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to deep oxidation of methane.

Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for methane conversion. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. Catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites have been studied for methane aromatization.

1.甲烷催化脱氢缩合至苯和萘在过渡金属支撑的沸石催化剂上是甲烷催化转化的一种策略。甲烷转化的间接过程依赖于合成气的生产，随后是费托化学。甲烷可以直接转化为乙烯、甲醇、甲醛和芳烃等所需产品。自1982年以来，甲烷的氧化偶联作为直接转化的替代途径得到了广泛的研究。与甲烷转化相关的许多过程都需要使用氧气，导致甲烷的深度氧化。为了抑制不期望产物的形成，研究人员试图在无氧条件下将甲烷转化为更高碳的烃类。甲烷可以在多组分催化剂上被激活，形成苯和碳沉积物。甲烷可以通过支撑的Pt催化剂通过两步路线转化为更高碳的烃类。甲烷在PtCrO3/HZSM-5催化剂上可以被芳构化为苯。甲烷可以在过渡金属离子支撑的HZSM-5催化剂的非氧化条件下在流动模式反应器中转化为苯。Mo/HZSM-5通常被认为是一种良好的甲烷转化催化剂。过渡金属离子对甲烷芳构化的活性顺序为：Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr。WH2SO4/HZSM-5是甲烷芳构化的良好催化剂，但忽视了焦炭的形成。添加第二种金属组分已被研究以增强活性或稳定性。在沸石微孔方面对催化剂进行了大量研究。不同类型的沸石支撑的Mo基催化剂已被研究用于甲烷芳构化。
