1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity are also important factors. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，在烷烃转化的机制和效率中起着重要作用，特别是对于选择性氧化过程。钒是烷烃选择性氧化催化剂中的首选元素。将钒离子隔离在准惰性基质中是至关重要的。产物的稳定性、多功能性、C-H键活化类型以及酸性和碱性的作用都是重要因素。多功能性可以作为催化剂设计的标准，也可以作为解释反应机制的工具，但仅凭多功能性是不够的。
