1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is significant. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, type of C-H bond activation, and acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of the reactions. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.
