          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，在烷烃转化的机制和效率中起着重要作用。钒是选择性氧化烷烃催化剂的首选元素。将钒离子隔离在准惰性基质中是至关重要的。产物的稳定性、多功能性、C-H键活化类型以及酸性和碱性的作用也对这些过程的效率有贡献。多功能性可以作为催化剂设计的标准，并作为解释反应机制的工具，但仅此是不够的。这些因素对于氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的工业重要性是必不可少的。
