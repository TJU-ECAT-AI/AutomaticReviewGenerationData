[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[4] "In this way, although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ-Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts affects both the catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. Catalysts with higher vanadium loading show increased catalytic activity but may have lower selectivity to the corresponding olefins. The nature of the active sites, such as tetrahedral or octahedral V5+ species, impacts the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions. The number and type of acid sites, including Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with vanadium loading. Various physicochemical methods have been used to characterize vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3, revealing that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium content. The appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoretical monolayer, while at lower loadings, isolated and associated tetrahedral and octahedral V5+ species are observed. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting their performance in alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如支撑的钒氧化物,对烷烃转化的机理和氧化脱氢过程的效率有重大影响。在γ-Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上,钒的负载量影响正丁烷和乙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性和选择性。具有较高钒负载量的催化剂表现出较高的催化活性,但可能对相应的烯烃有较低的选择性。活性位点的性质,如四面体或八面体V5+物种,影响对氧脱氢反应的选择性。酸位点的数量和类型,包括Lewis和Brnsted酸位点,也随钒负载量的变化而变化。使用各种物理化学方法对支撑在Al2O3上的钒催化剂进行了表征,结果表明,钒物种的类型取决于钒含量。在Al2O3上出现V2O5晶体的钒负载量约为理论单层的60%,而在较低的负载量下,观察到孤立和相关的四面体和八面体V5+物种。这些因素通过影响这些催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能,对这些催化剂的工业意义产生了影响。
