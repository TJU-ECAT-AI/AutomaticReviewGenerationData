[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."
[2] "The vana- dium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3- supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."
[3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
[4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
[5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
[6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
[7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
[8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
[9] "The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts affects both the catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane. Higher vanadium loading increases catalytic activity but may decrease selectivity to the corresponding olefins. Selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products is influenced by the type of alkane, with ethane showing higher selectivity than n-butane. The nature of vanadium species, whether tetrahedral or octahedral, also impacts the catalytic behavior, with tetrahedral species showing higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions. The number and type of acid sites on the catalyst, which vary with vanadium loading, play a role in the catalytic performance. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the optimization of reaction conditions for specific alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构，如支撑的钒氧化物，在氧化脱氢过程中对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。在γ-Al2O3支撑的催化剂上，钒的负载量影响了乙烷和正丁烷氧化脱氢的催化活性和选择性。较高的钒负载量虽然提高了催化活性，但可能会降低对相应烯烃的选择性。对氧化脱氢产物的选择性受烷烃类型的影响，乙烷的选择性高于正丁烷。钒物种的类型，无论是四面体还是八面体，也影响催化行为，四面体物种对氧化脱氢反应显示出更高的选择性。催化剂上酸位点的数量和类型，随钒负载量的变化而变化，对催化性能起着作用。这些因素通过使反应条件针对特定的烷烃转化进行优化，对这些催化剂的工业意义做出了贡献。

The appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoretical monolayer, while at lower loadings, isolated and associated tetrahedral and octahedral V5+ species are observed. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting their performance in alkane transformations.

The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane. Catalysts with lower vanadium loading (less than 5 wt%) show associated VO4 tetrahedra, while those with higher loading exhibit VO6 octahedra. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species have higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species.
