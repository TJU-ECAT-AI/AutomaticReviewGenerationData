[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
[5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
[6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
[7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如支撑的钒氧化物，在氧化脱氢过程中对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。γ -Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上的钒负载量对n-丁烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢的催化行为有重大影响。催化活性随钒负载量的增加而增加，但对相应烯烃的选择性在3-4 wt% V原子的催化剂上达到最大。在丁烷的氧化脱氢过程中，对氧脱氢产物的选择性低于在乙烷的氧化脱氢过程中对乙烯的选择性。钒物种的类型，如VO4四面体或VO6八面体，取决于钒含量，较低的V负载量的催化剂上观察到四面体V5+物种，而较高的V负载量的催化剂上主要观察到八面体V5+物种。具有八面体V5+物种的催化剂显示出较高的催化活性，但在主要具有四面体V5+物种的催化剂上，对氧脱氢反应的选择性较高。酸位点的数量和性质，如Lewis和Brnsted酸位点，也随钒负载量的变化而变化。钒物种的类型和酸位点的性质通过影响烷烃转化的选择性和活性，对这些催化剂的工业意义有贡献。
