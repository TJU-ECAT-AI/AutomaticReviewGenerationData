1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane. Catalysts with lower vanadium loading (less than 5 wt%) show associated VO4 tetrahedra, while those with higher loading exhibit VO6 octahedra. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species have higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites also change with vanadium loading, with Lewis acid sites observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, and both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on catalysts with high V loading.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如支撑的钒氧化物,对烷烃转化的机理和氧化脱氢过程的效率有重大影响。γ -Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物催化剂上的钒负载量影响n-丁烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢的催化行为。催化活性随钒负载量的增加而增加,但对相应烯烃的选择性在3-4 wt% V原子的催化剂上达到最大。在丁烷的ODH中,对氧脱氢产物的选择性低于在乙烷的ODH中对乙烯的选择性。在钒负载量较低(小于5 wt%)的催化剂上观察到相关的VO4四面体,而在负载量较高的催化剂上则出现VO6八面体。虽然具有八面体V5+物种的催化剂具有更高的催化活性,但在主要具有四面体V5+物种的催化剂上实现了对氧脱氢反应的更高选择性。酸性位点的数量和性质也随钒负载量的变化而变化,在钒负载量较低的催化剂上主要观察到路易斯酸性位点,而在钒负载量较高的催化剂上则观察到路易斯和布隆斯特酸性位点。
