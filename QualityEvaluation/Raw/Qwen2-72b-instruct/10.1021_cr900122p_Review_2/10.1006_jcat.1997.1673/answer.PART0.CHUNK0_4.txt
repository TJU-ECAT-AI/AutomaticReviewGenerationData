[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."
[2] "The vana- dium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3- supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."

[4] "In this way, although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly impact the efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts influences both the activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. Higher vanadium loading increases catalytic activity but may decrease selectivity to olefins. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher activity, whereas those with tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions. The nature of acid sites, which can be Lewis or Brønsted, also varies with vanadium loading, affecting the catalytic behavior. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the optimization of reaction conditions for desired product yields.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构，如支撑的钒氧化物，对烷烃转化过程中氧化脱氢反应的效率有重大影响。在γ-Al2O3支撑的催化剂上，钒的负载量对n-丁烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢的活性和选择性都有影响。较高的钒负载量虽然增加了催化活性，但可能会降低对烯烃的选择性。具有八面体V5+物种的催化剂表现出更高的活性，而具有四面体V5+物种的催化剂对氧化脱氢反应显示出更高的选择性。酸位点的性质，可以是路易斯酸或布朗斯特酸，也随着钒负载量的变化而变化，影响催化行为。这些因素通过使反应条件优化以获得所需的产品产量，对这些催化剂的工业意义做出了贡献。
