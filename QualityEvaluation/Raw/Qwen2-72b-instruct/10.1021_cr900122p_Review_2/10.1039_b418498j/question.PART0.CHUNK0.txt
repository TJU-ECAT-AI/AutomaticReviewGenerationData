r-Type ethane adsorption complexes with Cu1 ions in Cu(I)-ZSM-5 zeolite. Combined DRIFTS and DFT study Evgeny Pidko* and Vladimir Kazansky Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Leninsky prospect 47,119991 Moscow, Russia. E-mail: pidkoevg@rambler.ru Received 9th December 2004, Accepted 15th March 2005 First published as an Advance Article on the web 23rd March 2005 A DRIFTS study of ethane adsorption by the univalent copper cations in Cu(I)-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by chemical reaction of the corresponding hydrogen form (Si/Al  150) with CuCl vapour at 573 K reveals an unusual spectrum of adsorbed C2H6. In addition to the weakly perturbed narrow bands in the region of CH stretching vibrations, the spectrum exhibits two broad IR bands whose frequencies are lowered more than by 300 cm1 compared to the CH stretching vibrations of gaseous or physically adsorbed ethane. This indicates unusually strong perturbation of adsorbed C2H6 molecules by Cu1 ions, which has never been observed before for ethane adsorption on oxides or on any other cationic form of zeolites. Despite such a strong perturbation, the adsorbed ethane molecules are not involved in heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures. DFT cluster modeling of ethane interaction with Cu1 stabilized at a-sites (the six-membered ring composed of two five-membered rings from the straight wall of the ZSM-5 zeolite) as possible adsorption sites indicated that C2H6 interaction with Cu1 results in formation of rather strong s-type adsorption complexes. The results obtained indicated that the most preferential adsorption geometry is when the alkane bound in an end-on fashion through two hydrogen atoms of one of the methyl groups. The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals. Both these interactions result in a very strong weakening of the CH bonds and, therefore, in a very large bathochromic shift of the CH stretching frequencies of methyl group contacting with Cu1 ion.
Introduction Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen.13 This system also exhibits very unusual adsorption properties resulting in for- mation of very strong adsorption complexes of the univalent copper with N2,4,5 or CO.6 The copper adsorption centers could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]21 species or directly by high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl vapour at elevated temperature.48 The quantum chemical calculations911 demonstrated, that such unusual properties of reduced CuZSM-5 can be related to the electron donor properties of Cu1 species, which, in turn, call forth very strong activation of adsorbed molecules.
Recently, another very unusual adsorption property of CuZSM-5 zeolites has been reported by Serykh and Kazansky in refs. 12 and 13. They found that adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 results in more than 1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the HH stretching vibration,which has never been observed before for H2 adsorbed by any other cationic forms of zeolites or by oxides.
On the other hand, during the last 20 years a great number of compounds have been reported for oxidative addition of H2 to transition metal complexes which contain intact molecular dihydrogen.1422 These systems constitute a special class of s-bond complexes. The vibrational properties of the MH2 moiety in these systems1517,20 are very similar to those ob- served in the case of H2 adsorption by CuZSM-5 zeolite in refs. 12 and 13. Most likely, the bonding of adsorbed H2 with Cu1 cations could be reasonable described in the similar way as in the above mentioned hydrogen transition metal complexes.
Indeed, analysis of the components of the adsorption energy of H2 by Cu1 cations, carried out within the cluster approach by Solans-Monfort et al.,23 revealed the s-bonding of adsorbed hydrogen. In this case the electron donation from the H2(sg) bonding orbital to the partially occupied Cu(4s) orbital com- bined with the electron back-donation from the (3dp) Cu1 orbital to the antibonding H2(s* u) orbital and also the orbital polarization play a significant role in the H2 adsorption energy,and cause the above mentioned very large bathochromic HH frequency shift.
Our recent investigations of hydrogen or light alkanes adsorption by different cationic forms of zeolites2429 showed that the ion exchanged transition metal cations usually exhibit very similar adsorption properties both with respect to H2 and to light paraffin adsorption (see for instance refs. 26 and 28).
However, most of these works were aimed on the interaction of adsorbed molecules with the strong Lewis acids when no s-type complexes were formed upon adsorption.
Although many H2 s-complexes have been previously re- ported, no similar series of the stable complexes with transition metals have been obtained for light alkanes.30,31 All the alkane complexes so far detected are unstable at room temperature and rather specialized methods are required for their prepara- tion and detection. Indeed, the first examples of alkane co- ordination by transition metals were reported for application of the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of the d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M  Cr, Mo, W).32,33 The coordination of alkanes to the M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by the transient absorption technique in solution and in the gas phase in refs. 3436. More recently, the coordination of methane by naked transition metal atoms has been directly observed in the low temperature matrices.

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue transition metal complexes have also revealed the formation of alkane complexes as reaction intermediates.31,37 The complexes with light alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical calculations in refs. 31 and 38, both as intermediates in CH activation, or as independent entities. Many examples of intramolecular agostic complexes have been reported either for transition metal complexes containing long-chain alkyl ligands31 or for saturated hydrocarbons grafted to transition metal oxides.39 In the present study we report the results of the combined DRIFTS and DFT study of ethane adsorption by Cu(I)-ZSM- 5 zeolite. The interest in Cu1 as a compensating ion in zeolite framework is firstly connected with its ability to form the very unusual s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and,secondly, with its high affinity to light alkanes. As shown by the gas-phase DFT calculations, CH4Cu1 binding energy is equal to 16.821.43 kcal mol1.40 This is significantly larger than that for the other cations, such as Li1 (8.2 kcal mol1)38 or Mg21 (7.6 kcal mol1).41 Experimental The SN-300 ZSM-5 zeolite from Alsi Penta with an Si/Al ratio in the framework of about 150 was prepared by decom- position of the corresponding ammonium form in flowing oxygen at 773 K. A high Si/Al ratio was actually chosen in order to minimize the interaction between copper species inside the zeolite channels after completion of the exchange reaction.
By the analogy with the procedure previously described in ref. 8, the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample was prepared directly by reaction of HZSM-5 with the CuCl vapour at 573 K. This was done in the same quartz optical cell that was subsequently used for recordings of DRIFT spectra. For this purpose the cell was equipped with a side-arm with CaF2 window and an appendix, containing CuCl (Merck), previously outgassed at 473 K in order to remove any traces of water. At first, the zeolite was heated in vacuum at 393 K for 2 h with the rate of preliminary temperature increase of 2 K min1. Then the temperature was raised to 773 K with the same heating rate and the sample was evacuated for 2 h more at this temperature.
Subsequently HZSM-5 was transferred to the appendix with CuCl and then heated at 573 K in vacuum. At the end of HCl evolution the modified zeolite was transferred into the main part of the quartz cell and heated in vacuum at 773 K for 2 h more to remove the excess of copper chloride.
Similar to our previous publications, DRIFT spectra of the granulated zeolite with dimensions of grains of 0.51 mm were measured using a Nicolet Impact 410 spectrophotometer equipped with a home-made diffuse reflectance attachment.
The spectra were recorded at room temperature trough the CaF2 window. All spectra were transformed into Kubelka Munk units by a standard program assuming that the reflec- tance ability of the samples at 5000 cm1 was equal to 0.9.
Then the background created by the zeolite was subtracted from the overall spectra.
Ethane was purified by a triple vacuum distillation after freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature. Adsorption of ethane was carried out at room temperature at different equilibrium pressures. DRIFT measurements were performed both in presence and in absence of C2H6 over the sample.
The quantum chemical calculations were carried out within the gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) using the GAUSSIAN-98 program.42 The hybrid B3LYP43 func- tional was used, since it gives acceptable values for molecular energies and geometries.44 All of the calculations were per- formed using a standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all atoms of the cluster and of adsorbed ethane species.
As a possible site for Cu1 localization the six-membered ring composed of two five-membered rings on the walls of the straight channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite (the a-site) was chosen.
Localization of Cu1 at this site has been suggested since it has been proposed by experimentalists45 to explain unusual cata- lytic and chemical properties of high-silica zeolites. Also, Nachtigallova et al.46 have shown theoretically using the QM-pot approach that this site is among the most stable.
The CuAlSi6O8H*12 cluster shown in Fig. 1 was chosen for our model DFT calculations. Below this structure will be desig- nated as Cu1Z. Hydrogen atoms (H*) were used to saturate the dangling SiO bonds at the border of the cluster. The starting geometry of the cluster corresponds to the real lattice of the ZSM-5 zeolite detected by XRD data.47 By analogy with ref. 48, special restrictions were imposed on the procedure of optimization of the positions of the boundary H* atoms. At first the structure of the initial zeolite cluster was constrained according to X-ray diffraction data.47 Then only SiH* and AlH* bond lengths and position of the copper ion were optimized, whereas positions of other atoms as well as directions of these bonds were fixed according to crystallo- graphic data while the Cu1 ion was allowed to move in the structure freely. The positions of H* atoms in all subsequent calculations were then fixed, while the positions of the remain- ing atoms of the cluster were optimized.
ZPE-corrected C2H6 adsorption energies were calculated with eqn. (1) while correction for BSSE was not performed due to the very significant changes of the optimized cluster geometry after ethane adsorption.
Eads  [E(C2H6/Cu1Z)  E(Cu1Z)  E(C2H6)] (1) To investigate the orbital distribution of electrons and energies of donoracceptor interactions in the ethane adsorption com- plexes with Cu1 ions, the population analysis was performed using the natural bond orbital method that has been imple- mented in the GAUSSIAN-98 program package. According to ref. 49 this method allows a rather reasonable description of different types of interatomic interactions and determination of their types, as well as of the orbital populations and orbital energies.
Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows DRIFT spectra of ethane adsorbed by Cu(I) at relatively high equilibrium pressures. They contain the follow- ing DRIFT bands: the strong narrow bands at 2974, 2941,2920 and 2882 cm1; the very weak band at 2738 cm1; and two weak broad bands with the maxima at 2642 and 2584 cm1. The former four bands are similar to those previously observed by us in the case of ethane adsorption by the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 zeolite or of the weak physical adsorption by ZnZSM-5.28 Therefore, by analogy with that Fig. 1 Cluster model of Cu1 stabilized at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite (Cu1Z). 1940 P h y s .

View Article Online work we ascribe these bands to the weakly perturbed C2H6 molecules inside the zeolite channels.
One can also see from comparison of the spectra in Fig. 2(a) and (b) that upon lowering of ethane pressure, the intensities of the bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1 changed very slightly. At the same time, the high frequency bands from the weakly per- turbed ethane very strongly decreased and, instead, several slightly shifted new narrow bands with the maxima at 2989,2949 and 2892 cm1 become apparent. Thus, the overall DRIFT spectra in Fig. 2(a) and (b) correspond to superposi- tion of at least two different forms of ethane adsorption. The simultaneous decreasing in intensities of the bands at 2989,2949 and 2892 cm1 with those of the low frequency bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1 shows that all of them belong to the same form of ethane adsorption by the univalent copper cations.
This form predominates at low pressure and, most likely, the dotted line in Fig. 2(b) represents the DRIFT spectra of CH stretching vibrations of ethane specifically adsorbed by Cu1 cations.
The appearance of the very strongly red shifted bands in the concerned spectra is the most striking. Recently we also observed the similar very strong bathochromic shift by more than 220 cm1 for n1 CH stretching vibrations in DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorbed by the zinc-modified ZSM-5 zeolite.28 However, in that case adsorption of C2H6 molecules by the low-coordinated Zn21 cations resulted in enormously high intensity of this band in comparison with the other bands from the CH stretching vibrations. It was suggested, that this effect resulted from the selective polarization of the corres- ponding CH vibrational mode that, in turn, led to heterolytic dissociation of adsorbed ethane molecules at elevated tempera- tures.
In contrast, as one can see from Fig. 2(b), we did not observe the similar effect for ethane adsorption by Cu(I)ZSM-5 zeo- lite. Indeed, despite the value of the low-frequency shift of the mostly perturbed CH stretching bands at 2582 and 2639 cm1 in this case is even higher than for ethane adsorption by the zinc-modified ZSM-5, their intensities are comparable with the weakly perturbed bands at 2892, 2949 and 2989 cm1. In addition, the heating of the copper modified sample in ethane atmosphere at elevated temperature up to 673 K did not result in dissociative adsorption. Instead such treatment resulted in the strong darkening of the sample that testified reduction of Cu1 cations into copper metal, which made the further DRIFT study of the zeolite impossible.
These results and the lower polarizing ability of Cu1 cations as against Zn21 cations with the only partially compensated positive charge26 indicate that the unusually strong perturba- tion of ethane by interaction with univalent copper cations has different nature than that suggested for ZnZSM-5 zeolite.
Therefore, it is not connected with the polarization of adsorbed C2H6 molecules, but should be explained by some different reasons.
As was already mentioned above, adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced CuZSM-5 zeolites results in formation of a rather strong s-type [Cu1(Z2-H2)]Z complexes. (By an Zn structure, we mean that n is the number of hydrogen atoms bonded to the cation). It was also concluded in ref. 23 that the binding in these complexes of hydrogen results from a combi- nation of the ligand-to-metal electron donation from H2 s- orbital to the vacant Cu1 s-orbital combined with the metal-to- ligand back donation from the copper dp-orbital to the H2 s*-orbital. Both of these interactions lead to a very marked weakening of the HH bond and, therefore, explain a very strong red shift of the corresponding vibration.
In the similar way we can suggest that unusually strong perturbation of ethane adsorbed by Cu1 cations could be also explained with formation of the similar s-complexes of Cu1 ions with adsorbed C2H6. In this case the value of the red shift of the CH stretching frequency is, however, much less than that one for hydrogen adsorption. This difference may be connected with the lower basicity of the CH s-bond due to the higher electronegativity of C in comparison with H atom and also in the steric hindrances for the back-donation from the carbon lobe of the CH s* complex resulting from the side- on binding that is possible for H2 but is more difficult for C2H6.
In this connection, it is possible to propose two following Z1 and Z2 alternative structures for ethane adsorption by Cu1 ions: (Fig. 3). The Z3 structure is not considered since due to only partial removal of degeneration of CH stretching vibra- tions for the C3v geometry, the DRIFT spectrum should contain in a contradiction with the experiment only four IR bands. In contrast, formation of both Z1 and Z2 complexes should result in the stronger lowering of the symmetry of adsorbed ethane from D3d to Cs. One can also suggest that for the Z1 structure the electron donation from s CH orbital to the partially occupied copper s-orbital should be less effective due to much lower overlap of the corresponding orbitals. Therefore, the Z2 structure may be favoured.
These hypotheses were tested by the DFT modeling of C2H6 adsorption by the Cu1Z cluster that is shown in Fig. 1. The optimized CuO bond lengths are summarized in Table 1. As could be expected, the copper cation is localized more closely to the Al atom. Therefore, despite the effective coordination number of Cu1 by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the bond lengths with the two oxygen atoms adjacent to aluminum are somewhat shorter than the third one. These results reason- ably well agree with those previously reported by Nachtigallo- va et al. in ref. 46 for Cu1 stabilized at the cationic site with the similar geometry as for the cluster used in the present work.
Adsorption of C2H6 can take place at the Cu1Z site both in Z1 and Z2 geometries. As proof of the above discussion, Z3 adsorption is not realized, as geometry optimization evolved to the formation of [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complex.

View Article Online complexes are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively, while Table 2 documents the C2H6 adsorption energies, the calculated frequencies of CH stretching vibrations and interatomic dis- tances of the CuC2H6 moiety. The obtained values of the adsorption energies for the Z1 and Z2 structures are equal to
15.04 and 22.75 kcal mol1, respectively. These values are quite
reasonable for the s-alkanetransition metal complexes recently discussed in literature.29,30,38 One can also emphasize that for- mation of the Z2 adsorption complex leads to the very significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption site: the Cu1 ion partially leaves the cationic site while its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. On the other hand,formation of the Z1-complex results in only slight increase of the CuO bond lengths (Table 1).
The computed adsorption energy for the Z2 structure is by about 8 kcal mol1 higher than for the Z1 complex. Interaction of two CH bonds with the Cu1 cation also leads to the much stronger changes in geometry of the corresponding methyl group and, therefore, results in very strong low-frequency shifts of the corresponding CH stretching vibrations. The larger shift corresponds to symmetric CH vibrations, while the lower shift to the asymmetric one. For both adsorption complexes the CH bonds involved in the bonding with the Cu1 ions are considerably longer in comparison with the same values calculated for the free C2H6 molecule, while the rest of CH bonds of adsorbed ethane are perturbed insignificantly.
These results of theoretical calculations are in a reasonably good agreement with the above discussed experimental data.
Indeed, as follows from Table 2, the calculated CH stretching frequencies for [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes are close to those experimentally observed in the obtained DRIFT spectra. This confirms that the dotted line in Fig. 2(b) corres- ponds to the spectrum of ethane adsorption complexes with the Z2 geometry. The very weak band at 2734 cm1 could be then ascribed to the Z1 adsorption complexes, with the lower adsorption energy.
One can see that both the experimental results and theore- tical calculations show that adsorption of ethane by Cu(I)- ZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of two CH stretching vibrations of adsorbed molecules. However, unlike ethane adsorption by ZnZSM-5, the heating of the copper modified sample in the ethane atmosphere at the temperatures up to 673 K does not result in heterolytic dissociative Table 1 Calculated CuO bond lengths/A in the Cu1Z cluster model both in presence and in absence of adsorbed ethane Cu1Z Z1-C2H6/Cu1Z Z2-C2H6/Cu1Z CuO1

View Article Online adsorption. This fact is quite surprising, since the red shifts of the CH stretching bands are much higher than for C2H6 adsorption by ZnZSM-5, which is involved in heterolytic dissociation at the moderately high temperatures.
To clarify the nature of the unusually strong perturbation of ethane by isolated Cu1 ions at a-sites, we also performed the NBO analysis for the [Cu1(Zn-C2H6)]Z (n  1,2) adsorption complexes. The obtained orbital populations and energies of the donoracceptor interactions between C2H6 and Cu1 are summarized in Table 3.
One can see that for the Z1 adsorption mode the overlap of the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with CH s orbital of ethane is very strongly influenced by the steric factors. Therefore, the ligand-to-metal donation is very weak (Edon  4.5 kcal mol1) and the strongest interaction in this case is the metal-to-ligand back donation from copper ds and s orbitals to the s* CH orbital (Eback  16.5 kcal) (Fig. 4(a)). On the other hand, for [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes both types of the ligandmetal interactions are much stronger (Eback  18.5 kcal mol1 and Edon  32.5 kcal mol1) and the ethane bonding with Cu1 could be reasonably described in the same way as for [Cu1(Z2-H2)]Z complexes, i.e. by a synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH s orbitals to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-ligand back-donation from copper dp-orbitals to the CH s* orbitals (Fig. 4(b)). Obviously, each component of such interaction with univalent copper for both Z1- and Z2-C2H6 complexes results in a very strong weakening of the CH bonds contacting the copper ion. However, only formation of the Z2 adsorption complex results in an unusually strong red shift of the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, since both the dona- tion and the back-donation in this case are much more effective.
On the other hand, the absence of heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane at elevated temperatures could be ex- plained in the following way. Indeed, the interaction of C2H6 with Cu1 resulting in a very strong weakening of the CH bonds due to electron donation to the univalent copper.
Usually such interactions lead to full oxidative addition of the hydrocarbon to the transition metal.31 However, for copper this process seems to be improbable, since formation of the species containing trivalent copper is very exotic. On the other hand, the studied C2H6/Cu(I)-ZSM-5 system does not contain any nucleophilic reagent or surface species, which are able to react with the activated CH bonds. These conclusions should be, however, verified by our future investigations.
Due to the very low stability, transition metal complexes with light alkanes have been earlier reported only for very specific conditions such as matrix isolation, laser flash photo- lysis or as an intermediates in the reactions of oxidative addition or reductive elimination. The present study shows that the zeolite matrix can play a role of the stabilizing agent in formation of the s-ethane complexes with Cu1. It could be considered as the first direct DRIFTS study of s-type donor acceptor alkane transition metal complexes.
Conclusion Ethane is adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 at room temperature in at least two different forms. The first of them does not exhibit any significant perturbation of adsorbed molecules. DRIFT spec- trum of C2H6 adsorbed in this way is similar to that one for ethane adsorption by HZSM-5.
The second form of molecular ethane adsorption occurs on the isolated Cu1 ions stabilized in the ZSM-5 lattice at a-sites.
This form is much stronger, but is still reversible at room temperature. The most exciting feature of this form of adsorp- tion is a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules due to interaction with Cu1 cations that is evident from appearance in the DRIFT spectra of the very strongly red shifted CH stretching bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1. Such low-frequency shifts of about 300 cm1 have never been observed before either for ethane adsorbed by oxides or by any cationic form of zeolite. It is concluded that such unusual properties of ad- sorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type donoracceptor adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations. However, such a strong perturbation does not result in subsequent dissociation of ethane at higher temperatures.
DFT modeling of C2H6 adsorption by the isolated Cu1 cations stabilized at the a-site of the ZSM-5 zeolite has shown that the most preferential geometry of adsorption complexes corresponds to interaction with copper of two protons from the Table 3 Energies/kcal mol1 of donoracceptor interactions between C2H6 and Cu1Z, and NBO population analysis (electrons) for C2H6, Cu1Z, Z1-C2H6/Cu1Z and Z2-C2H6/Cu1Z clusters Isolated C2H6 and Cu1Z

The bonding in such [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complexes could be rationalized by a synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH s-orbitals to the partially-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-li- gand back-donation from the copper dp-orbitals to CH s* orbitals. In contrast to the previously reported very unstable transition metal complexes of light alkanes or to the complexes of the alkanes with the naked transition metal cations, the obtained s-type ethane-Cu1 adsorption complexes display a rather high stability that allows their DRIFT investigation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
