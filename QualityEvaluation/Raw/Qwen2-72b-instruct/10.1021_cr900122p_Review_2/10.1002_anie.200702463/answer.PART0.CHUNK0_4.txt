[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
[2] "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
[3] "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
[4] "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
[5] "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
[6] "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."
[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
[8] "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
[9] "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
[10] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如MFI沸石中的镓、锌和铂,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。这些催化剂对轻烷烃芳构化和甲烷转化为汽油产品等过程至关重要。催化团簇的性质,无论是孤立的阳离子还是涉及框架外氧原子,在烷烃活化中起着关键作用。ZSM-5中Ga+物种通过一氧化二氮氧化形成更活性的gallyl (GaO+)离子。添加蒸汽稳定了GaO+离子,增强了Ga/ZSM-5相对于HZSM-5的脱氢活性。水促进了反应性部分水解的镓物种的形成,降低了氢重组的能量。Ga3+离子周围稳定的四面体构型促进了氢的解吸。在Ga2O2二聚体上烷烃脱氢涉及由Ga3+和框架外碱性氧原子形成的路易斯酸对的异裂解离,随后是烯烃解吸和氢重组。
