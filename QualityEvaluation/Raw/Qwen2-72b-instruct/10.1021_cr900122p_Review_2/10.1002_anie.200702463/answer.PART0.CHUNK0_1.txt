[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
[2] "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
[3] "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
[4] "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
[5] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[6] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters in zeolites can profoundly affect hydrocarbon catalytic reactions. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species like gallium, zinc, and platinum are the foundation for light alkane aromatization processes. The incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5 is another example. The activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 can be increased by oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide, leading to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer involves initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination. Continuous water addition is necessary to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。沸石中的超框架过渡金属阳离子簇可以深刻影响碳氢化合物的催化反应。含有脱氢物种如镓、锌和铂的MFI沸石是轻烷烃芳构化过程的基础。另一个吸引人的例子是MTG过程中Ga/HZSM-5上甲烷向汽油产品的转化。ZSM-5中Ga+物种的活性在473K下通过一氧化二氮氧化而增加，归因于gallyl (GaO+)离子的形成。桥接羟基键的酸度增加和Ga3+离子周围稳定的四面体构型促进了H2的解吸。Ga2O2二聚体上烷烃的脱氢通过Ga3+和基本超框架氧原子形成的Lewis酸对的初始异裂解离开始，随后是烯烃解吸和氢重组。需要连续添加水以保持高浓度的羟基化反应中间体的稳态浓度。这些因素对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性有贡献。
