[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
[2] "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
[3] "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
[4] "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
[5] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[6] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The activity of Ga+ species can be enhanced by oxidation, leading to the formation of more reactive gallyl ions. The acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption, which is essential for the dehydrogenation of alkanes over the Ga2O2 dimer. Continuous water addition maintains a high concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, which is necessary for the catalytic cycle.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如MFI沸石中的镓、锌和铂，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。这些催化剂对轻烷烃芳构化和将甲烷纳入汽油产品等过程至关重要。Ga+物种的活性可以通过氧化增强，形成更反应性的gallyl离子。桥接羟基键的酸性和Ga3+离子周围稳定的四面体构型促进了H2的解吸，这对Ga2O2二聚体上的烷烃脱氢至关重要。持续加水维持了羟基化反应中间体的高浓度，这是催化循环所必需的。
