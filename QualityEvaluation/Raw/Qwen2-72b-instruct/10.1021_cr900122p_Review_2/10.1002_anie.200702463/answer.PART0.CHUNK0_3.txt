[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
[2] "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
[3] "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
[4] "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
[5] "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
[6] "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."
[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
[8] "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
[9] "These theoretical insights imply that H2 desorption should be facile from hydroxylated Ga clusters in ZSM-5."
[10] "The higher activity of dimeric oxygen-bridged Gaspecies compared to single-site Ga+ species is in line with the lower energy for H2 recombination."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species like gallium, zinc, and platinum are foundational in light alkane aromatization processes. The incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5 is another example. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether alkanes are activated by isolated cations or extraframework oxygen atoms play a role, is a catalytic issue. The activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 can be increased upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide, forming gallyl (GaO+) ions. GaO+ can be stabilized by the addition of steam. The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is evident from the increased amount of hydrogen formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation significantly decreases the reaction energy for H2 recombination. Theoretical insights suggest that H2 desorption should be facile from hydroxylated Ga clusters in ZSM-5. The higher activity of dimeric oxygen-bridged Gaspecies compared to single-site Ga+ species aligns with the lower energy for H2 recombination. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。含有脱氢物种如镓、锌和铂的MFI沸石是轻烷烃芳构化过程的基础。Ga/HZSM-5在MTG过程中将甲烷并入汽油产品是另一个吸引人的例子。催化问题与阳离子簇的性质有关：烷烃是由孤立的阳离子激活的，还是额外框架氧原子也起作用？ZSM-5中Ga+物种的活性在473K下被一氧化二氮氧化后增加，归因于形成gallyl (GaO+)离子。根据反应方案，GaO+可以通过添加蒸汽来稳定。与HZSM-5相比，Ga/ZSM-5的脱氢活性增加，从形成的氢气量增加中显而易见。水的促进作用是由于形成了反应性的部分水解的镓物种。[Ga(H)(OH)]+离子的羟基与相邻的镓阳离子的配位导致H2重组的反应能量显著降低。理论见解表明，从ZSM-5中的羟基化镓簇中脱附H2应该是容易的。与单点Ga+物种相比，二聚氧桥接Gaspecies的较高活性与H2重组的较低能量一致。这些因素对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业意义有贡献。
