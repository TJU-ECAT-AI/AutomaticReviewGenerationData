[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
[2] "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
[3] "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
[4] "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
[5] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[6] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The activity of gallium species in ZSM-5 can be enhanced by oxidation, leading to the formation of gallyl ions. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate hydrogen desorption, which is essential for the dehydrogenation of alkanes over the Ga2O2 dimer. Continuous water addition is necessary to maintain a high concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, which is critical for the catalytic cycle.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如MFI沸石中的镓、锌和铂，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。这些催化剂对于轻烷烃芳构化和将甲烷并入汽油产品等过程至关重要。ZSM-5中镓物种的活性可以通过氧化增强，形成gallyl离子。桥接羟基键的酸性增加和Ga3+离子周围的稳定四面体构型促进了氢解吸，这对于Ga2O2二聚体上烷烃的脱氢至关重要。持续添加水对于维持高浓度的羟基化反应中间体是必要的，这是催化循环的关键。

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。沸石中的超框架过渡金属阳离子簇可以深刻影响碳氢化合物的催化反应。含有脱氢物种如镓、锌和铂的MFI沸石是轻烷烃芳构化过程的基础。另一个吸引人的例子是MTG过程中Ga/HZSM-5上甲烷向汽油产品的转化。ZSM-5中Ga+物种的活性在473K下通过一氧化二氮氧化而增加，归因于gallyl (GaO+)离子的形成。桥接羟基键的酸度增加和Ga3+离子周围稳定的四面体构型促进了H2的解吸。Ga2O2二聚体上烷烃的脱氢通过Ga3+和基本超框架氧原子形成的Lewis酸对的初始异裂解离开始，随后是烯烃解吸和氢重组。需要连续添加水以保持高浓度的羟基化反应中间体的稳态浓度。这些因素对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性有贡献。

MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species like gallium, zinc, and platinum are foundational in light alkane aromatization processes. The incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5 is another example. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether alkanes are activated by isolated cations or extraframework oxygen atoms play a role, is a catalytic issue. The activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 can be increased upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide, forming gallyl (GaO+) ions. GaO+ can be stabilized by the addition of steam. The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is evident from the increased amount of hydrogen formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation significantly decreases the reaction energy for H2 recombination. Theoretical insights suggest that H2 desorption should be facile from hydroxylated Ga clusters in ZSM-5. The higher activity of dimeric oxygen-bridged Gaspecies compared to single-site Ga+ species aligns with the lower energy for H2 recombination.

These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.
