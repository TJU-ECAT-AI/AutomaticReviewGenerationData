1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Zn21 and Ga11 cations in ZSM-5 zeolite, influence the mechanisms of alkane transformations. Zinc-modified HZSM-5 activates ethane through acidbase pairs at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociation at moderate temperatures. In contrast, gallium-modified HZSM-5 weakly adsorbs ethane, with dissociative adsorption occurring at high temperatures to form ethyl and hydride fragments. The presence of Brnsted acid protons in zinc-modified HZSM-5 facilitates aromatization, while gallium-modified HZSM-5 does not generate these protons, resulting in selective ethane conversion to ethylene. These differences in activation mechanisms have direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two distinct mechanisms of ethane activation were observed over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn2+ and Ga+ cations. Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn2+-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons. In contrast, ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga+ ions at elevated temperatures. This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene. On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity. These differences in alkane activation have direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如锌和镓改性的HZSM-5沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。在Zn2+和Ga+离子改性的ZSM-5沸石上观察到两种不同的乙烷活化机制。乙烷在室温下强烈吸附在Zn/ZSM-5上,导致烃类的强极化。加热时,该复合物在Lewis酸Zn2+-基本氧对上容易解离,再生Brnsted酸质子。相比之下,乙烷在还原的Ga/ZSM-5上吸附较弱,烃类活化被提议在较高温度下通过一价Ga+离子的氧化加成发生。这导致乙基和氢化物片段嫁接到镓上,在进一步加热下分解成乙烯和镓二氢化物。在Ga/ZSM-5上烃类活化时,Brnsted酸质子的形成缺失,导致乙烷稳定和选择性地转化为乙烯。另一方面,Zn/ZSM-5显示出较高的初始活性,但由于Brnsted酸性的生成而遭受焦化失活和二次芳构化反应。这些烷烃活化差异对涉及脱氢的烃类转化有直接影响,影响反应的效率和选择性。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够选择性地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品,如乙烯,通过脱氢过程。
