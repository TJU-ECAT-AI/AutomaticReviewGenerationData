1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Zn21 and Ga11 cations in ZSM-5 zeolite, influence the mechanisms of alkane transformations. Zinc-modified HZSM-5 activates ethane through acidbase pairs at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociation at moderate temperatures. In contrast, gallium-modified HZSM-5 weakly adsorbs ethane, with dissociative adsorption occurring at high temperatures to form ethyl and hydride fragments. The presence of Brnsted acid protons in zinc-modified HZSM-5 facilitates aromatization, while gallium-modified HZSM-5 does not generate these protons, resulting in selective ethane conversion to ethylene. These differences in activation mechanisms have direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如ZSM-5沸石中的Zn21和Ga11阳离子,影响烷烃转化的机制。锌改性的HZSM-5通过室温下的酸碱对活化乙烷,在中等温度下导致异裂解吸。相比之下,镓改性的HZSM-5弱吸附乙烷,在高温下发生解离吸附,形成乙基和氢化物片段。锌改性的HZSM-5中存在布隆斯特酸质子促进了芳构化,而镓改性的HZSM-5不生成这些质子,导致乙烷选择性转化为乙烯。这些活化机制的差异对涉及脱氢的烃转化有直接影响,影响反应的效率和选择性。
