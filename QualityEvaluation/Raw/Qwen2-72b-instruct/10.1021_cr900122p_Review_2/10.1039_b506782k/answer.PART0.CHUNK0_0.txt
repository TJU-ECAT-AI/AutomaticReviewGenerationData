1.The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, affecting the industrial significance of these catalysts.

1.烷烃转化机制和效率,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中,受到基于金属的催化剂(包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石)的组成和结构的影响。通过扩散反射红外光谱学研究锌和镓改性的HZSM-5脱氢催化剂上的乙烷活化,揭示了两种截然不同的机制。由远距离分离的阳离子Zn21和基本氧位点形成的酸碱对对乙烷的较强分子吸附导致吸附乙烷的强极化,并在中温下发生异裂解吸附。相比之下,乙烷在Ga1阳离子上的分子吸附较弱,在高温下,发生解离性烃吸附,导致乙基和氢化物片段与镓阳离子物种的配位。在锌的情况下,乙烷解离时形成Brnsted酸质子,而在镓的情况下,乙基片段在镓上分解形成镓二氢化物物种,不会形成Brnsted酸质子。这种烷烃活化机制的差异对涉及脱氢的烃转化有直接影响,影响这些催化剂的工业意义。
