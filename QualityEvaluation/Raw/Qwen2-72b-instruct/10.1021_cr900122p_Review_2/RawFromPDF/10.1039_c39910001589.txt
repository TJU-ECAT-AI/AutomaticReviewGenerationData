The silica-grafted zirconium hydride complex, synthesized by hydrogenolysis of the well-defined $ SiOZrNp3, 
activates the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane as shown by the formation of the corresponding cyclooctyl-

plexes. 
A great deal of interest is shown today in the activation of 
methane and higher alkanes. A number of complexes of 
transition metals of group 111-V, lanthanides and actinides 
have recently been reported to activate the C-H bond of 
alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
1 A common feature of 
these complexes is that the metal is in its highest oxidation 
state; it therefore, has a do electron configuration and is 
consequently highly electrophilic. The first example of an 
intermolecular alkane activation reaction is the methyl 
exchange with methane in a lutetium complex, Scheme 1.2 
We report here that a zirconium hydride complex, grafted 
onto the surface of silica, acquires such high electrophilic 
properties, that the reaction of o-bond metathesis between the 
Zr hydride and the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane 
becomes feasible.

Reaction of tetraneopentylzirconium, ZrNp4, with the 
surface of a silica, previously dehydroxylated at 773 K, leads 
to a well-defined3 surface complex,-

A supported zirconium hydride surface complex, 2, is formed 
by treatment of 1 with hydrogen [p(H2) 6 x lO4Pa; T423 K]. 2 
has been identified by IR spectroscopy [Fig. l(a)], chemical 
reactivity and deuterium exchange experiments.4 All 
subsequent studies on 2 have been carried out under strict 
exclusion of 0 2  
and H20. (The absence of Zr-OH is checked 
by IR spectroscopy.) 
This supported zirconium hydride, 2, [Zr],-H, reacts with 
cyclooctane at room temperature to form a Zr-cyclooctyl 
surface complex, eqn. (2). Support for reaction (2) is given by 
[Zr],-H + cyclooctane + 
[Zr],-cyclooctyl + H2 
(2) 
the following experimental evidence: (i) After gas-phase 
evacuation, the IR spectrum of the solid is modified: two 
bands, characteristic of v(CH2) 
vibrational modes at 2927 and 
2857 cm-1, and two bands, typical of 6(CH2) vibrational 
modes at 1462 and 1447 cm-1 appear. Simultaneously, the 
intensity of the v(Zr-H) band at 1635 cm-1 decreases strongly 
[Fig. 1(6)]. (ii) Gas-phase chromatography shows that the 
reaction between 2 and cyclooctane leads to the formation of 
molecular hydrogen in the gas phase. (iii) Treatment of the 
[Zr],-cyclooctyl, assumed to be formed, with hydrogen Lp(H2) 
5.33 Pa; T 343 K] regenerates the zirconium-hydride surface 
complex 1 [Fig. l(c)]; cyclooctane as well as its hydrogenolysis 
products are detected in the gas phase. (iv) 
The appearance of 
a v(C0) band at 1652 cm-1, ascribed to an acyl ligand,5 
suggests that molecular CO is inserted into the Zr-C bond. 
Subsequent extraction of the organic ligands with HC1 reveals 
the formation of cyclooctanal as the major component, eqn. 
(3). Surprisingly, this supported [Zr],-H 2 under moderate 
conditions [p(CH4) 5.3 x 104 Pa; T 423 K] is also reactive 
towards methane, eqn. (4).

Evidence for reaction (4) comes from the following data: (i) 
Upon introduction of CH4 
on 2 at 423 K, the intensity of the 
v(Zr-H) band decreases. (ii) Molecular hydrogen is formed 
during this interaction. (iii) Analysis by mass spectrometry 
shows that subsequent hydrolysis with D 2 0  
(2.7 x lo3 Pa) 
liberates exclusively CH3D, eqn. (5). (iv) The formation of 
[Zr],-13CH3 on reaction of 2 with 13CH4 
is confirmed by 13C 
MAS NMR spectroscopy by the observation of a broad band

To our knowledge, no reaction of intermolecular alkane 
activation has previously been reported either on a molecular- 
or on a grafted-zirconium complex. The silica surface 
enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium centre, allowing

the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes. This increase in the 
electrophilic character of the metal is probably related to the 
stabilization of an 8e-Zr by the surface siloxy ligands, while 
molecular analogues are usually stabilized by two cyclo- 
pentadienyl ligands and thus have a 16e-configuration.
