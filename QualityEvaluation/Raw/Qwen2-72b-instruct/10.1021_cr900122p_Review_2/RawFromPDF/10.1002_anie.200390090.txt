Catalysis research builds bridges between disciplines. The cover picture shows the
linking position of surface organometallic chemistry between the two traditional areas of
catalysis. The transfer of the concepts and tools of molecular organometallic chemistry
to surfaces leads to the generation of well-defined surface species. The success of this
approach results from understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the
support. More about this field can be found in the review by Copÿret, Basset, et al. on
page 156ff.
