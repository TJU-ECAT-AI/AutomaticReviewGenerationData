Abstract 
The use of transient kinetics is reviewed for recent works performed in the wide area of 
methane valorization. The specific contribution of techniques such as steady-state isotopic 
transient kinetics, fast temperature transients, TAP reactor studies is illustrated for reactions 
involving different modes of methane activation and various types of catalysts. 
Keywords: Transient kinetics; Methane activation (catalytic-) 
1. Introduction 
During the last decades, there was a world-wide interest in the conversion 
into value-added products of methane, as the main constituent of natural gas. 
This stimulated a wide range of research activities aimed both at fundamental 
and applied aspects of methane chemistry. Several novel routes for direct 
conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates were proposed 
and investigated, in parallel with a renewed interest for classical indirect routes 
through syngas formation. 
As far as direct conversion is concerned, such as the oxidative coupling into 
C 2 hydrocarbons, strong limitations of the yield of the envisaged products 
seemed at that time to impede any possibility of process development on an 
industrial scale. In contrast, indirect conversion via syngas does not suffer from 
yield limitations since very high conversion and selectivity can easily be 
achieved. However, a well established industrial process such as steam reform- 
ing is facing now severe environmental requirements, related to the heat

production required by the reaction endothermicity. This led recently to an 
extensive research effort on a less heat-consuming process such as partial 
oxidation. For this case, engineering problems such as heat and mass transfer 
control and catalyst stability have still to be solved. 
Most of the above difficulties simply derive from two basic features of the 
methane molecule: its symmetry and stability. The symmetry renders it ex- 
tremely difficult to control the number of C-H bonds to be activated in a 
catalytic system designed for a selective conversion into desired products. The 
stability of the methane molecule requires severe operating conditions under 
which the products of conversion are far more reactive than methane itself. 
Thus, secondary reactions occur which decompose part of the desired products 
into waste, such as CO 
x in direct oxidative conversions, or coke in non-oxida- 
tive homologation. 
In view of improving the catalytic systems already known for methane 
catalytic conversion, and/or obtaining reliable kinetic schemes for engineering 
modelling studies, reactor development and optimization, a precise knowledge 
of the related mechanisms is obviously required. The transient kinetic analysis, 
using unlabelled or labelled molecules, has already proved to be a powerful and 
unique technique to investigate the way that gas molecules may react with an 
active surface. As a matter of fact, it allows to evaluate the residence time and 
the surface accumulation of the activated intermediates and may also provide 
information on the possible competition in adsorption/desorption steps with 
co-reacting molecules [1]. Moreover, it perfectly applies under the often severe 
temperature conditions required for methane activation, while numerous 
physico-chemical techniques used for catalyst characterization do not. Note, 
however, that recent progress in designing high temperature Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) catalytic cells permits now to combine gas and surface in situ 
transient kinetic investigations up to around 900°C. 
The transient kinetic analysis is based on the principle (i) of perturbing a 
steady-state established on a working catalyst by changing abruptly one or more 
of the state variables such as feed concentration, molar flow rate, pressure or 
temperature, and (ii) of following the relaxation of the system. The perturbation 
should be imposed on a time scale smaller than the time that allows the 
sequence of elementary steps which control the reaction kinetics to reach again 
the steady-state. Until now, most of the non-steady-state experiments based on 
concentration step functions or temperature changes showed a time resolution 
around one second. Recently a new transient technique derived from molecular 
beam scattering experiments was developed by Gleaves et al. [2]. The temporal 
analysis of products (TAP) reactor, which consists in pulsing very small 
amounts of reacting species over a catalyst maintained under low pressure, 
operates in the millisecond regime. Within the frame of methane activation, 
numerous transient experiments have been reported, indeed, with a time resolu- 
tion adapted to the kind of investigated elementary steps. This paper aims at

illustrating the use of transient kinetic techniques for elucidating the most 
promising routes for methane valorisation through some specific studies carried 
out in our laboratory. 
A simple classification of the ways to activate methane is to consider both the 
mode of involved C-H bond activation --homolytic or heterolytic-- and the 
type of solids --metal or oxide-- which are concerned. Thus, we will first 
consider the methane activation occurring on metal surfaces via a homolytic 
splitting, leading to various CH x and H fragments which may recombine on the 
surface either into methane (reversible activation) or into higher hydrocarbons in 
the absence of oxygen, as for the non-oxidative homologation, or into CO and 
H 2 in the presence of oxidising species, as for the dry reforming by CO 2. 
Second, the activation on basic oxides involving either a heterolytic splitting 
into CH 3 and H ÷, or a homolytic splitting leading directly to methyl radicals 
CH 
3 • will be illustrated by experiments designed for investigating the oxidative 
coupling of methane. Finally, some recent results obtained for the activation of 
methane into aromatics on acidic solids which may involve the heterolytic 
activation into CH~- and H- will be presented. 
2. Methane activation on metals 
2.1. Methane reforming by carbon dioxide into syngas 
The mechanism of the carbon dioxide reforming of methane was investigated 
over a model nickel-on-silica catalyst, which was shown to be reasonably stable 
under reaction conditions. Typically, the reaction was carried out at 700°C and 
at atmospheric pressure with a reaction mixture CH4/COa/He = 7.5/7.5/85. 
Non-steady-state and steady-state isotopic transient experiments combined with 
in situ DRIFT spectroscopy investigations and magnetic measurements were 
used to quantify the amount of the various adspecies present on the working 
catalyst surface [3-5]. 
2.1.1. Non-steady-state transient experiments 
A first initial transient experiment consisted of following the methane, carbon 
dioxide and carbon monoxide responses during the reaction start-up, i.e., by 
switching at the reactor inlet from a flow of helium to the reaction mixture at 
700°C over the reduced catalyst (Fig. 1). The shift between the argon response 
(added as an inert tracer representing the non-catalytic system response) and the 
methane and carbon dioxide led to a non-equilibrated carbon balance (after 
deduction of the produced CO), indicating carbon deposition in the very first 
period of the reaction. This carbon uptake corresponded to a C/Ni s ratio of 2.4, 
where Ni s represents surface metal atoms, as determined by magnetic measure- 
ments and electron microscopy [3]. A temperature programmed hydrogenation

(TPH) experiment carried out after 10 min on stream revealed that part of these 
initial carbon deposits were easily hydrogenated into methane at 230°C, leading 
to a C/Ni s ratio of 0.36. This highly reactive carbon was shown further on to 
exist in similar amounts whatever the time on reforming stream. Less easily 
hydrogenated carbons were also shown to accumulate on the catalyst, but at 
increasing amounts with time on stream (a C/Ni s ratio of 23.2 was found after 
67 h of reaction). The latter form of stable carbon was unambiguously ascribed, 
on the basis of TEM studies, to carbonaceous filaments or whiskers participating 
in the slow catalyst deactivation [3]. 
Let us now focus on the most reactive carbon species. Using magnetic 
measurements, the percentage of ferromagnetic nickel was found to correspond 
to 100% of metallic nickel after the initial reduction. As soon as contacted with 
the reaction mixture, the ferromagnetism decreased to 80-90%. After a specific 
hydrogenation of the most reactive carbon species (TPH up to 300°C), the initial 
ferromagnetism was restored. This clearly demonstrated that these carbon 
species were in strong chemical interaction with the metallic nickel phase, 
forming a new non-ferromagnetic phase. XPS studies carried out after 10 min on 
stream also revealed the development of a surface nickel carbide phase (known 
to be non-ferromagnetic) [5]. Thus, it could be concluded that under the reaction 
conditions, a carbide-like phase developed on the surface of the metallic Ni 
particles. 
A second type of non-steady-state transient experiments consisted of switch- 
ing from the reaction mixture CHn/CO2/He/Ar to a mixture CO2/He. In this 
case, large amounts of CO were released from the surface under pure CO 2

atmosphere, showing that carbon dioxide could react directly with the carbon 
deposits into CO. The amount of produced CO corresponded to the reverse 
Boudouard reaction -- CO 2 + C ~ 2CO -- allowing the initial carbon de- 
posits to be oxidised by CO 2. 
In a third type of non-steady-state transient experiment the reaction mixture 
CH4/CO2/He/Ar was switched to a mixture CHa/He. A significant residual 
production of hydrogen, corresponding to the conversion of about half the molar 
volume of methane, was observed after this transient step (Fig. 2). This 
demonstrated that under fuel-rich conditions, methane was decomposed into two 
hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, the latter reacting with the nickel 
phase to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a marked decrease of the 
ferromagnetic signal. 
2.1.2. Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) 
By switching from the reaction mixture t2CH4/12COz/He to the labelled 
mixture 13CH4/~2CO2/He/Ar, 
the overall steady-state conditions were main- 
tained while a carbon tracing transient was generated (Fig. 3a and b). The

methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal (Fig. 
3b). At variance with methane, a significant delay was observed between the 
reference Ar curve and the CO 2 signal, indicating the presence on the surface of 
CO 2 precursors corresponding to a surface coverage of 10% (assuming a 
stoichiometry of one CO 2 precursor per surface Ni atom). The delay observed 
between the Ar signal and the produced J3CO could be estimated to be 0.48 s in 
Fig. 3b, which corresponded to a surface coverage of CO precursors, i.e., of 
reaction intermediates, of 43% (or C/Ni s = 0.43, assuming the same stoichiom- 
etry as above). 
The hydrogen tracing transient under steady-state conditions was generated 
by switching from a CH4/COz/He to a CD4/CO2/He/Ar mixture. This 
experiment revealed some H/D exchange from the observation of slight amounts 
of CH3D, CH2D 2 and CHD 3 during the transient period. In order to follow 
precisely the exchange pathway which is related to the reversible activation of 
methane, the reforming was studied by feeding the reactor with the mixture 
CH 4 -F CDa/CO2/Ar. Table 1 reports the isotopic composition of the non-re- 
acted methane and of the produced hydrogen at the reactor outlet and the 
calculated isotopic composition which would be obtained if the H and D atoms 
in the methane molecules were randomly distributed [1]: 
(i) a large H/D exchange was observed at 700°C. However, a clear shift of 
the isotopic distribution towards the heavier methanes was observed by compari- 
son with the statistical distribution. This indicated that the recombination of 
surface species into heavy methanes was much more likely than the recombina- 
tion into light methane, demonstrating a marked kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) for 
the methane reversible activation. 
(ii) The isotopic composition of hydrogen produced was very close to the 
statistical one, indicating a fast gas/surface exchange for hydrogen, without 
isotopic effect. 
(iii) The ratio of exchanged methane (i.e. the sum of the CH3D, CHzD 2, 
CHD 3 outlet partial pressures) to converted methane into CO was equal to 0.10. 
This value indicated that the probability for an activated methane to be

converted into CO was much higher than its probability to be recombined into 
gaseous methane. Thus, despite some fast H/D equilibration, the overall 
methane conversion could be considered as largely irreversible. 
(iv) Qualitative evidence of isotopic scrambling was also obtained for water. 
2.1.3. Temperature transient experiments 
In order to complete the information obtained on carbon deposits, a fast 
oxidation of these deposits was carried out after 10 min under 
13CH4/12CO2/He 
mixture (Fig. 4). Two types of carbonaceous deposits were revealed: one easily 
oxidised (at 500°C) corresponded to a ratio C/Ni~ of 0,53; a second one, more 
stable towards oxygen (oxidised between around 650°C), which was found to 
depend on time on stream. The easily oxidised carbon deposits were assigned to 
part of the reaction intermediates identified from SSITKA for two reasons: (i) 
both amounts were close (C/Ni s = 0.5) and (ii) their isotopic composition 
revealed that a large part of these deposits was formed of ~3C (76%). This 
perfectly agreed with the fact that a large part of the active adspecies were 
shown to be CO precursors, arising from the initial activation of methane 
(SSITKA experiments). The less easily oxidised carbon deposits corresponded 
to slowly accumulating species, progressively transformed into carbon whiskers. 
The last key information about the working surface was provided by in situ 
DRIFT spectroscopy. No adsorbed CO and OH vibrations were detected at 
700°C, indicating that neither Ni-CO nor Ni-OH adspecies formed significant 
pools on the reacting surface under reforming conditions. In contrast, evidence 
of adsorbed CO was found at lower temperature (500°C) at low methane

conversions. This strongly suggested that CO 2 could easily dissociate on Ni 
particles into adsorbed CO and most probably adsorbed O. The absence of 
adsorbed CO at 700°C would derive from a much lower residence time on the 
reacting surface, resulting in a negligible surface accumulation. 
2.1.4. Mechanistic scheme 
From the above description of the working surface mostly derived from 
transient kinetics, several mechanistic steps could be proposed, in relation to the 
surface occupancy: 
(i) The first step of methane activation consists of a reversible reaction 
between gas molecules and surface sites S 1, leading to adsorbed carbon and 
gaseous hydrogen according to 
CH 4 -b S 1 ~ 
Cad s q- 2H 2 
(1) 
It corresponds under steady-state conditions to the formation of a pool of 
around half a monolayer of atomic carbon, i.e. one monolayer of carbide-like 
active intermediate species assuming the carbide formula NizC or Ni3C. Within 
this step, the intermediate formation of hydrogenated species CH x and a fast 
gas/surface hydrogen equilibrium have to be considered in order to account for 
the observed H/D exchange reactions. However, no evidence of significant 
accumulation of CH x or Hads species was found. A marked KIE corresponded to 
this reversible part of the methane activation, as expected for a step involving 
several C-H bond breaking (onward) and formation (backward). To summarise, 
step (1) can be considered under the present conditions as a fast step, largely 
reversible at 700°C and leading solely to the accumulation of dehydrogenated 
carbon monomers. 
(ii) Carbon dioxide was also found in fast equilibrium with the reacting 
surface, and easily interconverting with carbon monoxide. Assuming that the 
reacting surface was essentially the carbide-like phase formed from step (1), this 
step could be written in a first approximation as an overall equilibrium, as 
assumed by Erdt~helyi et al. [6]: 
CO 2 -[- Cad s ~ 
2CO + S l 
(2) 
Actually, the in-situ characterisation of the working surface led us to propose 
that this equilibrium would most likely result from two elementary steps which 
would account for the CO formation: 
(a) The dissociative adsorption of CO 2 on a site S 2 leading to surface oxygen 
and CO. The former would constitute the adsorbed CO 2 precursors quantified 
by SSITKA (Fig. 3b) and corresponding to a surface coverage of about 10%. 
The latter would be immediately released into the gas phase, as indicated by the 
IR study:

surface oxygen atoms (arising from step 3) into CO immediately released into 
the gas phase:

(4) 
Though a competition between methane and carbon dioxide for adsorption on 
the same sites cannot be discarded, various recent experiments suggest that 
different sites (size and location) had to be considered for methane (S~) and 
carbon dioxide (S 2) activation [unpublished results]. 
Within these assumptions, step (3) has to be considered as highly reversible 
and fast in order to explain the isotopic equilibrium established between CO 
2 
and CO. In contrast, step (4) cannot be considered as fast, since it allows the 
accumulation of the surface intermediates revealed by various independent 
techniques (SSITKA, temperature transient oxidation and hydrogenation). It can 
neither be considered as highly reversible since only a limited ~2C/13C isotopic 
scrambling was observed for this pool of active surface carbons. Moreover no 
isotopic effect was observed for the overall methane and carbon dioxide 
conversion, indicating that the rate determining step (RDS) of the process does 
not involve C-H bond breakage or formation. Accordingly, step (4) can be 
proposed as rate limiting. This could be due to the fact that it requires relatively 
slow processes such as surface migration of adsorbed O and C species. 
(iii) For all the transient experiments, a kinetic behaviour of H20 close to the 
one of CO 
2 was observed. Evidence of an isotopic H/D scrambling was also 
provided during CH4/CD 
4 equilibration experiments. This strongly suggests 
that water interacts reversibly with the catalytic surface via an adsorption/de- 
sorption equilibrium in a similar way as carbon dioxide: 
H20 + 82 ~ Oad 
s + H 2 
(5) 
The combination of steps 3 and 5 represents the water gas shift (WGS) 
equilibrium, which was shown to be achieved under the present reaction 
conditions [7]. 
This mechanistic scheme was recently nicely confirmed by a TAP experiment 
illustrated in Fig. 5 [8]. It consisted in pulsing in an alternating mode 12CH4 and 
~3CO2 pulses over the Ni/SiO 2 catalyst in order to get information concerning 
the reactive adspecies. The conversion of methane and carbon dioxide amounted 
to 87% and 96%. Hydrogen was produced instantly on the methane pulse (left 
side in Fig. 5), confinning the fast decomposition of methane in step 1. Two 
distinct carbon monoxide responses but with close surface area were observed 
together with the labelled carbon dioxide pulse (right side in Fig. 5): (i) one 
corresponding to labelled CO, almost concomitant with the unconverted labelled 
CO z and without tailing, confirming the fast reversible step 3, (ii) another one 
corresponding to unlabelled CO, markedly delayed and showing a long tail, 
corresponding to the slow step 4. A small peak of unlabelled carbon dioxide

with a maximum corresponding to the unlabelled CO corresponded well to the 
reversible pathway between CO and CO 2. Variations of the time-interval 
between the two pulses did not influence the spectra, which indicated the 
stability of the surface adspecies. 
To conclude, a rather detailed mechanistic proposal was deduced from 
various transient kinetics, leading to an advanced description of the working 
surface. A complete knowledge of the surface occupancy by active species 
would permit to speculate on the exact nature of the active sites. Thus it is likely 
that methane activation requires several Ni atoms to occur (possibly 3 for 
accommodating the surface carbon and others for the H atoms). In contrast, the 
CO 2 activation would be less demanding, since it requires only one surface Ni 
atom for accommodating the oxygen atom and a second one for the transient 
formation of a Ni-CO adspecies. SSITKA with labelled C ISO 
2 are in progress, 
together with TAP experiments to determine precisely the kinetic parameters of

the reaction. Similar kinetic studies are in progress to assess the validity of the 
above proposal on other catalytic systems (other metals and supports). 
2.2. Methane partial oxidation into syngas 
Several interesting studies were recently published on this subject, emphasis- 
ing the use of transient kinetics obtained in a TAP reactor. Key questions are 
addressed such as to determine if (i) the initial activation of methane may 
directly lead to CO and H 2 formation, as suggested by Hickman and Schmidt 
[9,10] on Pt- and Rh- coated monoliths or if (ii) a preliminary combustion step 
of part of the methane into CO 2 and H20 occurs before a further CO 2 and 
steam reforming into syngas, as generally assumed on non-noble catalysts such 
as nickel [11,12]. Mallens et al. [13] recently studied the partial oxidation over 
platinum sponge in the TAP reactor. By feeding the reactor with pulses of 
methane and oxygen they observed that the pulse of produced CO 2 presented 
two maxima. The first one, occurring before the maximum of the CO pulse was 
assigned to a direct combustion of methane with oxygen species which were 
dissolved in the Pt bulk. The second one appeared after the CO maximum and 
was logically assigned to a further oxidation of CO, involving chemisorbed 
oxygen species. The primary oxidation of methane into CO was assumed to 
occur on a third type of oxygen, present as platinum oxide. Thus, these transient 
experiments on the TAP system allowed the authors to conclude that CO was 
formed through the direct partial oxidation, while the total combustion could 
involve both a direct and an indirect route, depending on the type of oxygen 
available on the catalyst. A more quantitative analysis of the TAP system was 
recently attempted by the group from Eindhoven on Rh sponge, based on the 
comparison between experimental and simulated TAP responses [14]. Similar 
conclusions were obtained proposing a direct route for syngas production via a 
Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: the RhzO 3 oxide is reduced by methane which 
allows the latter to be decomposed into carbon and hydrogen atoms. The 
metallic rhodium phase is reoxidized by gaseous oxygen which allows the 
carbon atoms to be oxidized into CO by the lattice oxygen anions. 
At variance with the above studies, indirect pathways were claimed from 
similar TAP experiments carried out on Rh black powder as well as on 
supported Rh, Pt, Pd and Ni catalysts by Baerns et al. [15]. For this case, it was 
observed that CO 2 was a primary product, CO being formed only on partly 
reduced surfaces. Moreover, CO was straightforwardly formed from a pulse of 
CO 2 admitted on a surface prereacted with methane, i.e., precovered with 
carbon deposits. Thus, CO was assumed to be formed from the reverse 
Boudouard reaction. 
These apparent discrepancies underline that the direct or indirect route for 
partial oxidation may depend on very subtle parameters such as the exact state 
of the working surface. Indeed, the TAP experiments were performed at very

317 
low pressure with very low contact time, i.e., under operating conditions far 
away from achieved surface equilibria. Similar experiments should be carried 
out under atmospheric pressure, where indirect routes are much likely to prevail. 
3. Methane activation on oxides 
3.1. Oxidative coupling of methane over basic oxides 
Non-steady-state kinetic techniques were widely used for investigating each 
of the most relevant steps involved in the OCM mechanism, i.e., methane and 
oxygen activation and C 2 and CO 
x formation. 
3.1.1. Methane activation 
The activation of gaseous methane over OCM catalysts has thoroughly been 
discussed in numerous papers, but key mechanistic questions remain open. Two 
main modes of methane activation have to be considered: (i) the reversible 
activation involving a C-H bond breaking, followed by its recombination into a 
gaseous molecule of methane, (ii) the irreversible activation which leads to the 
formation of final products (CO 
x and C2's) or to an accumulation of adspecies 
on the surface. 
3.1.1.1. Reversible methane activation. By investigating the CH4/CD 4 isotopic 
equilibration under OCM reaction conditions [16-19], it was commonly ob- 
served that mostly single exchange (CH 4 + CD 
4 --'-> CH3D + CHD 3, i.e. one 
H/D transfer per step) occurred under the OCM conditions at the early stage of 
the reaction. The stepwise exchange was confirmed by fast pulse experiments 
carried out in a TAP reactor [20]. CH4/CD 4 experiments performed in our 
laboratory on a series of rare-earth oxides [21] pointed to a direct relationship 
between the intrinsic rate of exchange and the ionic radius of the considered 
REO, which is related to the solid basicity. 
On the basis of the early works of Tanabe and co-workers devoted to methane 
exchange on solid bases [22], the above features provide a strong evidence that 
the reversible activation of methane on OCM catalysts is initiated by the 
heterolytic abstraction of a H + on the basic sites O 2- of the surface, the 
remaining methyl anion CH 3 being linked to the surface cations Mn + according 
tO: 
CH 4 + M n++ 0 2- ~ CHUM n++ OH- 
(6) 
3.1.1.2. Irreversible methane activation. The present literature status concerning 
the irreversible activation of methane can be summarised as follows: 
(i) It is now agreed that for the selective route leading to C2's, methane must 
be activated into methyl radicals released into the gas phase. As a matter of fact, 
318 
Y. Schuurman, C. Mirodatos /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)305-331 
the detection of radicals far from the surface has unambiguously been demon- 
strated by several techniques among which ESR [23], photo ionisation mass 
spectrometry [24,25] and more recently conventional mass spectrometry in the 
TAP reactor [20,26]. 
(ii) The way to activate methane into methyl radicals through either het- 
erolytic or homolytic splitting remains widely controversial. 
Heterolytic splitting. It is assumed that the anionic species CH 3 issued from 
the reversible activation of methane on anion/cation pairs of the oxide surface 
may react with an electron acceptor to form a methyl radical, as follows: 
CH3M n+ --+ CH 3 • + e- 
(7) 
The nature of the electron acceptor itself remains a matter of discussion. In a 
review, Sokolovskii and Mamedov [19] proposed several types of active centres, 
depending on the catalyst nature. On hardly reducible oxide such as MgO, 
coordinatively unsaturated cations, possibly developed after alkali doping, could 
act as electrophilic species able to abstract the electron from CH 3. For oxides 
with multiple degrees of oxidation, either the metal ions themselves, or some 
electrophilic forms of oxygen, or defects of the crystalline lattice could act as 
active centres for the generation of methyl radicals. The thesis of the heterolytic 
splitting of the methane C-H bond in the OCM process was also supported by 
Maitra [27], on the basis of a critical evaluation of the performances of a wide 
range of OCM catalysts. The methyl anions CH 3 would react with gaseous 
oxygen, acting as electron acceptor, as follows: 
CH 3 + 02 --+ CH 3 • + 0 2 
(8) 
The peroxidic species is assumed to be further transformed into lattice oxide 
0 2- by complex surface equilibria favoured by high electrical conductivity. 
This species could also initiate the CO 
x formation, though, as admitted by the 
authors, no clear pathway can be proposed for this unselective route. A critical 
analysis of this proposal is developed in [28], based on the general observation 
that no direct correlation exists between the rate of irreversible methane 
conversion and the rate of reversible CH4/CD 
4 isotopic equilibration. 
Homolytic splitting. Originally proposed by Lunsford and co-workers [29], 
this is the most widely accepted mechanism for the irreversible activation of 
methane into methyl radicals. The main elementary steps of the process may be 
written as follows:

Methane adsorption under the OCM conditions. As a rule, no measurable 
hold-up of reversible methane was observed by isotopic transient techniques 
over OCM catalysts [30,31]. This observation was confirmed through TAP 
experiments (within the time resolution of around one millisecond) where pulses 
of methane admitted onto samaria [20] or lanthana [26] catalysts at OCM 
temperature were found unchanged after crossing the reactor. This agrees with 
the assumption of an Eley-Rideal mechanism for methane activation (Eq. (9)). 
This does not contradict, however, the fast heterolytic and reversible interaction 
with the surface which monitors the CH4/CD 
4 equilibration. 
Oxygen activation. SSITKA experiments where 1602 was switched to ~802 at 
the reactor inlet and TAP experiments, where fast pulses of 1602 or 1802 were 
admitted onto the catalyst bed, were found to be extremely informative tech- 
niques for studying this second key step in the OCM process. Peil et al. [32] 
have reviewed most of the relevant experiments carried out by SSITKA. An 
example of SSITK curves obtained in our laboratory on lanthana catalyst is 
reported in Fig. 6a,b. Several features could be deduced from these curves: 
(i) in the absence of methane (Fig. 6a), a fast dissociative oxygen 
adsorption/desorption equilibrium establishes between the gas phase and the 
surface, attested by the statistical isotopic distribution of oxygen atoms. Super- 
imposed with this equilibrium, a slow exchange surface-to-bulk lattice oxygen 
proceeds. This is indicated by the continuous feeding of the gas phase by 160 
atoms after the switch to ~802. All the lattice oxygen atoms were found to 
participate in this surface-to-bulk exchange over La203 catalyst. 
(ii) in the presence of methane, i.e. under the reaction conditions, both the 
fast gas phase-to-surface exchange and the lattice exchange are markedly 
slackened (Fig. 6b). However the bulk diffusivity remains fast enough to allow a 
significant amount of subsurface oxygen to participate in the reaction. This 
inhibiting effect of the OCM reaction on the oxygen exchange suggests that 
intermediates of the reaction such as hydroxyl and carbonate groups (observed 
as traces by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy) are competing with oxygen on the 
adsorption sites. 
TAP experiments brought new insights in that complex surface chemistry. 
Significant residence times of oxygen onto the catalytic surface were detected at 
reaction temperature on selective catalysts such as samaria [20] and lanthana 
[26], but not on non-selective catalysts such as MgO [20]. This result confirms 
that oxygen strongly interacts with the surface for active and selective catalysts. 
Pulses of 1802 were almost totally incorporated into the reservoir of lattice 
oxygen, which released mostly 1602, confirming the SSITK results on bulk 
migration. 
In the presence of methane, the residence time of the dissociated oxygen 
decreased markedly, supporting the assumption that the reaction of dissociated 
oxygen with methane is faster than the recombination into diatomic 02 
molecules.

The interaction between methane and oxygen was also studied in the TAP 
reactor by sequential pulses of oxygen and of methane, varying the time interval 
between the two types of pulses. Fig. 7A illustrates that type of experiment 
carried out on a lanthana catalyst [26]. For each time interval the amount of 
products detected at the reactor outlet was evaluated, as reported in Fig. 7B: 
(i) When the two pulses are not overlapping, they are identical to the pulses 
obtained when either pure oxygen or pure methane is admitted onto the catalyst.

As soon as the methane pulse overlaps the oxygen pulse, part of the oxygen is 
instantaneously consumed and the methane peak is decreased, as depicted on 
Fig. 7A. 
(ii) Except for CO 2, not detected since mostly trapped on the catalyst, the 
OCM products are detected in phase with the methane pulse, as also observed 
on Sm203 [20]. 
(iii) The C 2 amount is maximal when oxygen and methane are pulsed 
together (Fig. 7B), i.e. when the amount of gaseous oxygen in contact with 
methane is the highest. 
From these data it may be concluded that for lanthana catalyst, there is no 
measurable time lag between oxygen activation and methane conversion. This 
agrees well with the very short residence time of surface oxygen deduced from 
SSITKA and TAP experiments. Furthermore it strengthens the idea that the 
adspecies resulting from the reversible oxygen activation are directly involved in 
the process of methyl radical generation. 
It must be pointed out, however, that the absence of time lag between oxygen 
activation and methane conversion holds for lanthanum oxide, which is a 
non-reducible oxide. By contrast Statman et al. [33] and Buyevskaya et al. [20] 
observed that on samarium oxide the active oxygen species are formed in a 
relatively slower activation process. 
Thus, two performing and rather close rare earth oxides (REO) catalysts may 
present distinct behaviours concerning the key step of oxygen activation. 
Thus, dissociation of oxygen was shown to be necessary for the irreversible 
activation of methane into methyl radicals. Furthermore gas phase-to-surface 
and surface-to-bulk equilibria establish between the gaseous molecular oxygen 
and the lattice ions. However the absence of spectroscopic techniques able to 
work at high temperature and pressure (EPR, XPS, HREELS, Laser RAMAN 
spectroscopy) impedes any concluding identification of the actual active oxygen 
adspecies. 
3.1.2. Ethane formation 
It is now well agreed that ethane is formed by the combination of two methyl 
radicals, possibly in the presence of a third, energetically required, body (inert 
gas or methane molecules) [34,35]. Recent kinetic studies carded out in the TAP 
reactor have brought interesting results on the important question whether that 
reaction takes place on the catalyst surface or in the gas phase [20,26]. From 
pulses of the reaction mixture CHn/O2/He admitted into the TAP reactor, the 
conversions and selectivities (including the selectivity to methyl radicals, calcu- 
lated from the changes in the ratio amul5/amul6) were evaluated for various 
gas diffusion regimes (Knudsen at very low pulse intensity and partially 
molecular at high pulse intensity). The methyl radicals were detected at the TAP 
reactor outlet essentially under the Knudsen gas diffusion regime (around 68% 
of the converted methane). When the CH 3 • radical concentration decreased 
Y. Schuurman, C. Mirodatos / Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 305-331 
323 
under higher gas phase pressure, the C 2 hydrocarbon concentration increased. 
Thus the coupling was favoured when gas collisions were enhanced (i.e. for 
viscous diffusion regime), tending to demonstrate that the coupling of methyl 
radicals takes place in the gas phase and not on the surface, in agreement with 
the results of Feng et al. [24,25]. 
3.1.3. CO 
2 formation 
CO 2 may be formed either from the direct combustion of methane, or from 
subsequent combustion of the C 2 hydrocarbons or of CO. Due to the fact that 
the homogeneous oxidation in the gas phase via the formation of methylperoxy 
radicals has been found unlikely at the OCM temperature [17], only surface 
chemistry has to be considered for the total oxidation route. In order to identify 
the main CO 2 routes, SSITKA experiments were carried out in our laboratory 
both by tracing the oxygen and the carbon atoms in the process of methane 
oxidation [26]. 
The transient response of carbon dioxide to a 1602/~802 switch under OCM 
conditions revealed that the oxygen atoms of CO 2 molecules are always in 
statistical equilibrium at the reactor outlet (Fig. 6c), at variance with the gaseous 
oxygen as shown in Fig. 6b. The isotopic scrambling observed for COo 
indicates that the latter is formed on the surface, from a pool of scrambled 166 
and 180 atoms. Furthermore, CO 2 is expected to interact with the surface by 
forming transient carbonate species. It is therefore likely that the CO 2 molecules, 
once formed, undergo several desorption/readsorption processes before coming 
out of the reactor. 
By labelling the carbon atoms of methane (switch ~2CH4/13CH4) over a 
lanthana catalyst, a significant time lag was observed between the carbon 
dioxide and the unconverted methane transients (at variance with the C 2 
products, always superimposed with the methane curves). Integrating that delay 
provided the mean residence time of carbon dioxide in the system and after 
proper corrections due to chromatographic effects along the catalyst bed [1,32], 
the true residence time "r' of a CO 2 precursor on the surface was determined. 
From this residence time '-r' and from the overall rate of CO 2 formation 'rco2', 
an evaluation of the concentration of the oxidation sites was deduced from the 
pseudo-first order rate equation: 
rco 
2 
= 1/z ]concentration of oxidation sites]. 
(12) 
This concentration of total oxidation sites (0.8 Ixmol/m 
2) was found to 
compare nicely with the concentration of surface defects evaluated from TEM 
pictures, especially regular steps on the outer planes of the particles (1.0 
ixmol/m2). These edge atoms can be considered as low coordination ions, 
according to Che and Tench [36]. Thus, the total oxidation of methane would 
proceed preferentially on very localised sites, characterized by a high degree of 
unsaturation. 
324 
Y. Sehuurman, C. Mirodatos /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997) 305-331 
On the basis of the above observations, a process was proposed for the total 
oxidation of methane, where the methyl radicals react with coordinatively 
unsaturated surface oxygen atoms into methoxide ions, followed by a sequence 
of surface oxidation steps leading to carbonate groups, in equilibrium with 
gaseous carbon dioxide. 
Thus, state-of-the-art transient kinetic techniques have demonstrated their 
ability for investigating the activation of methane and oxygen under OCM 
conditions. However, despite interesting quantification and correlation between 
transient kinetics and physico-chemical data, these results still include a large 
amount of speculations and further improvements in the applied techniques are 
obviously required. As an example, let us quote the very interesting paper 
recently published by Nibbelke et al. [37] providing a detailed mathematical 
analysis of transient OCM data, confirming most of the above mechanistic 
conclusions. 
3.2. Methane aromatization over acid oxides 
As for methane activation on solid bases, it was long reported that methane 
could be activated in acid homogeneous medium. Thus, homologation of 
methane into higher hydrocarbons was found to occur in the presence of 
ultra-strong acids [38]. A CH~- intermediate was suggested to form in the 
presence of protons, further decomposed into CH~- and H 2. Thus, in homoge- 
neous acid catalysis, the heterolytic splitting of methane would give CH~- and 
H-, the H- species combining easily with protons from the acid medium to 
form H 2. Several attempts to activate methane on acid solids in the presence or 
in the absence of oxidant were recently reported. 
The oxidative homologation of methane to higher hydrocarbons and aromatic 
products was reported using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants over ZSM-5 
zeolite catalysts [39-41]. Han and co-workers [42,43] reported the direct partial 
oxidation of CH 4 with 0 2 on HZSM-5 and metal containing ZSM-5 catalysts in 
the presence of propane additive at 713-733 K. The conversion of methane to 
benzene over high silica zeolite based catalyst in a pulse reactor was briefly 
reported, suggesting that the formation of aromatics possibly proceeds via an 
ethene intermediate [44]. The activity for deuterium-hydrogen exchange be- 
tween deuterated methane and HZSM-5 has also been investigated [45,46]. 
A promising route was recently investigated, which consists in producing 
ethylene and benzene in the absence of oxygen on Mo/HZSM-5 [47]. The 
methane conversion was 6-8% at 973 K while the selectivity to aromatics is 
higher than 90%. Further studies revealed that the strong acid sites and channel 
structure of HZSM-5 and the state and location of Mo species were crucial 
factors for the good catalytic performance of Mo/HZSM-5 [48,49]. HZSM-5 
zeolite is a solid acid and therefore, methane activation on Mo/HZSM-5 can be 
regarded as an example of an acid-assisted heterolytic splitting process.

Fig. 8. Normalized responses for CH4, C02, 
H 2, H20, C2H 4 and CrH 6 after the initial switch He -* 
CH 4/He/At at 700°C over Mo/HZSM-5. 
In continuation of this work, transient kinetic experiments were carried out in 
our laboratory on Mo/HZSM-5 aimed at understanding the nature of methane 
activation in a highly complex mechanism, which is likely to involve numerous 
steps, reaction intermediates and active sites [50]. 
A first transient experiment consisted in observing the catalyst behaviour 
during the reaction start-up at 700°C by switching from an Ar/He to a CHa/He 
flow (Fig. 8A,B). During this initial period, at least three different reaction steps 
occurred in sequence: (i) from 0 to 200 s, CO (not reported due to MS 
fragmentation uncertainties), CO 2 and H 20 were the main products with a slight 
production of H 2 and C2H 4, (ii) from 200 to about 400 s, H 2 and C2H 4 
formation increased markedly, while a second maximum in CO 2 and H20 
production was observed, (iii) after 400 s, C6H 6 appeared at the reactor exit, 
which corresponded to a strong decrease in C2H4, 
CO 2 and H20 production. 
The transient production of CO 
X and H20 can be assigned to a catalyst 
reduction in a stoichiometric way leading to a new active phase. From the 
amount of produced CO 
x and H20, the formation of Mo2C could be envisioned, 
in agreement with recent XPS data reported by Wang et al. [51]. Thus, this 
326 
Y. Schuurman, C. Mirodatos /Applied Catalysis A: General 151 (1997)305-331 
start-up transient experiment suggests that the stoichiometric reduction of a large 
amount of the initial MoO 3 into molybdenum carbide is a prerequisite for 
producing the target aromatic products. From the observation of two reduction 
steps, it could additionally be speculated that the first step corresponded to the 
reduction of the Mo phase located outside the zeolite, while the internal phase, 
less accessible and probably more dispersed (stabilised ions), would be reduced 
more slowly. Within this scheme, it can be noted that the formation of ethylene, 
residual after the external deposits reduction, was boosted during the reduction 
of the internal deposits. In contrast, the benzene formation started only when the 
reduction of the internal deposits was completed. Note that the latter observation 
strongly suggests that ethylene is an intermediate product between methane and 
aromatics. This statement was confirmed by the observation of benzene forma- 
tion after ethylene pulses in the TAP reactor [50]. 
Further TPO experiments clearly revealed the accumulation of non-desorbing 
polyaromatics products which contributed to the catalyst deactivation. When 
switching back to the inert He/Ar mixture, no delay is observed for methane 
(no reversible accumulation) but a significant delay is observed for C 2 and C 6 
responses, which indicated some accumulation of these products. 
H tracing SSITKA experiments were carried out by switching from cn 4 to 
CD 
4 or from CD 4 to CH 4 at the reactor inlet. By using an in situ DRIFT cell as 
microreactor, the changes in the IR spectra of the zeolite were also recorded 
during the transient at 700°C (one spectrum per second). Fig. 9 reports the 
normalized transient concentration of unconverted methane (Fig. 9a), of pro- 
duced benzene (Fig. 9b), and of the optical density of the ZSM-5 OH and OD 
bands at 3583 and 2640 cm-1, respectively (Fig. 9c). It can be seen that the 
three series of isotopic transients occurred in about the same period of time 
(within 300 s), which underlines the strong coupling in the related phenomena. 
All partially deuterated intermediates were observed for methane (and therefore 
logically for benzene) during the transient. This exchange was furthermore 
directly related to the pool of exchangeable OH (or OD) groups of the zeolite 
(about 80% of the total hydroxyl groups). These data clearly indicate that the 
methane activation including C-H bond breakage is reversible under the reac- 
tion conditions. Moreover, the isotope distribution during the transient also 
strongly suggests that the isotopic exchange proceeds according a step-wise 
mechanism, i.e., each H (or D) being exchanged atomically, in agreement with 
the hypothesis of a heterolytic activation, assisted by the zeolite protons. 
Carbon tracing SSITKA experiments were performed by switching from 
12CH4 to 13CH4 at the reactor inlet (Fig. 10). From the delay observed between 
the inert tracer and the methane curves, a rather large reversible methane 
accumulation (180 Ixmol/gca 
t) occurred on the catalyst which may be related to 
the reversible activation observed with the H tracing [50]. In contrast, only very 
small amounts of ethylene precursors were found to accumulate under steady- 
state conditions (1.6 ixmol/gcat), indicating a very small concentration of active

may correspond to the storage of benzene precursors on the zeolite acid sites 
leading to the H/D exchange. It could also come from the existence of the 
carbon pool constituted by the molybdenum carbide deposits, slowly exchanging 
with the active sites for methane dimerization. 
Thus, from these transient experiments completed with recent TAP data still 
under progress, several types of sites could be involved in the aromatization 
process such as (i) acid sites for the heterolytic methane activation (which was 
found to occur also in the absence of Mo ions), (ii) molybdenum phases 
(external and/or internal) for the methane dimerization coupling into ethylene, 
and (iii) again acid sites within the zeolitic matrix to allow ethylene to be

polymerised into benzene [48,49]. The main steps of the aromatization process 
could be schematised as: 
-- irreversible dimerization of methane over Mo clusters in the zeolite.

4. Conclusions 
In situ techniques, in essence the isotopic transient kinetics, were shown to 
apply extremely well under the severe conditions required by most of the 
methane activation processes. Thus, SSITKA measurements restricted to the 
slowest steps of the investigated reactions and/or TAP measurements informa- 
tive within the millisecond range brought unique information on key mechanistic 
steps such as the mode of methane activation, and possibly the mode of oxygen 
activation for oxidative processes. Fast temperature transients and coupled in 
situ DRIFT spectroscopy were also shown to contribute significantly to the 
quantitative description of the working surface and to the development of a 
'micro kinetic' reaction mechanism. Among the three main modes of methane 
activation, the reactions of partial oxidation and dry reforming on metal catalysts 
tend to present now a rather well advanced level of understanding. In contrast, 
numerous questions remain open for the activation of methane on basic and on 
acid solids in the presence or in the absence of oxidant. This may be due to the 
various sites involved in the processes and the possible contribution of gas phase 
chemistry in addition to surface phenomena, for which the presently available 
transient techniques may not apply correctly any more.
