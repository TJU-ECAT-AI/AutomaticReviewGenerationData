The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts 
has been studied under non-oxidizing 
conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and 
with a temperature programmed reactor. The results show that benzene is the only hydrocar- 
bon product of 
the catalytic conversion of 
methane at high temperature (973 K). The catalytic 
activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn). HE and 
ethene have been directly detected in the products with a mass spectrometer during TPAR. A 
carbenium ion 
mechanism for the activation of 
methane 
is suggested.

1. Introduction 
The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel 
is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also 
a great challenge to catalysis science. Recently the partial oxidation and oxidative 
coupling of methane have been extensively studied, but many problems are still left. 
Meanwhile, the fact that aromatic products can be formed by the oxidation of 
methane over ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been reported [1,2], but little success was 
achieved in obtaining a useful selectivity or yield of aromatics. A few results for 
the conversion of methane to benzene over high silica zeolite based catalysts in a 
pulse-reactor had been briefly reported [3], but only very limited information was 
provided from which it is not possible to assess the course of the reaction or its main 
mechanistic features. Lately Claridge et al. reported their studies of the conversion 
of methane : oxygen mixtures to aromatics over metal oxides and supported metal

catalysts [4]. They claimed that over K/BaCO3 and/or NaC1/MnO2 catalysts, the 
conversion was about 13% with the selectivity to aromatics of 18-23% under the 
reaction temperature of 1223 K. The authors also suggested that the formation of 
aromatics possibly proceeds via an ethene intermediate. The present paper reports 
on the dehydrogenation 
and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing 
condi- 
tions on modified 
ZSM-5 catalysts. The activation of methane on bifunctional cat- 
alysts is discussed in terms ofa carbenium ion mechanism. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. MATERIALS 
The ZSM-5 zeolites were supplied by Nankai University and are commercially 
available (SIO2/A1203 = 25, 50). Firstly, the ZSM-5 zeolites were converted into 
ammonium forms (NHaZSM-5) by repeated ion exchange (four times) with a 1 N 
NH4NO3 aqueous solution at around 368 K for 1 h. These were then dried at 383 K 
for 4 h. HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by calcining NHaZSM-5 at 773 K for 
4 h. MHZSM-5 (M---Mo, Zn) catalysts were prepared by impregnating 
NHaZSM-5 with ammonium molybdate or zinc nitrate aqueous solution, then 
drying at 383 K for 4 h and calcining at 773 K for 4 h. The metal loading was 2% 
in weight. Finally, the catalysts were pressed, crushed and sorted into sizes of 
10-30 mesh. 
Methane was 99.995% pure. Analysis of the air and helium used showed the 
absence of any H2 and hydrocarbons. 
2.2. CATALYTIC TESTS 
The catalytic tests were carried out with about 2.0 g catalyst placed in a fixed 
bed continuous-flow stainless steel reactor. The catalyst zone was heated under an 
air stream to 973 K and held at 973 K for 30 min. After pretreatment, methane 
was introduced into the catalyst bed through a flowmeter. The hourly space velo- 
city of methane is around 1440 ml/g h. The products were withdrawn periodically 
from the outlet of the reactor and analyzed by gas chromatography. Aliphatic and 
aromatic hydrocarbons were separated on a 4 m long squalane column and 
detected with a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The conversion and selectivity 
were calculated on the carbon number basis. 
2.3. TEMPERATURE PROGRAMMED AROMATIZATION 
REACTION (TPAR) 
Fig. 1 shows a scheme of the setup used in this work for TPAR experiments. 
TPAR were carried out in a quartz tubular microflow 
reactor containing 0.2 g cata- 
lyst. Firstly, the catalysts were heated to 973 K at 32 K/min in a He stream and

held at 973 K for 30 min. Then, the reactor was brought to room temperature. At 
room temperature the stream was switched from 50 ml/min He to 30 ml/min of 
methane. Finally, TPAR was started by programming the temperature increase 
from room temperature to 1073 K at 16 K/min. The signals corresponding to 
H2 (m/e = 2), C 
2 (m/e = 26), C O (m/e = 30), and C6H6 (m/e = 78) as a function 
of temperature (time) were recorded with a TE-150 mass spectrometer. The reac- 
tion system pressure was kept at 40 kPa. 
3. Results 
The reaction results of methane on various ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts are summar- 
ized in table 1. The HZSM-5 catalyst shows a little activity for the conversion of 
methane at 973 K with a selectivity to benzene of 100%. The conversion of methane 
was greatly increased by loading Mo or Zn ion in the zeolites without any loss in 
the selectivity to benzene. MoHZSM-5 exhibited the best activity, while neither

MoNaZSM-5 nor MoO3 has any activity for the reaction. The MoHZSM-5 cata- 
lyst was quite stable for the reaction under the given condition as shown in fig. 2. 
The conversion of methane over MoHZSM-5 increased 
with increasing the partial 
pressure of methane as shown in table 2. The selectivity 
to benzene of 100% under 
non-oxidizing 
conditions is of significance. It obviously depends on the nature of 
the catalyst used. 
A study by TPAR over HZSM-5, ZnHZSM-5 and MoHZSM-5 zeolites gave 
further evidence as shown in figs. 3-5. Two important observations can be made 
from the results: (1) The starting temperature for the dehydro-aromatization of 
methane over MoHZSM-5 is about 973 K, which is about 50 K lower than that 
over ZnHZSM-5. HZSM-5 zeolites did not exhibit any activity for the aromatiza- 
tion under the given experimental conditions. (2) Ethene and H2 can be directly 
detected from TPAR and both evolved 
over MoHZSM-5 at about 973 K, which is 
the same temperature at which 
benzene 
evolved. 
4. Discussion and conclusion 
The comparison between the catalytic behavior of HZSM-5 and MHZSM-5 
(M = Mo, Zn) showed 
that the activity for the dehydro-aromatization 
of 
methane 
is enhanced by loading Mo or Zn in HZSM-5 zeolite. With respect to the role 
of Zn in the conversion of propane into aromatics over ZnHZSM-5, Mole and 
Anderson [5] suggested 
the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient 
species such as [Zn-H] 
+. In an analogous manner, we suggest that the activation 
of 
methane over HZSM-5 and MHZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is via the carbenium 
ion

Cid et al. reported the physicochemical characterization of MoO3-NaY zeolite cat- 
alysts prepared by impregnation of NaY zeolite with aqueous solutions of ammo- 
nium heptamolybdate [6]. They found that the preparation procedure results in a 
substantial loss in crystallinity and surface area with Mo loadings beyond 7% 
MOO3. At relatively low Mo loadings, Mo species appear to be well dispersed on 
the zeolite, and mostly within the zeolite cavities as strongly attached tetrahedrally 
coordinated MOO]-. Dong et al. studied the dispersion and surface state of MoO3 
on ZSM-5 zeolite [7]. The sample was prepared by the solid reaction between 
MoO3 and ZSM-5 at 723 K for 24 h. Due to the strong interaction between MoO3 
and the framework of zeolite during calcination, MoO3 migrates into the cavities of 
ZSM-5 zeolite and disperses as a non-crystalline surface species. Based on the

ions in tetrahedral coordination and another in octahedral coordination. By refer- 
ence to the above-mentioned publications, in the case of MoHZSM-5 catalyst,

aromatics or C 2 products under non-oxidizing conditions. Thermodynamically, 
dehydro-aromatization of methane is a more favorable reaction than dehydro- 
dimerization. The thermodynamic data are shown in table 3. Thus, the high selec- 
tivity to benzene is achieved at higher temperatures, but at lower temperature, ben- 
zene is not obtained. 
The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and 
selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing 
conditions. The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane 
activation. The aromatization reaction of methane with a conversion of 7-8% and 
the selectivity to benzene of 100% is quite stable over MoHZSM-5 catalyst under 
the given conditions. H2 and ethene may be the primary products in the conversion 
of methane to benzene. The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pres- 
sure of methane.
