The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been in-
vestigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an
added oxidant. The reaction is characterized by an induction pe-
riod, prior to the initiation of benzene production, during which
Mo2C is formed and coke deposition occurs. The formation of the
carbide was conﬁrmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements. Pretreatment of the catalyst in a CH4/H2 gas mix-
ture at 700◦C reduces Mo6+ ions in the calcined catalyst into Mo2C
and almost eliminates the induction period, conﬁrming that Mo2C
is the active species in the activation of methane. Under typical
CH4 reaction conditions at 700◦C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+
ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring
primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions. These nonreducible Mo
ions are most likely within the channels of the zeolite. XPS, ion-
scattering spectroscopy, and FT-IR measurements indicate that Mo
species in a Mo/ZSM-5 sample dried at 130◦C are present as small
(30 to 50 ˚
A) crystallites of the original ammonium heptamolybdate
impregnated salt on the external surface of the zeolite. After calcina-
tion at higher temperatures (500–700◦C), Mo becomes more highly
dispersed, but not uniformly distributed, on the external surface of
the zeolite. During preparation and/or pretreatment of the catalyst,
a portion of the Mo ions diffuses into the channels of the zeolite.
The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the tem-
perature, time, and atmosphere of calcination. The roles of Mo2C,
partially reduced Mo ions, and the origin of the induction period
are discussed on the basis of kinetic results and physical/chemical
characterization measurements of the catalyst.

INTRODUCTION
Direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons,
particularly to aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and
naphthalene, in the absence of gas-phase oxygen has re-
ceived considerable recent attention. Although the for-
mation of aromatic products from CH4 in the absence of
O2 is not thermodynamically favorable at low tempera-
tures (
<500◦C), the equilibrium CH4 conversion at 700◦C
is ∼12%. At this temperature, benzene and naphthalene,
in approximately equimolar amounts, are the thermody-

namically preferred products. The thermodynamic equilib-
rium composition of the C–H system (excluding graphite)
at 1 atm pressure is shown in Fig. 1 for the temperature
range 500–1200◦C.
Bragin et al. (1) have carried out the aromatization re-
action of methane to benzene in a pulse reactor over a
Pt–CrO3/HZSM-5 catalyst at 750◦C. A methane conver-
sion of 18% with 80% selectivity to benzene was achieved.
Belgued et al. (2) found that exposure of a supported Pt
catalyst to pure methane, followed by hydrogenation, can
result in the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons contain-
ing up to six carbon atoms. Formation of C2 to C6 alkanes
from methane in a two-step route was also achieved on
Group VIII transition metal catalysts (3). None of these
previously reported processes, however, was carried out in
a continuous-ﬂow reactor.
Several recent studies of methane conversion to aromat-
ics have been carried out over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts in
ﬂow reactors. Wang et al. (4) reported that a methane con-
version of 7% could be achieved at a benzene selectivity of
100%. Solymosi and co-workers (5–8) observed a benzene
selectivity of ∼65% at a methane conversion of 5.7%. In
our previous investigations (9, 10), we observed that, fol-
lowing an initial induction period, a benzene selectivity of
∼70% at a methane conversion of 8% could be sustained
for more than 16 h. Although a similar catalytic perfor-
mance has been reported by several groups for CH4 conver-
sion over Mo/ZSM-5, differing active sites, reaction mech-
anisms, and reaction intermediates have been proposed
(5, 10–13) by the various investigators.
One group (11, 14–16), for example, has suggested that
MoO3 may be involved as the catalytically active center,
and that dimerization of a CH2=
=MoO3 species occurs to
produce ethylene as the reaction intermediate. They as-
sumed that methane may be heterolytically split to CH+
3
and H−over the acid sites in the channels of the ZSM-5
zeolite (11), and that molybdenum species in a high oxida-
tion state promote such heterolytic dissociation of the C–H
bond. Based on XPS results, they proposed that methane
activation may be associated with Mo6+, Mo5+, and Mo4+
ions (15). In this reaction scheme, however, the role of

acid sites in the activation of methane, as suggested earlier,
was not addressed. Chen and co-workers (12) carried out
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin res-
onance, and temperature-programmed reduction measure-
ments of fresh and used Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts and concluded
that methane was activated to form CH3· radicals via a syn-
ergistic action between MoOx and Brønsted acidic sites, and
that ethane, rather than ethylene, was produced as the pri-
mary product. These authors propose that the active oxygen
species is removed during the reaction by the reduction of
molybdenum ions by methane. Solymosi and co-workers
(5) investigated the dehydrogenation of methane on var-
ious supported MoO3 catalysts, including MoO3/SiO2 and
MoO3/ZSM-5, and proposed that partially reduced molyb-
denum ions, probably Mo4+, are responsible for the acti-
vation of methane, and particularly for the formation of
benzene.
By contrast, in our previous studies (9, 10) we demon-
strated that exposure of a calcined Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to
CH4 at 700◦C causes reduction of molybdenum ions to the
carbide,Mo2C,whichwasidentiﬁedbyXPS.Disappearance
of Mo6+ from the original MoO3 and formation of Mo2C
were virtually complete after exposure of the calcined cata-
lyst to CH4 for 2 h, which corresponds to the time of the
initial activation period. It was suggested that Mo2C may
be the active species responsible for the initial activation
of methane. This proposal was supported by the observa-
tions that unsupported Mo2C can also activate methane,
and that the addition of CO2 to the reactant stream reoxi-
dizes Mo2C to Mo6+, Mo5+, and Mo4+ ions, causing a com-
plete loss of activity for the formation of benzene. In their
most recent studies, Solymosi and co-workers (6–8) have
also concluded that MoC2 is involved in the initial activa-
tion of CH4 over Mo/ZSM-5. Discrepancies among various
groups in identifying the active molybdenum species for
CH4 activation may result from the different sample treat-
ments that have been employed prior to obtaining XPS
spectra, since Mo2C is readily reoxidized when exposed to
air, even for a short time. Another difﬁculty in conﬁrming
the formation of Mo2C by XPS measurements is that the
carbidic C1s signal overlaps with that of abundant other
forms of surface carbon, particularly coke, that are formed
under typical reaction conditions (10).
An additional area of disagreement concerns the distri-
bution of Mo in the ZSM-5 zeolite. No conclusive evidence
has been reported in previous investigations regarding the
location of Mo in the zeolite, although most researchers
agree that molybdenum ions are highly dispersed and are
distributed through the zeolite channels (4, 6, 9–12, 14–18).
Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET, and NH3 adsorp-
tion/desorption results, Guo and co-workers (11, 14, 16)
and Lin and co-workers (12) have suggested that Mo may
be in a highly dispersed state in their 2% Mo/ZSM-5 cata-
lysts. However, when the Mo loading was in the range 6 to
10 wt%, the presence of crystalline MoO3 was conﬁrmed by
XRD and FT-IR measurements. At this level of Mo load-
ing, the BET surface area (11, 12, 16), micropore volume
(11, 12), ZSM-5 crystallinity (11), NH3 uptake/desorption
(12, 14, 16), and activity of the catalyst for the conversion of
methane (11, 12) all decreased signiﬁcantly from their val-
ues at 2 wt% Mo loading. These results were interpreted
as evidence that Mo was located within the channels of the
ZSM-5 (11, 12, 16). However, it is difﬁcult to determine
whether the decreases in surface area and NH3 uptake re-
sult from extensive blockage of the channel entrances or are
due to migration of Mo within the channels. The amount of
Mo needed for monolayer coverage on the external surface
of ZSM-5, assuming a crystallite size of 0.3 µm and uni-
form Mo distribution, for example, is only about 0.6 wt%.
Therefore, it is very likely that the formation of multilay-
ers of Mo oxides that occur at high Mo loadings may re-
sult in extensive blockage of the channel entrances. When
the Mo loading is high and the sample is calcined at high
temperature, e.g., at 700◦C for several hours, Mo may dif-
fuse into the zeolite channels. However, because the activ-
ity for methane conversion decreases signiﬁcantly at high
Mo loadings (11, 12), no conclusion can be made regard-
ing the distribution of the active Mo species in the ZSM-5
zeolite.
Based on characterizations by XRD, acidity and catalytic
activity for Brønsted acid-catalyzed reactions, Valyon and
Meszaros-Kis (19) suggested that Mo in a conventionally
prepared Mo-impregnated HZSM-5 sample is located pri-
marily on the external zeolite surface, but that Mo could
be homogeneously distributed inside the channels of the

zeolite by contacting HZSM-5 with Mo(x-C3H5)4 in pen-
tane. In a study of a Mo/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 400) catalyst used
for hydrodesulfurization reactions, Fierro and co-workers
(20, 21) concluded that most of the Mo exists as MoO3 on
the external zeolite surface.
In the present investigation, we have addressed in greater
detail than previously the formation of Mo2C and the role
of the carbidic species in the conversion of methane to aro-
matic products, based on results of kinetic and XPS mea-
surements of a Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst under well-controlled
pretreatment conditions. The role of the carbide in activat-
ing CH4 was explored by intentionally preparing Mo2C on
the ZSM-5 support and comparing its catalytic behavior to
that of a catalyst originating as MoO3/ZSM-5. In addition,
XPS, ISS, and FT-IR techniques were employed to provide
greater insight into the distribution of molybdenum in the
ZSM-5 zeolite. Particular emphasis was placed on elucidat-
ing the differing behaviors of the Mo located on the external
surface of the zeolite support and that located within the
zeolitic channels.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation
The catalyst was prepared by making a slurry of 10 g of
H-ZSM-5 (Conteka B.V. 5020, Si/Al = 25) in 20 ml of an
aqueous solution containing the desired amount of ammo-
nium heptamolybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24] at 85◦C for 16 h, fol-
lowed by drying for 4 h at 120◦C and then calcining for 4 h at
500◦C in air. The calcined samples were crushed and sieved
to 20/45 mesh granules. Since all of the Mo-containing solu-
tion was deposited onto the H-ZSM-5 support during dry-
ing, the Mo content in the ﬁnal catalyst was assumed to be
the same as the total Mo content of the solution, and was
not separately analyzed. All experiments were performed
using 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 samples.
Reactor System
Reactions were carried out in a ﬂow system, using re-
actors constructed from alumina tubes (Coors, AD-998,
99.8% Al2O3) having an i.d. of 6.4 mm and using 1.0 g of
catalyst, unless otherwise speciﬁed. To minimize the con-
tribution from gas-phase reactions, quartz chips were used
to ﬁll the space above and below the catalyst beds in the
ﬂow reactors. A thermocouple in a smaller alumina tube
was attached to the outside wall of each of the reactors for
temperature measurement and control.
Reactant and pretreatment gases, which included 10%
N2/CH4, O2, He, and H2, were all of UHP grade from
Matheson and were used without further puriﬁcation. Gas
ﬂows were regulated by mass ﬂow controllers. In a typical
experiment, the catalyst was ﬁrst heated in the ﬂow reac-
tor in a stream of He at 700◦C for 1 h. Before introducing
the 10% N2/CH4 reactant gas mixture into the reactor, the
catalyst was further heated in an O2 ﬂow at 700◦C for 0.5 h
and then ﬂushed in He for 1 h at the same temperature. The
10% N2 in the CH4 reactant was used as an inert internal
standard to enable accurate determinations of CH4 conver-
sions (typically <10%) and to allow quantitative evaluation
ofcokeformationduringthereactionfromcarbonmassbal-
ances. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by on-line gas
chromatography using a column containing 5% Bentone 34
on Chromosorb W-AW for separation of aromatic products
and a HayeSep D column for separation of COx and other
hydrocarbons. All studies were carried out at atmospheric
pressure, without diluting the reagents with additional
inert gas.
Catalyst Characterization
XPSandion-scatteringspectroscopy(ISS)spectra,which
were used to determine the abundance and chemical state
of surface components of the catalysts, were acquired using
a Perkin–Elmer (PHI) Model 5500 spectrometer. All spec-
tra were obtained using samples prepared in the form of
pressed wafers and treated in one of two ways: (i) “fresh”
samples were prepared by treatment in a separate quartz
reactor system in a stream of O2 at various desired temper-
atures; and (ii) “used” samples were prepared by treating
the fresh catalysts in 10–20% CH4/H2 and/or pure CH4 at
700◦C, duplicating the conditions employed in the catalytic
reaction experiments. The quartz reactor system used for
these treatments contained an O-ring-sealed port that al-
lowed in situ transfer of the ceramic holder containing the
treated sample into a stainless-steel vacuum transport ves-
sel (PHI Model 609217). The removable vessel was then
transferred to a similar port on the inlet system of the XPS
spectrometer, which was subsequently evacuated, allowing
the sample to be introduced into the UHV analysis chamber
of the instrument using magnetically coupled transfer rods
without exposure to the air. A typical XPS data acquisition
employed a pass energy of 29.35 eV, a step increment of
0.125 eV, and a Mg anode power of 400 W. All binding en-
ergies were referenced to the zeolitic Al2p line at 74.5 eV.
Near-surface compositions were calculated from peak ar-
eas using appropriate sensitivity factors. ISS spectra were
obtained using 3He+ ions at a scattering angle of 134.5◦and
∼1 kV accelerating potential. To avoid any charging ef-
fects of the insulating catalysts, which would distort the ion
energy spectra, the specimens were ﬂooded with thermal
electrons during ISS data acquisition.
Infrared spectra were obtained using a Perkin–Elmer
Model 2000 FT-IR spectrometer. Self-supporting wafers
having an optical density of 10–15 mg/cm2 were pressed
from the powdered catalysts. The wafers were mounted
on a fused quartz bracket that was placed in an IR cell
equipped with KBr windows and a heated region into which
the wafer could be moved for thermal treatment. The cata-
lyst samples used in the IR study were subjected to the same
350

pretreatments as those used in the XPS and ISS experi-
ments. Following the desired in situ pretreatment, spectra
were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with the sample
at room temperature. Corrections for variation in sample
wafer thickness were made for all the spectra.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Catalytic Results
In our previous studies (9, 10), it was shown that, follow-
ing an initial induction period, during which the CH4 reac-
tant reduces the original Mo6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C
anddepositionofcokeoccurs,abenzeneselectivityofabout
70% at a CH4 conversion of 8% could be sustained for 16 h
over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst at 700◦C. Because metal-
lic Mo0 and the Mo in Mo2C cannot be readily distinguished
in XPS spectra due to the similarity in Mo3d binding ener-
gies of these two species (22–24), it is necessary to use the
C1s peak of Mo2C to determine the Mo/C ratio and conﬁrm
the formation of Mo2C during the reaction. Under normal
reaction conditions, the presence of a large amount of coke
on the catalyst surface prevents unambiguous identiﬁcation
of Mo2C and the role of Mo2C in the reaction. Therefore, to
understand the origin of the induction period and conﬁrm
formation of Mo2C, it was necessary to form Mo2C in the
zeolite without signiﬁcant concomitant deposition of coke.
Based on the studies of Boudart and co-workers on the
formation of molybdenum carbides from MoO3 (25, 26), it
is possible to form Mo2C without signiﬁcant formation of
graphitic or coke-like carbon by treating MoO3 in a 20%
CH4/H2 ﬂow at 670◦C.
Figure 2 shows methane conversions and benzene selec-
tivities for the reaction of methane in the absence of gas-
phase oxygen at 700◦C and at a space velocity of 800 h−1
over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst pretreated under differ-
ent conditions. The solid data points depict typical results
obtained over a catalyst sample that had been pretreated in
O2 for 0.5 h and then in He for 0.5 h at 700◦C prior to initi-
ating the 10% N2/CH4 reactant ﬂow. The open data points
display the results obtained over a catalyst which had been
treated at 700◦C in a 200 ml/min ﬂow of 20% CH4/H2 for
12 h, followed by a ﬂow of 10% CH4/H2 at the same tem-
perature for 4 h. The conversion of CH4 to benzene was
conﬁrmed to be a catalytic process, rather than a merely
stoichiometric reduction of Mo ions, since the ratio of CH4
molecules reacted to total Mo atom content in the catalyst
was >100 over a 10-h period on stream. Under steady-state
conditions at 700◦C, the rate of CH4 conversion over the
2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst was ca. 1 µmol/g/s, equivalent to
0.0048 mol/mol Mo/s or 17 CH4/Mo/h.
Following an initial activation period during the ﬁrst 2 h
of reaction, a benzene selectivity of 60 to 65% at a CH4 con-
version of 4 to 8% was achieved over the sample calcined in
O2. (Both the CH4 conversions and the benzene selectivi-

ties shown in Fig. 2 are slightly lower than those we reported
previously (9, 10), primarily due to improved accuracy in
determining CH4 conversion levels resulting from the use of
a 10% N2 internal standard instead of the 1% N2 employed
in our earlier study.) During this induction period, particu-
larly during the ﬁrst 10 to 20 min, virtually no hydrocarbon
products were formed, and the principal gas-phase prod-
ucts resulting from CH4 conversion were H2, CO, CO2, and
H2O (see Fig. 3a). The total selectivity to gas-phase prod-
ucts was also low because signiﬁcant amounts of coke and
Mo2C were formed from CH4 during this initial period, ac-
counting for the remainder of the selectivity not shown in
Figs. 2 and 3. Following the initial induction period, how-
ever, the amount of coke that continued to form from CH4
reactant corresponded to ∼15% of the CH4 converted. The
selectivity to naphthalene attained a maximum of ∼16%
immediately following the initial activation period, but then
declined rapidly with increasing time on stream. Presum-
ably the gradual accumulation of coke in the zeolite chan-
nels decreased their effective diameter, thus increasingly
inhibiting the formation (or escape) of the thermodynami-
cally favored, but bulky, naphthalene molecules (10). Thus,
after a sufﬁciently long period of reaction, benzene and
a small amount of toluene were selectively produced as
the kinetically favored aromatic products. The selectivity
to C2–C3 hydrocarbons (which were mainly ethylene), al-
though always small compared to that of benzene, increased
continuously with increasing reaction time, as coke depo-
sition gradually deactivated the acidic sites in the zeolite
where the ethylene primary product undergoes secondary
reactions (10). In all cases, the original activity and selectiv-
ity behaviors of the catalyst, including the initial induction

period, could be completely restored by retreating the used
catalyst in O2 at 700◦C.
By contrast, the induction period was largely, although
notcompletely,eliminatedwhenthecatalystwaspretreated
intheCH4/H2gasmixture(opendatapointsinFigs.2and3).
In this case, signiﬁcant amounts of hydrocarbons, mainly
benzene and naphthalene, were produced even during the
ﬁrst few minutes of reaction. Only very small amounts of
CO2 and H2O were detected, and the amount of CO formed
(Fig. 3b) was much smaller than that observed over the cal-
cined sample that had not been prereduced (Fig. 3a). In
addition, the selectivity to naphthalene not only attained
a larger maximum value of ∼20% following the initial ac-
tivation period, but then also declined much more slowly
with increasing time on stream, in comparison to that ob-
served over the unreduced catalyst (Fig. 3a). Presumably, a
decrease in the concentration of acidic sites after the pre-
treatment in CH4/H2 may suppress the deposition of coke
in the zeolite channels so that the formation of naphthalene
becomes less inhibited. Although the rate of deactivation of
the prereduced catalyst also appears to be somewhat slower
than that of the calcined sample, the overall catalytic per-
formances, following the initial induction period, are very
similar for both samples. These results, together with the
XPS data to be described below, indicate that formation
of Mo2C during the CH4/H2 pretreatment is virtually com-
plete, and suggest that the induction period observed for the
calcined catalyst is due to the formation of Mo2C, which is
the active species for the activation of methane.
The fact that the extended pretreatment at 700◦C in
CH4/H2 did not completely eliminate the induction period
observed with the calcined catalyst indicates that the reduc-
tion of Mo, although necessary, is not solely responsible for
the observed induction period (9, 10). Additional modiﬁ-
cation of the Mo-containing sites, possibly involving partial
deactivation by coke deposition on Mo2C, may be required
to create sites that selectively convert CH4 to higher hydro-
carbon products. The deposition of carbonaceous materials
on Mo2C during the induction period is evidenced by the
decreased intensity of the Mo3d XPS bands after a catalyst
had been exposed to CH4 reactant for 2 h (see below). It is
possible that the fresh carbidic surface, formed by treating
Mo/ZSM-5 in a CH4/H2 gas mixture, is efﬁcient for methane
activation, but may be too reactive for the formation and/or
desorption of the ethylene primary product.
The beneﬁcial effects of carbonaceous deposits have
been observed previously for various reactions over metal
carbide catalysts and have been attributed to a site-blocking
effect (27–29) and/or electronic modiﬁcation of the active
surface as a result of the metal–carbon bond formation
(29, 30). Wang and Tysoe (29) carried out an investigation
of ethylene hydrogenation over metallic molybdenum and
found that the reaction was facilitated both by the forma-
tion of molybdenum carbide and by the deposit of carbona-
ceous material. They suggested that part of the role of the
carbonaceous deposit was to block extremely active sites
to prevent further hydrocarbon decomposition. In a study
of selective activation of C–H and C=
=C bonds on metal
carbides, Chen (30) observed that the interaction between
1,3-butadiene and a vanadium carbide surface is sufﬁciently
strong that decomposition of 1,3-butadiene occurred on the
carbide surface with a C/V ratio of 1.
The small remaining induction period after prereduction
in CH4/H2 might also be attributed to incomplete reduc-
tion of molybdenum oxides to Mo2C (see below). Indeed,
XPS and ISS experiments conﬁrm that the surface oxygen
concentration on an unsupported Mo2C sample prepared
from MoO3 can be as high as 1 to 3%, even after it had been
reduced in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700◦C for 16 h. How-
ever, in a separate experiment, it was observed that when
methane was replaced by an equivalent amount of ethylene
as the reactant gas after the original reaction had reached
steady state, another induction period for the formation of
benzene occurred. This second induction period reﬂects the
fact that ethylene decomposes on the carbidic surface more
readily than does methane, and that further coke decom-
position occurs from ethylene on the already coked Mo2C
surface. However, the formation of CO, indicative of MoOx
reduction, did not increase after methane reactant was re-
placed by ethylene. These results suggest, therefore, that
352

incomplete reduction of molybdenum oxides is not respon-
sible for the “residual” induction period.
Chemical States of Mo in the Catalysts
Since metallic Mo0 and the Mo in Mo2C cannot be readily
distinguished in XPS spectra due to the similarity in Mo3d
binding energies of these two species (29–31), it is necessary
to use the C1s band of Mo2C to determine the Mo/C ratio
of the carbide, if it is formed during the reaction. Figures 4
and 5 show XPS spectra of the 2% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in
the C1s and Mo3d regions, respectively. An unsupported
molybdenum carbide sample, prepared by treating MoO3
in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700◦C for 16 h, is included for
a comparison. (The formation of bulk molybdenum car-
bide, in the form of β-Mo2C, from pure MoO3 as the sole
product following this treatment was conﬁrmed by separate
powder XRD measurements.) The carbided zeolite sample
was similarly prepared by treating the 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5
catalyst in a 200 ml/min ﬂow of 20% CH4/H2 for 12 h at
700◦C, followed by 10% CH4/H2 at the same temperature
for 4 h. Table 1 provides a comparison of the various C1s
and Mo3d binding energies observed in the present study
to those reported by previous investigators.
As shown in Fig. 4a, only a small amount of graphitic car-
bon (characterized by the C1s peak at 284.6 eV) remains on
the surface of the catalyst after calcination in O2 at 700◦C

for 0.5 h. Exposure of the sample to CH4 at the same tem-
perature for 2 h results in the formation of a large amount of
coke, giving rise to the intense peak at 283.5 eV, which ob-
scures the Mo2C that is also formed. (The lower C1s binding
energy of this carbonaceous material, compared to that of
graphitic carbon, suggests that it may be a hydrogen-poor
sp-type of “pregraphitic” carbon.) However, coke forma-
tion is largely suppressed when the catalyst is reduced in a
CH4/H2 mixture (Fig. 4c and Table 2), allowing a shoulder to
become evident at 282.7 eV, which is consistent with the for-
mation of Mo2C (Fig. 4d). This result clearly demonstrates
that molybdenum carbide is formed during pretreatment
in the CH4/H2 gas mixture. Since the driving force for the
formation of carbide from the oxide precursor increases as
the concentration of methane in the gas mixture increases
(22), it is reasonable to expect that molybdenum carbide
is also formed under typical reaction conditions, i.e., in the
presence of pure CH4 reactant.
Formation of molybdenum carbide during the reaction
of CH4 is further supported by XPS spectra in the Mo3d re-
gion. As shown in Fig. 5, the molybdenum species present in
the freshly calcined catalyst, based on the observed Mo3d
binding energies, is mainly Mo6+ (10, 31, 36). After the sam-
ple was exposed to methane at 700◦C for 2 h, which corre-
sponds to the steady state achieved for the catalytic reac-
tion (Fig. 2), the original Mo6+ ions were almost completely
reduced. In addition, however, the overall intensity of all

of the Mo3d bands gradually decreased as the reduction
time increased to 2 h (10). This decrease in intensity of the
Mo3d bands can be ascribed to the deposition of carbona-
ceous material (i.e., coke) on the catalyst, as evidenced by
the corresponding XPS spectra in the C1s region, shown
in Fig. 4b. A similar reduction of Mo6+ occurred when the
freshly calcined 2% Mo/ZSM-5 was treated in a ﬂow of
20% CH4/H2 for 12 h, followed by 10% CH4/H2 at 700◦C for
4 h. In this case, however, the intensity of the Mo3d bands
remained essentially the same as before reduction (Fig. 5c),
which is consistent with the fact that only a small amount
of coke is formed during such a pretreatment (Fig. 4c and
Table 2). The Mo3d5/2 binding energy of 227.9 eV of the
samples, pretreated either in the CH4 or in the CH4/H2 gas
mixture, is consistent with that of pure Mo2C (Fig. 5d), as
reported previously (10, 22–24).
The near-surface compositions of the catalyst, following
different pretreatments, are summarized in Table 2. The
relative amounts of the various carbon and molybdenum
species were obtained by deconvolution of the C1s and
Mo3d bands (Figs. 4 and 5), using the following assump-
tions: (i) Different full widths at half maximum (FWHM)
were used for the same peak in the supported vs. the unsup-
ported samples, due to different charging effects; however,
the same FWHM was assumed for all peaks of the same
sample. FWHM values of 1.1 and 2.3 eV were employed in
the deconvolution of the C1s bands of the pure Mo2C sam-
ple and the 2% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, respectively. For the
Mo3d bands, FWHM values of 1.0 and 2.2 eV were used
for the pure Mo2C sample and the 2% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst,
respectively. (ii) Based on the results of the present study
and those of previous investigators (8, 22, 23, 31, 32, 34),
the Mo3d5/2 and 3d3/2 binding energies were assumed to
be 233.1 and 236.3 eV for Mo6+; 231.4 and 234.6 eV for
Mo5+; 229.3 and 232.5 eV for Mo4+; and 227.9 and 231.1 eV
for Mo2C. The C1s binding energies were those shown in
Table 1, viz., 284.6 eV for graphitic carbon, 283.5 eV for
coke-like carbon, and 282.7 eV for carbidic carbon (8, 22,
33, 35).
Deconvolution of the Mo3d bands conﬁrmed that ∼90%
of the molybdenum ions in the original oxidized catalyst
(Fig. 5a) were Mo6+, with the remaining 10% occurring as
Mo5+, probably resulting from photoreduction of the sam-
ple during X-ray irradiation in the spectrometer. After the
sample was exposed to methane at 700◦C for 2 h (Fig. 5b),
65% of the molybdenum species had been converted to
Mo2C. The remaining molybdenum was present as Mo4+
(20%) and Mo5+ (10%). Although a small amount of Mo6+
(<5%) may also have still been present after only 2 h of
CH4 reaction, it disappeared completely after 10 h of reac-
tion time. Similar deconvolution results were obtained for
the sample pretreated in the CH4/H2 gas mixture (Fig. 5c).
The relative concentrations of Mo2C, Mo4+, and Mo5+ in
this case were found to be 75, 20, and 5%, respectively.
Based on the absolute near-surface concentrations of car-
bidic C and of Mo in the form of Mo2C, the C/Mo ratio was
determined to be 0.60, which is close to the stoichiometric
value for Mo2C. Using the same procedure, a C/Mo ratio of
0.59 was found for the unsupported Mo2C sample.
These results clearly demonstrate that Mo2C, and not
metallic molybdenum, is formed under CH4 reaction con-
ditions at 700◦C and, furthermore, that the carbide is most
likely the active species for the activation of methane and
formation of ethylene as the primary reaction intermedi-
ate (10). In fact, as discussed above, metallic Mo, if present,

would be catalytically inferior to carbidic Mo for the activa-
tion of C–H bonds and formation of ethylene. In addition,
it has been observed in our previous study that addition of
80TorrofCO2totheCH4feed,afterhavingattainedsteady-
state conditions, causes an immediate cessation of benzene
production and extensive simultaneous reoxidation of Mo,
resulting in complete removal of the Mo2C species and
concomitant formation of higher oxidation states including
Mo6+, Mo5+, and Mo4+. A similar effect on the formation of
benzene and reoxidation of Mo2C was also observed when
an equivalent amount of H2O was added (10). It may be
concluded, therefore, that neither Mo6+ ions nor partially
reduced Mo ions are active molybdenum species.
Solymosi and co-workers reported poor performance for
methane conversion over both unsupported Mo2C (hav-
ing a surface area of 1.1 m2/g) and a physical mixture of
1.4 wt% Mo2C and ZSM-5 (6). The authors also examined
the effect of reoxidation of the 1.4% Mo2C/ZSM-5 mix-
ture on its behavior for methane conversion and forma-
tion of benzene. It was observed that partially (15 to 50%)
oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 displayed much better catalytic be-
havior than that observed for the original Mo2C/ZSM-5
sample. It was concluded that Mo2C–MoO2 with an oxygen
deﬁciency may be the active species for methane activation
and formation of ethylene. It should be pointed out that an
induction period always occurred for the formation of ben-
zene over these partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 samples,
and that the amount of oxygen consumed (as CO, CO2, and
H2O) during the induction period was essentially identi-
cal to that used for the oxidation of Mo2C before reaction.
This observation indicates that the formation of benzene
reaches a maximum (or steady state) only after virtually
all of the Mo oxides are completely reduced, although the
conversion of methane reaches a maximum over a partially
oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 sample. These results, therefore, are
consistent with our postulate that the carbide, Mo2C, rather
than the oxygen-deﬁcient MoO2 suggested by the above au-
thors, is the active species for methane conversion to ben-
zene. In their most recent studies, however, Solymosi and
co-workers (7, 8) also concluded that Mo2C is the princi-
pal species involved in the initial activation of CH4. The
enhanced performance of the Mo2C/ZSM-5 sample after
partial oxidation observed in their earlier studies may have
resulted from improved dispersion of Mo during the oxygen
pretreatment.
Distribution of Mo in ZSM-5 Zeolite
The phenomenon of spreading and/or dispersion of Mo
oxides on various oxide supports, particularly alumina,
silica, and zeolites, has been intensively studied recently
(37–39). It has been proposed, for example, that Mo species,
deposited by conventional wet impregnation using aqueous
ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) solution, are present
inside the channels of a Mo/NaY zeolite. However, infor-

ISS spectra of 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst calcined at different
temperatures.
mation concerning the distribution of Mo in ZSM-5 zeo-
lite is scarce and still largely speculative (11, 12, 19, 21). In
the present study, the distribution of Mo in the Mo/ZSM-5
catalyst was characterized using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR tech-
niques.
ISS is a useful method for analyzing the chemical compo-
sition of the catalyst surface because of its sensitivity to the
outermost atomic layer. Figure 6 shows ISS spectra of the
2% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst after calcination at different tem-
peratures in O2. (Similar results were obtained when the
sample was heated under a ﬂow of He at the same temper-
atures). Si and Al are indistinguishable by the ISS technique
when using 3He+ ions, particularly when the Si/Al ratio is
large, as in the case of ZSM-5. From Fig. 6 it can be observed
that C, O, Si(+Al), and Mo are all present on the external
surface of the catalyst calcined at the different tempera-
tures. The C peak is not well resolved at the E/E0 ratio of
0.419 due to its low sensitivity.
Only a very small Mo peak was detected for the sam-
ple dried at 130◦C for 5 h. Moreover, the intensity of the
peak was almost independent of the sputtering time for
the sample after heating at this low temperature, although
a slight increase in the Mo peak intensity was observed
after a long sputtering period, presumably due to redistri-
bution/adsorption of the sputtered Mo species. XPS spec-
tra show that the near-surface concentration of Mo in the
2% Mo/ZSM-5 that was dried at 130◦C was only 0.19 at.%.
This value is much smaller than 0.42 at.%, which would
be the near-surface concentration of the Mo if it were uni-
formly distributed. In addition, XRD results showed no
detectable crystalline phase other than that of the zeolite
METHANE CONVERSION TO BENZENE OVER Mo/ZSM-5

support. For a sample having a Mo loading of only 2 wt%
in ZSM-5 zeolite, a crystalline Mo-containing phase, if
present, would be difﬁcult to detect by XRD if the crys-
tallite sizes were smaller than ca. 50 ˚
A. Since the mean free
path of Mo3d photoelectrons is 16–17 ˚
A (40), these results
suggest that Mo species in the dried sample are present as
small (30–50 ˚
A) crystallites of AHM on the external surface
of the zeolite. This conclusion is further supported by the
fact that the surface concentration of Mo indicated by the
ISS spectra did not change after sputtering for 0.5 h with
4 keV Ar+ ions, which would have exposed more Mo had
some been present within the zeolite channels in addition
to that on the external surface.
The intensity of the Mo ISS peak increased consider-
ably, relative to that of Si(Al), after calcination in O2 at
500◦C for 4 h (Fig. 6). When the sample was treated in
O2 at 700◦C for an additional 0.5 h, the relative intensity
of the Mo peak increased even further. Since the 2 wt%
Mo loading is equivalent to about two to three monolayers
on the ZSM-5 external surface, the intensity of the Si(Al)
peak would be expected to decrease to essentially zero if
the Mo were completely and uniformly distributed on the
ZSM-5 surface. As shown in Fig. 6, however, the relative
intensity of the Si(Al) peak did not decrease signiﬁcantly
with increasing treatment temperature, although the inten-
sity of the Mo peak increased markedly after calcination at
500 and, particularly, 700◦C, suggesting that the Mo species
spread over the surface, but did not become uniformly dis-
persed on the external surface of the zeolite. It appears that
the dispersion of molybdenum oxide species on the surface
of ZSM-5 may occur slowly and/or may be restricted to
a short distance. Kn¨
ozinger and co-workers (41) observed
that MoO3 dispersed extensively on Al2O3 and TiO2, but
not on SiO2, after similar thermal treatment.
Additional characterization by ISS and FT-IR indicates
thatpartoftheMomayalsodiffuseintothezeolitechannels
during calcination at high temperatures. Figure 7, for exam-
ple, shows the effect of 4 keV Ar+ ion sputtering on the ISS
spectra of the 2% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst calcined at 700◦C for
0.5 h. (In these experiments, the Ar+ ion beam was rastered
over a 5 × 5-mm area during sputtering to ensure that the
He+ ions collected in the subsequent ISS spectra came only
from the area sputtered.) The variation of the Mo/Si peak
intensity ratio with sputtering time allows one to obtain in-
formation about the distribution of Mo in the channels of
the ZSM-5. As the sputtering time increased, the C peak
intensity decreased, and the Si(Al) peak correspondingly
increased, suggesting that fresh surface was being exposed.
The intensity of the Mo peak gradually decreased, but did
not vanish, even after sputtering for as long as 2 h. Since
no Mo is present in the form of large crystallites on the ex-
ternal surface of the ZSM-5 after calcination at 700◦C, as
discussed above, it is most likely that the small Mo peak
that remains after extensive sputtering is due to Mo species

that are inside the channels of the zeolite, rather than from
a residue of surface Mo. These results clearly indicate that
some Mo does diffuse into the channels of ZSM-5 during
calcination at 700◦C.
More direct information about the dispersion of Mo on
ZSM-5 was obtained from FT-IR experiments in which the
effects of Mo impregnation on the O–H stretching modes
of the zeolite were examined. Figure 8 shows IR spectra of
the pure H-ZSM-5 starting material and of 2% Mo/ZSM-5
in the region of the zeolitic O–H stretching modes, after
thermal treatment in ﬂowing He at 700◦C for the indicated
times. All of the spectra were recorded after quenching the
treated sample in He to room temperature.
As shown in Fig. 8a, pure H-ZSM-5 contains three prin-
cipal types of hydroxyl groups. One of these, having a vi-
brational frequency of 3611 cm−1, is associated with the
Brønsted acidity of the zeolite (42–44). The intensity of
this band correlates with the aluminum content of the ze-
olite (43) and with the extent of proton exchange (44). A
second hydroxyl group, having a stretching frequency at
3747 cm−1, has been attributed to silanol groups that ter-
minate the zeolite lattice. i.e., those on the external surface
(42, 43). The weak band at about 3670 cm−1 has been at-
tributed to hydroxyl groups that are associated with extra
framework aluminum species (45). A separate 27Al NMR
experiment conﬁrmed the presence of a signiﬁcant amount
of extra framework aluminum in this H-ZSM-5 zeolite.
It is apparent that all three types of OH groups in
H-ZSM-5 are thermally stable during treatment in ﬂow-
ing He at 700◦C. The intensities of the various OH bands

were virtually unchanged, even after treatment at this tem-
perature for 12 h. It should be mentioned that the overall
intensities of the various hydroxyl bands reached a max-
imum after treatment in ﬂowing He at 500 to 600◦C and
did not decrease signiﬁcantly following treatment at 700◦C.
Dehydroxylation of the Brønsted OH groups at 3611 cm−1
becomes signiﬁcant only after heating at 900◦C; even at this
temperature, however, hydroxyl removal is not complete
after heating the sample for 9 h. Dehydroxylation of the
terminal surface silanol groups does not occur appreciably,
even after heating the sample at 900◦C for many hours.
Infrared spectra obtained after heating the 2% Mo/
ZSM-5 sample in ﬂowing He at 700◦C for various times, are
shown in Fig. 8b. Comparison of these spectra with those
in Fig. 8a obtained after comparable treatment times re-
veals that, although the amounts of all three types of OH
groups decreased following Mo impregnation, the relative
extent of the decrease differed markedly for the various OH
species. The weak band at 3670 cm−1, for example, due to
OH groups on extra framework aluminum, disappeared al-
most completely upon Mo impregnation. Similarly, the con-
centration of OH groups associated with terminal silanol
species (3747 cm−1) decreased to a signiﬁcantly greater
extent than did that of the Brønsted acidic OH groups
(3611 cm−1) located inside the zeolite channels. Quantita-
tive analysis of the spectra obtained after a 0.5-h treatment
at 700◦C indicates that impregnation with 2 wt% Mo caused
the intensity of the silanol OH band to decrease to ∼30%
of that observed for the pure HZSM-5, while the Brønsted
hydroxyl groups, by contrast, retained ∼70% of the inten-
sity observed for the unimpregnated HZSM-5. It should be
noted that the intensity of the Brønsted hydroxyl band did
not decrease at all when the 2% Mo/ZSM-5 was heated
at only 400◦C for 1 h, while the silanol groups lost ∼50%
of their intensity following treatment at this temperature.
These observations indicate that impregnated Mo remains
primarily on the external surface of the zeolite at treatment
temperatures of ≤400◦C, and that some of the Mo diffuses
into the channels of the zeolite after calcination at 700◦C
for 0.5 h. These results also suggest that the ISS signal ob-
served for Mo in Fig. 7 after Ar+ sputtering is primarily due
to Mo within the channels of the zeolite.
As shown in Fig. 8b, as the time of calcination was in-
creased, the Mo species continued spreading on the exter-
nalsurface,whilesimultaneouslydiffusingintothechannels
of the ZSM-5. After 9 h of treatment at 700◦C, for exam-
ple, the intensities of both the silanol and the Brønsted
hydroxyl bands decreased an additional 50% from the
amounts present after only 0.5 h of treatment at this tem-
perature. Moreover, the rates of spreading and/or diffusion
of the Mo6+ species of the oxide depend strongly on the cal-
cination atmosphere. The spectrum of the hydroxyl groups
in a 2% Mo/ZSM-5 sample after calcination in air at only
500◦C for 4 h is similar to that obtained for a sample cal-
cined at 700◦C in dry O2 or in He for the same length of
time, suggesting that moisture in the air signiﬁcantly pro-
motes the diffusion process. A similar effect of moisture
on the dispersion of Mo has been reported previously to
occur for Mo/Al2O3, but not for Mo/SiO2 (41). It should
be noted that under CH4 reaction conditions, most of the
molybdenum oxide has already been converted into Mo2C,
and, as a result, the diffusion process is terminated. We
have observed, for example, that the band intensities of
both principal types of hydroxyl groups on the Mo/ZSM-5
catalyst following initial calcination at 700◦C remain essen-
tially unchanged after subsequent exposure to a CH4/H2
gas mixture at 700◦C.
The decrease in intensities of the three types of O–H
stretching bands at 3747, 3611, and 3670 cm−1 indicates
that the impregnated Mo species are evidently located in
the vicinity of these hydroxyl groups. Thus, the terminal
zeolitic silanol groups, although essentially nonacidic, may
act like Al–OH species on the surface of Al2O3, which have
been proposed to react with Mo7O6−
24 anionic species dur-
ing the preparation of Mo/Al2O3 catalysts (46, 47). It ap-
pears, therefore, that silanol groups on H-ZSM-5 are re-
placed by Mo species on the external surface of the zeolite,
since a broadening and/or red-shift of the silanol band at
3747 cm−1, but not an overall decrease in intensity, would be
expected if only a strong interaction and not a replacement
occurred between the Mo species and the silanol groups. In
addition, the ISS results in Fig. 6 conﬁrm that a small part
METHANE CONVERSION TO BENZENE OVER Mo/ZSM-5
357
of the Si was covered with Mo. Similarly, Mo species inside
the channels of ZSM-5 may react with the Al3+ (both lattice
and extra framework), and an extraction of Al cations from
the zeolite framework could occur (48, 49), in addition to
an exchange with H+ ions (11).
Based solely on the observed intensity changes of the
ν(OH) IR bands, no deﬁnitive conclusion can be drawn
about the distribution of molybdenum in the ZSM-5 zeolite
because the extinction coefﬁcients of the different types of
hydroxyl groups are not known. However, a combination
of FT-IR and XPS/ISS measurements may allow such in-
formation to be obtained. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, Mo
is highly enriched on the external surface of the zeolite, al-
though the absolute amount of Mo within the channels is
not known. It would be expected that more Mo may dif-
fuse into the channels of the zeolite when the Mo loading is
higher, especially for a Mo/ZSM-5 sample calcined at high
temperatures, e.g., ≥700◦C, for many hours. As a result,
the number of acid sites would decrease signiﬁcantly. We
have previously shown (9, 10) that ethylene, the primary
product formed from CH4 reactant on the surface of coke-
modiﬁed Mo2C, is converted into benzene and other aro-
matics on such acid sites within the channels of the ZSM-5
zeolite. The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites
in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high
benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since
the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored
(10). It is not surprising, therefore, that a Mo/ZSM-5 cata-
lyst with a high Mo loading, e.g., ≥5 wt%, displayed both a
low methane conversion and poor benzene selectivity (12,
14), except when the catalyst was calcined at a lower tem-
perature (14).
CONCLUSIONS
The distribution and the chemical states of Mo in a 2 wt%
Mo/ZSM-5, before and after calcination at different tem-
peratures, were investigated using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR
techniques, and correlated with kinetic results for the con-
version of methane to benzene. Impregnated molybdenum
in the calcined catalyst is initially present as MoO3, pri-
marily in the form of small crystallites on the external sur-
face of the ZSM-5 zeolite. After treatment at ≤400◦C, rel-
atively little Mo is present in the channels of ZSM-5, and
the acidity of the zeolite is not modiﬁed. After calcination
at 500◦C in O2, the Mo becomes highly dispersed on the
external surface of the zeolite, and part of it diffuses into
the channels, causing a decrease in acidity. The Mo distri-
bution, however, is not uniform on the external surface of
the zeolite. Although calcination of the catalyst at 700◦C for
0.5 h results in improved dispersion of Mo over the exter-
nal surface and, possibly, inside the channels of the zeolite,
uniform monolayer coverage of Mo on the external surface
does not occur. The concentration of Mo within the chan-
nels of the zeolite increases as the temperature and time of
calcination increases. The presence of moisture during the
calcination may signiﬁcantly promote diffusion of Mo into
the channels, especially at higher temperatures.
Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to
CH4/H2 at 700◦C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,
rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species
are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches
steady state, but part of the Mo (20–30%) remains present
as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the cata-
lyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700◦C for many hours.
The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of
the initial activation period for the production of benzene,
indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active
centers for the activation of methane. This assumption is
supported by the inhibiting effect of CO2 or moisture on the
formation of benzene (10). Since preformation of Mo2C on
the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely
eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean
surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydro-
carbons and, thus, that a coke-modiﬁed Mo2C surface may
be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as
the reaction intermediate.
