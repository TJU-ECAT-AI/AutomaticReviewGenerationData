INTRODUCTION
Direct conversion of natural gas to more valuable compounds, such as liquid hydrocarbons, is a worldwide intriguing and challenging project. Partial oxidation of methane can be carried out in a wide range of temperatures.
However, it is very difficult to obtain satisfactory selectivity and yield of aimed products because of the complete oxidation of methane to COx.
Methane conversion under non-oxidizing conditions is thermodynamically unfavorable although high selectivity can be obtained. In 1993, the selective conversion of methane to benzene over Mo-containing zeolites at 973 K has been reported and a carbenium ion mechanism for methane activation over bifunctional Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst has been suggested [1]. This makes it possible that methane can be transformed to benzene at a temperature about 500 K lower than that of methane pyrolysis for obtaining similar benzene yield [2]. More recently, this reaction is repeated over Mo-W/HZSM-5 bimetallic catalyst and the authors suggest that Mo=CH2 metal carbene-like species may be formed in the process of methane activation [3]. Also, the reaction has been performed in different reactors under different reaction conditions with the characterization of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts [4]. Low reaction temperature is decisive for the possible application of the reaction to industrial production as an extension of the Cyclar process. On the other hand, Han et al. recently reported [5] the direct partial oxidation of methane to C5+ hydrocarbons over HZSM-5 catalyst when a C3 additive (propane or propene) is present in the feed or sorbed heavy hydrocarbons are present on the partially coked HZSM-5 catalyst. They also discovered that the reaction of pure CH4 to C2+ and C5+ products persisted when the C3 additive was removed from the feed after C5+ hydrocarbon production had begun. In the same way, Han et al. [6] suggested two possible mechanisms for the reaction of methane partial oxidation to C+ hydrocarbons over HZSM-5 catalyst. They point out that a C3 additive in the feed or sorbed heavy hydrocarbons on the partially coked HZSM-5 catalyst initiate the conversion of methane to C5+ hydrocarbons by MTG mechanism. In the present paper, the means for direct conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions at lower temperature of 773-873K are reported. Initiation is due to C2+ additives in the feed and some special coke on Mo-containing ZSM-5 catalysts. A reaction mechanism and a product phase transformation process for the methane conversion are suggested.

EXPERIMENTAL
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia. Samples were dried at 383 K for 4 h and calcined at 773 K for 4 h, finally they were pressed, crushed and sorted into sizes of 10-30 mesh. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR and BET measurements. Catalytic reactions were carried out with 2 g catalyst samples placed in a stainless steel reactor with an inner diameter of 10 ram. Products were withdrawn periodically from the outlet of the reactor and analyzed by on-line gas chromatography with a 2 m long Porapak column and detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector. Conversion and selectivity were calculated on the carbon number basis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Some physical and chemical characteristics of the catalyst used in this work are listed in Table 1. The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst.

Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed. Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained. Thus,the reaction can be initiated by C2+ higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed.
Furthermore, aromatic product distribution is also controlled by the reaction temperature. High benzene selectivity can be obtained at the high temperature of 873 K but toluene is the leading product at lower temperature of 773 K. 104 PIERELLA et al.: CONVERSION Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2.

100 F/W = 1440 mL/g h, P = 200 kPa Therefore, the reaction of pure methane aromatization under non-oxidizing 9 conditions over Mo-containmg ZSM-5 catalysts may be initiated by the coke deposited on the catalysts at the low temperature of 873 K.
We suggested [7] that natural gas containing some higher hydrocarbons is converted to aromatics by the reaction mechanism shown in the following schemes: C2+ Hydrocarbons + Mo/HZSM-5 , Cz+ Carbenium ions (1) CH4 + C2+ Carbenium ions , Aromatics (2) C2+ Carbenium ions , Coke (3) CH4 + Coke , Aromatics (4) In this way, C2 + carbenium ions (eq. 1) would be more easily formed than Cl carbenium ions. Moreover, Mo would act as hydride acceptor more reactive toward C2+ than C1 hydrocarbons. Thus the conversion of natural gas to aromatics may be initiated at lower temperature than that for pure methane conversion.
We suggested that pure methane is transformed to aromatics over Mo- containing ZSM-5 catalysts in the following schemes: PIERELLA et al.: CONVERSION 105 CH4 + Mo/HZSM-5 '

,aromatics (8) Mo=CH2 ,coke (9) CH4+ Coke + Mo/HZSM-5 aromatics (10) The effect of the coke deposited over the catalyst on the transformation of pure methane is illustrated in Table 3.
The partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/I-IZSM-5 catalysts are obtained after being on stream of methane at 973 K for 6 h. Although carbonization of the catalysts on methane stream can be performed at the temperature of 873 K, the coked catalysts at 873 K exhibit almost no activity for pure methane conversion.
Therefore, only some special coke formed under certain coking conditions may be converted to aromatics with pure methane at a temperature as low as 873 K.

a Methane purity = 99.995%, F/W = 1440 mL/g h, P = 200 kPa. b According to ref. [1] c Coking temperature = 973 K, T.O.S. = 6 h Coke or its precursor formed on the catalysts may act as an initiator for pure methane conversion, which have the same effect as the Cz+ additive in the feed (eq. 4). Therefore, pure methane can be converted to aromatics over partially coked catalysts at lower temperatures than over fresh ones (eq. 10). On the other 106
PIERELLA
et al.: CONVERSION hand, since the coke was in a different phase from that of methane and products (aromatics), the phase transformation process takes place during the methane aromatization process. The phase transformation process can be described as follows: CH4(gas phase) , coke(solid phase ) ,aromatics (gas phase) Thus, a high methane conversion is obtained at lower temperature without thermodynamic limitation.
CONCLUSIONS
Methane can be effectively converted to aromatics at a low temperature of 773-873 K when C2+ mixtures in the feed or some special coke over Mo/HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is present. The results of methane conversion at lower temperature obtained with coked catalyst may be attributed to a product phase transformation process for methane conversion. 9
