1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the unusual localization of zinc cations in MFI zeolites modified by different preparation methods, which can affect catalytic properties. The complete substitution of protons by zinc ions at high Si/Al ratios leads to the formation of sites with partially compensated positive charges, resulting in high chemical activity and specific catalytic and adsorption properties. This could potentially influence the efficiency of alkane transformations in industrial processes.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，如何影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，以及哪些因素对它们的工业意义有贡献。然而，它确实讨论了锌阳离子在通过不同制备方法改性的MFI沸石中的异常定位，这可能会影响催化性能。在高Si/Al比下，质子被锌离子完全取代，形成了部分补偿正电荷的位点，导致高化学活性和特定的催化和吸附性能。这可能会影响工业过程中烷烃转化的效率。
