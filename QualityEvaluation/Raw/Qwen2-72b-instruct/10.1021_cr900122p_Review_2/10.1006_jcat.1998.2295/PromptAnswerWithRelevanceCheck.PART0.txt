1.The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure.

1.在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，支撑型钒氧化物的结构和催化行为受支撑物类型（Al2O3，SiO2，HfO2，TiO2和ZrO2）和钒表面密度的影响。在Al2O3，HfO2，TiO2和ZrO2上，表面密度低于7 VOx/nm2时，钒氧化物以高度分散的物种存在，但在SiO2上则以大V2O5晶体存在。随着VOx表面密度的增加，表面结构从孤立的单钒酸盐演变为聚钒酸盐域和V2O5晶体。聚钒酸盐在ZrO2和TiO2上的表面密度低于Al2O3和HfO2。随着所有支撑物上VOx域的增大，VOx表面密度增加，UV-可见边缘能量降低。随着VOx表面密度的增加，初始丙烯选择性增加，因为单钒酸盐物种和暴露的支撑物位点，这些位点有利于主要的燃烧途径，浓度降低。每V-原子的氧化脱氢速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。与支撑物的相互作用决定了在给定表面密度下存在的VOx结构类型，但在考虑到VOx结构的差异时，周转率并不依赖于支撑物的身份。在聚钒酸盐物种和在大块V2O5上的表面VOx位点上，氧化脱氢周转率是相似的。形成丙烯的氧化脱氢的相对速率和丙烯的二次氧化为COx并不依赖于支撑物的身份或VOx表面密度或结构。
