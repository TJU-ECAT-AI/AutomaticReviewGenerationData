1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的机制和效率有重大影响。通过升华将Ga、Fe和Zn等金属引入HZSM-5的空腔中，会形成各种活性物种，包括像(GaO)+和(HOFeOFeOH)2+这样的氧离子，这些物种通过H2和CO的温度程序还原，以及在二核Fe3+离子的情况下，通过ESR光谱学来识别。这些物种对催化剂的酸性有贡献，Lewis酸位与Brnsted酸位的比例按HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5的顺序增加。这些活性物种的存在和由此产生的酸性对于烷烃转化的效率至关重要。这些催化剂的工业重要性归因于它们能够催化MTG过程、从甲醇制造烯烃和轻烷烃的芳构化等反应，这些反应在石化工业中非常重要。
