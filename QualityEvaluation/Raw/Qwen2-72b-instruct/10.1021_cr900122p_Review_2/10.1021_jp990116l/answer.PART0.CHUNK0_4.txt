1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的机制和效率有重大影响。通过升华将Ga、Fe和Zn等金属引入HZSM-5的空腔中，会形成各种活性物种，包括二核Fe3+离子、(GaO)+离子和Zn2+阳离子，这些阳离子可以补偿两个Al中心四面体的电荷，或者附着在一个硅醇基团或ZnOH和一个Al中心四面体上。这些物种对催化剂的酸性有贡献，Lewis与Brnsted位点的比例按HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5的顺序增加。这些Lewis位点的强度也按Al > Ga > Zn > Fe的顺序增加。这些活性物种的存在和由此产生的酸性对于氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中烷烃转化的效率至关重要。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够催化烷烃转化为更有价值的产品，如烯烃和芳烃，这些产品在石化工业中是必不可少的。
