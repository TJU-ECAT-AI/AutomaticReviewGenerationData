1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，有重大影响。通过升华将Ga、Fe和Zn等金属引入HZSM-5沸石中，会形成强Lewis酸位点，并再生Brnsted酸位点，这些酸位点的强度取决于金属的种类。这些酸位点的存在影响了烷烃转化的催化活性和选择性。反应条件，如温度和还原或氧化气氛的存在，也会影响活性物种的性质，从而影响催化性能。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够催化MTG过程、从甲醇制造烯烃和轻烷烃的芳构化等反应，这些反应在石油化工行业中至关重要。
