1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，有重大影响。通过升华将Ga、Fe和Zn等金属引入HZSM-5沸石，会形成强Lewis酸位点，并再生Brnsted酸位点，这对催化活性至关重要。这些酸位点的强度和密度，以及金属物种的稳定性和还原性，在选择性和烷烃转化中起着关键作用。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够催化MTG过程、从甲醇制造烯烃和轻烷烃的芳构化等反应，这些反应对石化工业至关重要。
