1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，有着重大影响。通过升华将Ga、Fe和Zn等金属引入HZSM-5的空腔中，会形成强Lewis酸位点，并再生Brnsted酸位点，这对催化活性至关重要。这些酸位点的强度和密度，以及金属离子在不同配位环境中的存在，对烷烃的选择性和转化起着关键作用。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够在温和条件下催化反应，减少能耗，提高产品产量，使其在大规模生产过程中具有经济可行性。
