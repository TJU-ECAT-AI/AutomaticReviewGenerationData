1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study found that the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) can be studied by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion were determined. It was shown that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. Compared to that at the terminal O site, the propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. It is expected that an efficient catalyst for the ODH reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，有重大影响。研究发现，可以通过周期性密度泛函理论(DFT)计算研究丙烷在单晶V2O5(001)上的氧化脱氢(ODH)。确定了丙烷转化为丙烯的能学和路径。研究显示，丙烷的CH键可以被表面的终端和桥接晶格O原子以相似的活化能激活。在终端O位点，CH键活化可能通过自由基和氧插入两种途径，而在桥接O位点，只有氧插入机制是可行的。与终端O位点相比，桥接O位点的丙烯从丙氧基的产生要容易得多，因为丙氧基在桥接O上的结合力较弱。结论是，单晶V2O5(001)不是一个好的催化剂，因为终端O太活跃，无法释放丙烯。预计有效的ODH反应催化剂必须在激活CH键的能力和释放丙烯的能力之间做出妥协。
