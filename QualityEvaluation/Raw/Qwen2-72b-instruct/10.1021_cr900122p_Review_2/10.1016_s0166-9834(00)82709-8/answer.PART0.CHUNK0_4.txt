[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
[2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
[3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

1.The zinc-exchanged form of ZSM-5 zeolite (ZSM-5-Zn) and the proton-exchanged form (ZSM-5-H) have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures ranging from 730 to 820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was found to be more active and provided better selectivity for BTX (60-70%). The conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to C1-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H, dehydrogenation is rate-controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn, this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversion were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The mechanism by which ZSM-5-H might initiate a radical-chain reaction is still speculative. ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show different dependences of selectivity on space velocity. Over ZSM-5-Zn, the high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in increasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation. The present results suggest that part of the C1-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

1.研究了锌交换ZSM-5沸石（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换形式（ZSM-5-H）在730至820 K的温度范围内将丙烷转化为芳烃。ZSM-5-Zn被发现更活跃，并提供了更好的BTX选择性（60-70%）。转化机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是寡聚化和芳构化。裂解至C1-C2产品是并行反应。两种催化剂上的主要脱氢反应在机制上是不同的：在ZSM-5-H上，脱氢是速率控制的，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，这一步骤处于准平衡状态。丙烷转化的表观活化能为ZSM-5-Zn（1.28 wt%铝）121+15 kJ mol-1，ZSM-5-Zn（0.71 wt%铝）104+15 kJ mol-1，ZSM-5-H（1.28 wt%铝）120+15 kJ mol-1。在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加。ZSM-5-H可能引发自由基链反应的方式仍然是推测性的。ZSM-5-H和ZSM-5-Zn在空间速度上的选择性依赖性不同。在ZSM-5-Zn上，沸石通道中氢的高扩散速率导致随着空间速度的增加，局部氢浓度的增加性耗尽，从而将平衡推向BTX的形成。目前的结果表明，在ZSM-5催化剂，特别是ZSM-5-Zn上形成的C1-C3烃类产物的一部分可能来自芳烃产物的二次脱甲基反应。
