1.The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins).

1.研究了锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换（ZSM-5-H）形式的ZSM-5沸石催化剂在730-820 K温度范围内将丙烷转化为芳烃。ZSM-5-Zn更活跃，给出了更好的BTX选择性。转化机制的主要特征涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是寡聚化和芳构化。裂解至Cl-C2产物是并行反应。两种催化剂上的初级脱氢反应在机制上是不同的：在ZSM-5-H上，脱氢是受速率控制的，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，这一步骤处于准平衡状态。丙烷转化的表观活化能为ZSM-5-Zn（1.28 wt%铝）121+15 kJ mol-1，ZSM-5-Zn（0.71 wt%铝）104+15 kJ mol-1，ZSM-5-H（1.28 wt%铝）120+15 kJ mol-1。在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加。ZSM-5-H可能引发自由基链反应的方式仍然存在猜测。然而，已知在高硅沸石上吸附芳烃或烯烃可以涉及电子转移过程，并生成一些可以通过EPR检测的自由基物种。与质子形式的催化剂相比，不同的行为源于基本上不同的芳构化机制。ZSM-5-Zn上的芳构化产生氢气，而ZSM-5-H上的氢化转移机制（产生石蜡）则不同。目前的结果表明，在ZSM-5催化剂（特别是ZSM-5-Zn）上丙烷转化形成的C,-C3烃产物中，部分可能来自芳烃产物的二次脱甲基反应。
