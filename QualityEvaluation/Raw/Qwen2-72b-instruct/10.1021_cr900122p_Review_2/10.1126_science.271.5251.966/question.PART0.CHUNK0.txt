Reaction of ZrNp4 with the silanol groups of a Degussa Aerosil silica pretreated at 500C leads to the surface complex ( S - O)ZrNp3
( I ) ,
which has been characterized previously by surface microanalysis and 13C cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nu- clear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy (2). Treat- ment of 1 with H, at around 150C leads to the formation of silica-supported zirconium hydride and silicon hydride (2) (3-5). W e have characterized these various surface species by extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and 'H and 19Si solid- state NMR and IR spectroscopy.Analysis of the Zr K-edge EXAFS of 1 (6) (Fig. 1A and Table 1) gave a first cooordination sphere of one Ooatom at 1.96 A and three C atoms at 2.22 A; despite the similarity of 0 and C p h p e  shifts, attempts to fit an 0 sheil at 2.22 A together with a C shell at 1.96 A or to fit two shells of 0-C resulted in significantly increased refinement (R) factors and unacceptable Debye-Waller factors fqr the two shells. A n  additional shell at 3.42 A could be tentatively assigned to a shell of approximately three nonbonding neopentyl C atoms, although the quality of the data almost certainly limits the precision of this distant shell. The Zr-0 distance is similar to those observed in the siloxyzir- conium copplexes (DME)ZrCl,(OSiPh,),[1.91(1) A] (7) and [(r15-CSHs)2Zr(e- OSiPh,O)], [1.974(2) and 1.983(2) A] (8) and is also comparable to the Zr-0 bond lengths in the hydroxy complexes Cp*,Zr(OH), [1.975(8) and 1.9!2(7) A] (9) and Cp",Zr(OH)C1[1.950(2) A] (9),suggesting essentially a single-bond charac- ter in the surface complex (DME, dimeth- ylether; Ph, phenyl; Cp", pentamethylcy- clopentadienyl; the numbers in parenthe- ses after the lengths are the standard errors in the l?st digits). The Zr-C distance of 2.22 A is shorter than those observed in (r15-CjHj)2Zr(CH2SiMe3);(Me, meth- yl) [2.278(4) and 2.281(4) A] (I?), (q5- C5H5),Zr (CH,CMe,), [2.294(8)
A] (101,
and <r(CH2Ph)4 (2.23, 2.26, 2.28, and
2.29 A )  (1
1) but is still within the expect- ed range for a Zr-C bond (1 2). Taking the EXAFS Zr-C and C-C distances as 2.22 and 1.54 A,respectively, the Zr-C-C angle is calculated to be 130, with an estimated error of 5' to 10'; this compares very favorably with the Zr-C-X angles in iq5- CjHj)2Zr(CH,XMe3)2 (9) of 133.8(2)" and 135.2(2)" (X = Si) and 142.7(5)" (X = C ) .  The EXAFS results thus strongly support the presence of discrete [Sil-0- ZrNp, surface species.Treatment of (=Si-O)ZrNp, with H 2 at 150C resulted in a significant change in the Zr K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 1B). This is in agreement with previous in situ IR and NMR experiments, which indicated the formation of a zirconium hydride species ( 2 )  [zirconium-hydride stretching absor- bance v(Zr-H) band at 1635 cm-' and 'H Fig. 1.The (top) Zr K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS and (bottom) Fourier transform, phase-shift corrected for oxygen, o f (A) (=Si-0)-ZrNp, and (6) (=Si-O),-ZrH from experiment (solid lines) and spherical wave theory (dotted lines).MAS NMR peak at chemical shift 6 = 10 parts per million (ppm) (3, 13)]. By reac- tion with various halogenated compounds (such as CH31 and C2HjBr),it was found that there is an average of one hydride ligand per Zr (3). Analysis of the EXAFS data revealed a first coordination sphere of three 0 atoms at 1.94 A, consistent with single-bond formation. However, the R factor could be decrzased by 15% if an additional 0 at 2.61 A was included in the EXAFS fit, suggesting a possible longer range Zr interaction with a fourth surface 0 .These results (EXAFS, IR, NMR, and chemical reactivity) allow us to propose the formulation (Si-O),Zr-H for the sup- ported zirconium hydride species. W e  sug- gest a plausible mechanism for its forma- tion (Scheme l ) based on the observation of two IR bands at 2253 and 2195 cm-',which were attributed to the presence of surface silanes. In addition, the IR data indicate that these surface silanes corre- spond to a silicon dihydride species (1 4 ) , T h e  formation of =SiH, means that two Si-0 bonds of the same Si atom have been broken. The presence of surface silanes has also been indicated by solid-state NMR (13).The simultaneous formation of =SiH2 and (=Si-O),Zr-H species from the (=Si- O)ZrNp3 complex demonstrates that the hydrogenolysis of a sterically hindered (=Si-O)ZrNp,surface fragment results in the opening of the very strong Si-0-Si bonds. T o  understand this phenomenon, we must consider a system such as the one depicted in Scheme 1: The postulated ZrH3 intermediate resulting from the hydro- genolysis of the three neopentyl groups of (=Si-O)ZrNp3 is bonded to a S i 0 4  tetra- hedron. W e  assume that two Si-0-Si bridg- es of this tetrahedron will be broken, with coordination of the 0 to the Zr and of the hydride to the Si, in agreement with the above results. Zirconium is more oxophilic than Si and has a similar bonding enthalpy for the M-H bond (M = Zr or Si); there- fore, this is a realistic hypothesis. The dis- tance from the 0 atoTs to the Zr atom is not very large (-2.4 A by molecular me- chanics), and so the reaction (Scheme 1) 2 Scheme 1. The Zr, 0-1, Si-1, 0-4, and Si-2 at- oms are shown in the same plane. The atoms 0-2 and 0-3 are symmetrical with respect to this plane.

should proceed relatively easily. In this model, the =SiH2 entity is "protected" by the zirconium hydride, probably inducing the long relaxation rates experimentally ob- served in 29Si NMR (13). Also, the 0 - 4 aJom is not very far from the Zr atom (-2.9 A by molecular mechanics without optimi- zation of the structure); it is probably this 0 that lea+ to the EXAFS coordination shell at 2.61 A. This distance could result from a slight distortion of the SiH202 tetrahedron (IR data indicate that the H-Si-H angle is -95';the 0 - S i - 0  angle probably increases compared with its normal value of 109").
These results show that reaction of the well-defined (Si-O)ZrNp3 complex (where the Zr atom is tetracoordinated) leads to the formation of a zirconium monohydride spe- cies, (%-O),-ZrH,and a silicon dihydride species, =SiH,. The resulting structure is ex- ceptional and can be interpreted to explain the catalytic process of hydrogenolysis. In this structure, the zirconium hydride has an eight- electron configuraiion (10 if one considers the 0 - 4  at 2.64 A). Molecular ZrlIV) hu-
,,
drides are generally stabilized by two cyclo- pentadienyl ligands. They are thus 16-elec- tron species and therefore less electrophilic than 2. The immobilization of the hydride on a surface apparently prevents dimeriiation,which would normally occur for truly molec- ular species.
W e  are proposing a mechanism by which the catalyst operates on a "supramo- lecular" basis, that is, by including both the surface structure of the catalyst and the alkanes. The mechanism is based on pre- liminary results concerning the elementarv steps of C-H bond activation with such a catalyst (3, 4), as well as some elementary steps of P-alkyl transfer that are known to occur when an alkyl group or chain is linked to an earlv transition metal 115). In ,the particular case of neopentane hydro- genolysis, the mechanism involves the for- mation of a Zr-CH,C(CH,),species by o-bond metathesis, followed by P-methyl transfer to give isobutylene and a Zr-CH3 species. The latter is converted to methane by H,, with regeneration of the Zr-H cata- lyst.
The primary product isobutylene was not identified, probably because the catalyst rapidly converted it to isobutane under H 2' Isobutane undergoes further hydrogenolysis to propane and methane; propane is hy- drogenolyzed to ethane and methane.Ethane is not cleaved, presumably because the ethylzirconium intermediate lacks a P-methyl group.This mechanism, which occurs at room temperature, is quite similar to that de- scribed by Mango et al. ( I ) ,  which was proposed to explain the methane formation in natural gas. Our results support strongly the assumption that methane in natural gas could be the result of a catalytic process under mild conditions; high temperature may not be a requirement for the forma- tion of natural gas. It is quite possible that under hydrogen [its average concentration in natural gas is -700 ppm and in some cases can reach 50% (I)], sedimentary rocks containing transition metals such as Zr or T i  may contain a small amount of surface hydride that is able to cleave cat- alytically the C-H and C-C bonds of al- kanes or alkenes.
