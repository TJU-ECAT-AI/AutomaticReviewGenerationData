1.The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted.

1.研究了具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434.2 V/nm2)和结构的Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物的催化性能,用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。在给定的反应温度下,丙烯形成速率大约是乙烯形成速率的八倍,但两种反应物的表观ODH活化能(E1)相似,对钒氧化物表面密度相对不敏感。在避免均相反应(<800 K)的高温下操作,主要含有孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂可以获得最高的烯烃产量。氧化物域尺寸和支撑对速率和选择性的影响归因于VOx和支撑表面的酸碱性质。以前的报道中,VOx表面密度和结构对乙烷和丙烷ODH反应的速率和选择性的影响存在一些不一致的结果。由于缺乏详细的结构表征和对积分(高转化率)速率和选择性数据的严格动力学分析,以及在许多先前研究的高温和高转化率下普遍存在的温度梯度和可能的均相反应,导致了持续的争议。光谱学结果表明,在低表面密度下,通过VOAl键与支撑连接的扭曲四面体单钒酸盐结构普遍存在。随着V表面密度的增加,通过导致VOx物种之间VOV键的反应形成二维多钒酸盐。超过单层覆盖的VOx物种与多钒酸盐结构反应,形成最终结晶成块体V2O5的三维结构,有证据表明存在残留的单钒酸盐物种。V原子的速率随表面密度的增加而增加,即使V原子随着三维结构的形成而变得越来越不可用于催化。在完成多钒酸盐单层后获得的恒定面积速率表明,一旦主要结构涉及VOV键,VOx物种的表面反应性就变得独立于域尺寸。表面钒密度最低(1.4 V/nm2)且主要含有单钒酸盐的样品对乙烷和丙烷ODH都显示出最高的初始烯烃选择性。k2/k1的比率对于乙烷是独立于表面密度的,而对于丙烷,它随着钒表面密度的增加而增加。k3/k1的比率对于两种反应物都随着钒表面密度的增加而增加。k3/k1和k2/k1的较小值导致所有反应物转化水平的烯烃选择性更高。k2/k1的比率对于乙烷ODH在反应温度和钒表面密度方面都是相对独立的。k2/k1的比率独立于反应温度,但随着丙烷ODH的钒表面密度的增加而增加。然而,k3/k1通常对于丙烷比对于乙烷ODH更高,表明丙烯相对于丙烷比乙烯相对于乙烷更具有反应性。乙烷和丙烷ODH以及乙烷和丙烷燃烧的活化能E1和E2的大小相似,在115  20 kJ/mol左右,并且对钒表面密度的依赖性较弱。在663 K时,丙烯形成速率大约是乙烯形成速率的八倍,这表明在活化状态下,乙氧基物种的稳定化能可能相对于异丙氧基更高。烯烃燃烧的表观活化能E3为6090 kJ/mol,并且随着钒表面密度的增加而增加,导致E13随着钒表面密度的增加而减少。E3和E13的趋势似乎是由于随着钒表面密度的增加,烯烃吸附变得越来越放热引起的。烯烃选择性通常随着反应温度的升高和钒表面密度的降低而增加。因此,在避免均相反应的最高可能反应温度下操作,主要含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂可以获得最高的烯烃产量。

High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

1.研究了具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434.2 V/nm2)和结构的Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物的催化性能,用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。随着表面密度的增加,二维多钒酸盐出现,伴随着V2O5晶体在表面密度高于7.0 V/nm2时的增加量。每V原子的乙烯和丙烯生成速率受钒氧化物表面密度的强烈影响,并在中间表面密度(8 V/nm2)达到最大值。在主要包含孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂上,在避免均相反应(<800 K)的高温下操作,可以获得最高的烯烃产量。氧化物域尺寸和支撑对速率和选择性的影响归因于VOx和支撑表面的酸碱性质。支撑VOx域的局部结构强烈影响ODH反应速率和选择性。在合理的停留时间内获得高烯烃产量需要k1的高值和k2/k1和k3/k1的低值。关于乙烷和丙烷ODH反应速率和选择性对VOx表面密度和结构的影响,以前的报道有些不一致。缺乏详细的结构表征和对积分(高转化率)速率和选择性数据的严格动力学分析,以及在许多先前研究的高温和高转化率下普遍存在的温度梯度和可能的均相反应,导致了持续的争议。报告了对具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434 VOx/nm2)的VOx/Al2O3样品的乙烷ODH反应的详细动力学分析,并与使用丙烷作为反应物的结果进行了对比。这种分析与这些催化剂的详细结构表征相结合,以将它们的局部结构与表征这些催化材料功能的速率常数的值联系起来。此外,对比了具有不同CH键能和不同吸附能的乙烷和丙烷分子的反应速率。
