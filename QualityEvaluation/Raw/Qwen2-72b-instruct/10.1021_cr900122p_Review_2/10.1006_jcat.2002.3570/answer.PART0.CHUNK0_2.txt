1.研究了具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434.2 V/nm2)和结构的Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物的催化性能，用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。随着表面密度的增加，二维多钒酸盐出现，表面密度高于7.0 V/nm2时，V2O5晶体的量逐渐增加。每V原子的乙烯和丙烯生成速率受钒氧化物表面密度的强烈影响，在中间表面密度(8 V/nm2)时达到最大值。在主要包含孤立单钒酸盐物种并在避免均相反应的高温下操作的催化剂中，可以获得最高的烯烃产量。氧化物域尺寸和支撑物对速率和选择性的影响归因于VOx和支撑物表面的酸碱性质。支撑VOx域的局部结构强烈影响ODH反应速率和选择性。在合理的停留时间内获得高烯烃产率需要k1的高值和k2/k1和k3/k1的低值。以前报道了VOx表面密度和结构对乙烷和丙烷ODH反应速率和选择性的影响，但结果有些不一致。缺乏详细的结构表征和严格的动力学分析，以及许多先前研究中高温和高转化率下普遍存在的温度梯度和可能的均相反应，导致了持续的争议。
