1.研究了具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434.2 V/nm2)和结构的Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物的催化性能,用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。在给定的反应温度下,丙烯形成速率大约是乙烯形成速率的八倍,但两种反应物的表观ODH活化能(E1)相似,对钒氧化物表面密度相对不敏感。在避免均相反应(<800 K)的高温下操作,主要含有孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂可以获得最高的烯烃产量。氧化物域尺寸和支撑对速率和选择性的影响归因于VOx和支撑表面的酸碱性质。以前的报道中,VOx表面密度和结构对乙烷和丙烷ODH反应的速率和选择性的影响存在一些不一致的结果。由于缺乏详细的结构表征和对积分(高转化率)速率和选择性数据的严格动力学分析,以及在许多先前研究的高温和高转化率下普遍存在的温度梯度和可能的均相反应,导致了持续的争议。光谱学结果表明,在低表面密度下,通过VOAl键与支撑连接的扭曲四面体单钒酸盐结构普遍存在。随着V表面密度的增加,通过导致VOx物种之间VOV键的反应形成二维多钒酸盐。超过单层覆盖的VOx物种与多钒酸盐结构反应,形成最终结晶成块体V2O5的三维结构,有证据表明存在残留的单钒酸盐物种。V原子的速率随表面密度的增加而增加,即使V原子随着三维结构的形成而变得越来越不可用于催化。在完成多钒酸盐单层后获得的恒定面积速率表明,一旦主要结构涉及VOV键,VOx物种的表面反应性就变得独立于域尺寸。表面钒密度最低(1.4 V/nm2)且主要含有单钒酸盐的样品对乙烷和丙烷ODH都显示出最高的初始烯烃选择性。k2/k1的比率对于乙烷是独立于表面密度的,而对于丙烷,它随着钒表面密度的增加而增加。k3/k1的比率对于两种反应物都随着钒表面密度的增加而增加。k3/k1和k2/k1的较小值导致所有反应物转化水平的烯烃选择性更高。k2/k1的比率对于乙烷ODH在反应温度和钒表面密度方面都是相对独立的。k2/k1的比率独立于反应温度,但随着丙烷ODH的钒表面密度的增加而增加。然而,k3/k1通常对于丙烷比对于乙烷ODH更高,表明丙烯相对于丙烷比乙烯相对于乙烷更具有反应性。乙烷和丙烷ODH以及乙烷和丙烷燃烧的活化能E1和E2的大小相似,在115  20 kJ/mol左右,并且对钒表面密度的依赖性较弱。在663 K时,丙烯形成速率大约是乙烯形成速率的八倍,这表明在活化状态下,乙氧基物种的稳定化能可能相对于异丙氧基更高。烯烃燃烧的表观活化能E3为6090 kJ/mol,并且随着钒表面密度的增加而增加,导致E13随着钒表面密度的增加而减少。E3和E13的趋势似乎是由于随着钒表面密度的增加,烯烃吸附变得越来越放热引起的。烯烃选择性通常随着反应温度的升高和钒表面密度的降低而增加。因此,在避免均相反应的最高可能反应温度下操作,主要含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂可以获得最高的烯烃产量。
