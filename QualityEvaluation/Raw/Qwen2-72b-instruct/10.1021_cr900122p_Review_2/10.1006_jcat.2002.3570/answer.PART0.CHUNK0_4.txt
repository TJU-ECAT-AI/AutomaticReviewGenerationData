1.The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

1.研究了具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434.2 V/nm2)和结构的Al2O3支撑的钒氧化物的催化性能,用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。随着表面密度的增加,二维多钒酸盐出现,伴随着V2O5晶体在表面密度高于7.0 V/nm2时的增加量。每V原子的乙烯和丙烯生成速率受钒氧化物表面密度的强烈影响,并在中间表面密度(8 V/nm2)达到最大值。在主要包含孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂上,在避免均相反应(<800 K)的高温下操作,可以获得最高的烯烃产量。氧化物域尺寸和支撑对速率和选择性的影响归因于VOx和支撑表面的酸碱性质。支撑VOx域的局部结构强烈影响ODH反应速率和选择性。在合理的停留时间内获得高烯烃产量需要k1的高值和k2/k1和k3/k1的低值。关于乙烷和丙烷ODH反应速率和选择性对VOx表面密度和结构的影响,以前的报道有些不一致。缺乏详细的结构表征和对积分(高转化率)速率和选择性数据的严格动力学分析,以及在许多先前研究的高温和高转化率下普遍存在的温度梯度和可能的均相反应,导致了持续的争议。报告了对具有广泛VOx表面密度(1.434 VOx/nm2)的VOx/Al2O3样品的乙烷ODH反应的详细动力学分析,并与使用丙烷作为反应物的结果进行了对比。这种分析与这些催化剂的详细结构表征相结合,以将它们的局部结构与表征这些催化材料功能的速率常数的值联系起来。此外,对比了具有不同CH键能和不同吸附能的乙烷和丙烷分子的反应速率。
