[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."
[3] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."
[4] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively investigated in the past few years with many different spectroscopies [3]: Raman [5,42], IR [5,43], XANES/EXAFS [44], solid state 51V NMR [21,45,46], UV-VIS DRS [47,48], chemiluminescence [49,50] and EPR [51]."
[5] "These studies have revealed that the surface structures and oxidation states of the surface vanadia species are dynamic and are strongly dependent on the environment (oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture and temperature)."
[6] "The in situ Raman studies provide new insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the dehydrated V(5) surface vanadia species appears to be the predominant surface vanadia species, (2) the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species depends on the reducing power of the hydrocarbon (methanol> butene>butane>methane), (3) the specific oxide support and (4) the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species (polymerized>isolated)."
[7] "The greater stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be directly related to the fact that only isolated surface vanadia species are present in this catalyst."
[8] "The TOF for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde over VEO5frio2, as well as other supported vanadia catalysts, is independent of the surface vanadia coverage indicating that the oxygen associated with the bridging functionality does not critically affect this reaction [9]."
[9] "The TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]."
[10] "The TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride over V2Os/TiO2 was also found to slightly increase, by a factor of 2-3, with surface vanadia coverage because of the requirement of several surface vanadia sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction (see discussion below) [36]."
[11] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
[12] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."
[13] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity,are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. These catalysts have found commercial application in selective oxidation reactions, such as the oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR. They have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride, and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde or methyl formate. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques, revealing that the surface structures and oxidation states of the surface vanadia species are dynamic and strongly dependent on the environment, including oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture, and temperature. The behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions is influenced by the dehydrated V(5+) surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5+) silica supported vanadia species is attributed to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The TOF for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is independent of the surface vanadia coverage, indicating that the oxygen associated with the bridging functionality does not critically affect this reaction. The TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds. The TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride slightly increases with surface vanadia coverage due to the requirement of several surface vanadia sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, as changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The trend of TOF variation with different oxide supports inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有重大影响。支撑的钒氧化物催化剂，含有在氧化物支撑上的表面钒酸物种，被广泛用于许多烃氧化反应中。这些催化剂在选择性氧化反应中找到了商业应用，如邻二甲苯氧化为邻苯二甲酸酐、烷基芳烃的氨氧化、NOx与NH3的有选择性催化还原，以及在SCR中控制SO2氧化为SO3。它们还被研究用于烷烃的氧化脱氢、丁烷氧化为马来酸酐、戊烷氧化为马来酸酐，以及甲醇选择性氧化为甲醛或甲酸甲酯。表面钒酸物种的分子结构已经通过各种光谱技术进行了广泛研究，揭示了表面钒酸物种的表面结构和氧化态是动态的，强烈依赖于环境，包括氧化和还原气体、水分和温度。表面钒酸物种在烃氧化反应中的行为受到脱水V(5+)表面钒酸物种、表面钒酸物种的还原程度、特定的氧化物支撑和聚合与孤立表面钒酸物种的比例的影响。V(5+)硅支撑的钒酸物种的稳定性可直接归因于该催化剂中仅存在孤立的表面钒酸物种。甲醇氧化为甲醛的TOF与表面钒酸覆盖度无关，表明与桥接功能相关的氧并不关键影响这一反应。丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的TOF并不依赖于桥接V-O-V键的浓度。丁烷氧化为马来酸酐的TOF随着表面钒酸覆盖度的增加而略有增加，这是由于这种烃氧化反应需要几个表面钒酸位点。桥接V-O-支撑键似乎与烃氧化反应所需的临界氧相关，因为改变特定的氧化物支撑会极大地影响TOF。不同氧化物支撑的TOF变化趋势与氧化物支撑阳离子的桑德森电负性成反比，表明在V-O-支撑键中更电负或更碱性的桥接氧与支撑的钒酸催化剂上烃氧化反应所需的临界氧相关。
