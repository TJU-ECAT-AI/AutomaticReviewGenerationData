[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."
[3] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."
[4] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively investigated in the past few years with many different spectroscopies [3]: Raman [5,42], IR [5,43], XANES/EXAFS [44], solid state 51V NMR [21,45,46], UV-VIS DRS [47,48], chemiluminescence [49,50] and EPR [51]."
[5] "These studies have revealed that the surface structures and oxidation states of the surface vanadia species are dynamic and are strongly dependent on the environment (oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture and temperature)."
[6] "The in situ Raman studies provide new insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the dehydrated V(5) surface vanadia species appears to be the predominant surface vanadia species, (2) the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species depends on the reducing power of the hydrocarbon (methanol> butene>butane>methane), (3) the specific oxide support and (4) the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species (polymerized>isolated)."
[7] "The greater stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be directly related to the fact that only isolated surface vanadia species are present in this catalyst."
[8] "The surface vanadia species are more extensively reduced during butene oxidation than butane oxida- tion since even the surface vanadia species on silica was reduced during butene oxidation [36]."
[9] "The surface vanadia species could be completely reduced in a methanol stream in the absence of oxygen."
[10] "The in situ Raman studies, however, did not provide any molecular structural information about the reduced surface V(4+) or V(3+) species formed during the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since no new Raman bands were observed [35,36,58]."
[11] "Molecular structural information about the reduced surface vanadia species present under reaction conditions can be obtained from in situ UV-VIS DRS and EXAFS/XANES experiments, but such studies are currently not avail- able in the literature."
[12] "Thus, our fundamental knowledge of supported vanadia catalysts will be further advanced once information becomes available about the molecular structures of the in situ reduced surface vanadia species during hydro- carbon oxidation reactions."
[13] "The influence of preparation methods upon the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has also been examined [3,5,28,64,65]."
[14] "All the catalysts were found to contain the same surface vanadia species independent of the initial synthesis method after equilibration of the catalysts after prolonged calcination."
[15] "The absence of a "preparation memory effect" is due to the high mobility of V205 (Tamman temperature of 370C) and the strong driving force of the mixed oxide system to lower its surface free energy by forming a monolayer of surface vanadia species, which possesses a low surface free energy, on the high surface free energy oxide support [28,65]."
[16] "The formation of the monolayer is even observed during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over physical mixtures of V205 and TiO2 [30]."
[17] "The in situ characterization studies (Section 5.5) revealed that dehydrated surface vanadia species are present during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions and, consequently, the reactivity properties need to be related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species."
[18] "The reduction characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts have been inves- tigated with different probe molecules: hydrogen, butane, and ammonia."
[19] "The hydrogen TPR studies could generally not discriminate between the reduction characteristics of isolated and polymerized surface vanadia species because only one hydrogen TPR peak was observed in these studies."
[20] "In situ Raman studies during the reduction of V2Os/TiO2 catalysts revealed that both the isolated and polymerized surface vanadia species were about equally reduced by hydrogen [87]."
[21] "In contrast, reduction with ammonia [88] or butane [89] exhibited preferential reduction of the polymerized surface vanadia species over the isolated surface vanadia species."
[22] "The addition of noninteracting additives to supported vanadia catalysts (e.g., WO3 to V2Os/TiO2) slightly enhanced the reduction of the surface vanadia species [90]."
[23] "The introduction of interacting surface additives such as K significantly retard the reduction of the surface vanadia species,but the introduction of surface P had only a slight effect on the reduction of the surface vanadia species [92]."
[24] "The surface vanadia species possesses both Lewis and BrCnsted acid properties and the ratio of BrCnsted acidity to Lewis acidity increases with surface vanadia coverage (see discussion above in Section 6)."
[25] "However, neither of these char- acteristics appear to influence the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [94] over V2Os/TiO2 since these oxidation reactions exhibit the same behavior at all surface vanadia coverages."
[26] "The oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride does show a slight enhancement in activity and selectivity with surface vanadia coverage, but this is mostly due to the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites for this reaction rather than surface acidity properties [36]."
[27] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
[28] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
[29] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
[30] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
[31] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
[32] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
[33] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
[34] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
[35] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
[36] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
[37] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
