[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide com- mercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."
[3] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."
[4] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively investigated in the past few years with many different spectroscopies [3]: Raman [5,42], IR [5,43], XANES/EXAFS [44], solid state 51V NMR [21,45,46], UV-VIS DRS [47,48], chemiluminescence [49,50] and EPR [51]."
[5] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are dynamic and are strongly dependent on the environment (oxidizing and reducing gases, moisture and temperature)."
[6] "The surface vanadia species on silica consists of isolated VOx units containing one terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-Si bonds (trigonal pyramidal coordination)."
[7] "The dehydrated surface vanadia species on other oxide supports all essentially possess identical molecular structures as probed by Raman [3,42,43], IR [3,43],and solid state 51V NMR [45,52]."
[8] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."
[9] "The surface vanadia species are more extensively reduced during butene oxidation than butane oxida- tion since even the surface vanadia species on silica was reduced during butene oxidation [36]."
[10] "The greater stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be directly related to the fact that only isolated surface vanadia species are present in this catalyst."
[11] "The in situ Raman studies provide new insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the dehydrated V(5) surface vanadia species appears to be the predominant surface vanadia species, (2) the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species depends on the reducing power of the hydrocarbon (methanol> butene>butane>methane), (3) the specific oxide support and (4) the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species (polymerized>isolated)."
[12] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
[13] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."
[14] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity,are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."
[15] "The invariance of the TOF for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde with surface vanadia coverage over supported vanadia catalysts suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction."
[16] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
[17] "The invariance of the TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/TiO2 as a function of surface vanadia coverage also suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction [94]."
[18] "The introduction of surface niobia species to V2Os/TiO2 catalysts increases the TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [36]."
[19] "This increase in TOF reflects the requirement of multiple surface metal oxide sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction."
[20] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
[21] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
[22] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
[23] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
[24] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
[25] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
