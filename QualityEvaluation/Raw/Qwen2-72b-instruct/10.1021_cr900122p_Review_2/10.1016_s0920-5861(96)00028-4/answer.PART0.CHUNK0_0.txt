1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products. They catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction. The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps. They allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. The introduction of Ga and Zn cations into H-ZSM5 channels may introduce momentary hydrogen acceptors that allow the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H 2. The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectivity. The introduction of alternate H-disposal pathways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn), removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity. These factors contribute to their industrial significance in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。丙烷脱氢环二聚化形成芳烃的速率受到一系列不可逆脱氢反应的限制。Ga和Zn物种增加了丙烷化学转化率、重组氢脱附和D 2反应产物中氘的掺入。它们催化了在酸催化C-H键活化反应中形成的H-原子的重组脱附。在H-ZSM5上,丙烷脱氢环二聚化周转期间几个H-原子的连续释放限制了该反应的速率和选择性。Ga和Zn物种通过重组脱附在脱氢步骤中形成的H-原子来增加H 2的形成速率。它们允许脱氢反应在没有同时裂解的条件下进行。向H-ZSM5通道中添加金属物种会增加芳烃周转率并降低裂解周转率。将Ga和Zn阳离子引入H-ZSM5通道可能会引入瞬时氢受体,允许H-原子作为H 2的重组脱附。Ga物种的存在允许气相氢气解离吸附,并有效地与表面位点竞争,从而降低芳烃的选择性。通过使用化学计量受体(CO、CO 2或0 2)或金属阳离子(Ga或Zn)引入替代的H-处置途径,可以去除从形成轻烷烃并降低芳烃选择性的其他步骤中去除氢的负担。这些因素对氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程的工业意义有贡献。
