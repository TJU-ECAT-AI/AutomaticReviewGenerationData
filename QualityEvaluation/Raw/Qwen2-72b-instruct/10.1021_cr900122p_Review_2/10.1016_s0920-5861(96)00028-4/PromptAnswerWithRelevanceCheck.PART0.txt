[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
[2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
[3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
[4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
[5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
[6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
[7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
[8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
[9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption and of H 2 dissociative adsorption during propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions."
[10] "Ga and Zn species increase markedly the rate of propane conversion to propene."
[11] "The role of metal cations during reactions of methylcyclohexane on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 is consistent with the significant hydrogen removal requirements of such reactions."
[12] "Ga species also increase markedly the rate of propane conversion to propene."
[13] "The introduction of Ga and Zn cations into H-ZSM5 channels may introduce momentary hydrogen acceptors that allow the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H 2."
[14] "The presence of Ga species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- tively adsorb and to effectively compete for surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- ity."
[15] "The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors (CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn),removes the burden of hydrogen removal from other steps that form light alkanes and reduce aromatics selectivity."

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。丙烷脱氢环二聚化形成芳烃的速率受到一系列不可逆脱氢反应的限制。Ga和Zn物种增加了丙烷化学转化率、重组氢脱附和D 2反应产物中氘的掺入。它们催化了在酸催化C-H键活化反应中形成的H-原子的重组脱附。在H-ZSM5上,丙烷脱氢环二聚化周转期间几个H-原子的连续释放限制了该反应的速率和选择性。Ga和Zn物种通过重组脱附在脱氢步骤中形成的H-原子来增加H 2的形成速率。它们允许脱氢反应在没有同时裂解的条件下进行。向H-ZSM5通道中添加金属物种会增加芳烃周转率并降低裂解周转率。将Ga和Zn阳离子引入H-ZSM5通道可能会引入瞬时氢受体,允许H-原子作为H 2的重组脱附。Ga物种的存在允许气相氢气解离吸附,并有效地与表面位点竞争,从而降低芳烃的选择性。通过使用化学计量受体(CO、CO 2或0 2)或金属阳离子(Ga或Zn)引入替代的H-处置途径,可以去除从形成轻烷烃并降低芳烃选择性的其他步骤中去除氢的负担。这些因素对氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程的工业意义有贡献。

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, the rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. The presence of Ga and Zn species increases the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance.
2.The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。例如,丙烷脱氢环二聚化形成C6芳烃的速率受到一系列不可逆脱氢反应的限制,这些反应导致各种不饱和烃和芳烃的生成。Ga和Zn物种的存在增加了丙烷化学转化率、重组氢脱附和D2中氘的掺入。这些金属物种通过催化重组脱附H原子形成二氢(H2)来促进C-H键活化步骤中形成的氢的处置。在H-ZSM5上,丙烷脱氢环二聚化周转期间几个H原子的连续释放限制了该反应的速率和选择性。Ga和Zn物种通过重组脱附在脱氢步骤中形成的H原子来增强H2的形成速率,使脱氢反应无需同时裂解即可发生。向H-ZSM5通道添加金属物种会增加芳烃周转率并降低裂解周转率。这些金属物种作为“端口”去除H原子,提高了烷烃转化的效率,对工业具有重要意义。
2.金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性归因于它们能够提高反应速率和选择性。Ga和Zn物种通过从活化C-H键的酸位点去除H原子来增加丙烯的生成速率,使酸位点无需形成裂解产物即可周转。这导致所需产品产量更高,副产品如甲烷和乙烷的生成减少。重组脱附选择性去除H原子也有助于从轻烷烃中以高选择性提取有价值的H2,这是工业过程中非常需要的。
