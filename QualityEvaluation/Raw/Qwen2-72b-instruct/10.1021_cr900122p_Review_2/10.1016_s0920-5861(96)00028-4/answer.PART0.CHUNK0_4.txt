1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of metal cations like Ga and Zn in the dehydrocyclodimerization of light alkanes on modified H-ZSM5 zeolites. The presence of these cations increases the rate of hydrogen disposal, propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity. They act as 'portholes' that catalyze the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, which is crucial for minimizing unwanted by-products and extracting valuable hydrogen with high selectivity from light alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert light alkanes to aromatics and dihydrogen, expanding the range of feedstocks available for petrochemicals and fuels.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了Ga和Zn金属阳离子在改性H-ZSM5沸石上轻烷烃脱氢环二聚化中的作用。这些阳离子的存在增加了氢的处置速率、丙烷的转化率和芳烃的选择性。它们充当“端口”，催化由酸催化C-H键断裂形成的氢原子的重组脱附，这对于最小化不需要的副产品和从轻烷烃中以高选择性提取有价值的氢至关重要。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够选择性地将轻烷烃转化为芳烃和二氢，扩大了可用于石化产品和燃料的原料范围。
