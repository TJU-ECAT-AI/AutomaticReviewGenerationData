[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite."
[2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)."
[3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation."
[4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively."
[6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，如锌交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。研究集中于锌交换沸石中乙烷脱氢至乙烯的过程，揭示了乙烷活化的两种不同途径。第一条途径涉及CH键的烷基活化，而第二条途径涉及卡宾活化。在Zn掺杂沸石催化剂中，烷烃脱氢为烯烃是芳构化过程的第一步，随后是脱氢环寡聚化。反应机制从乙烷CH键的烷基断裂开始，锌阳离子作为烷基基团的接受者。计算得出的三个步骤的活化能分别为18.4、53.4和20.5 kcal mol1。从卡宾活化开始的替代机制由于第一步的高活化能而不利。
