1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。例如，在Zn交换沸石中，金属阳离子在沸石通道中的位置和它们对质子的替代在催化活性向烷烃芳构化方面起着关键作用。烷基活化的催化循环包括三个基本步骤：在Zn-O对上断裂乙烷CH键，从与Zn结合的烷基基团形成乙烯，以及从与Zn结合的质子和氢形成二氢。这些步骤的计算活化能分别为18.4、53.4和20.5 kcal mol-1。从卡宾激活开始的替代机制由于第一步的高活化能（67.6 kcal mol-1）而不那么有利。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够提高沸石催化剂对小烷烃的芳构化选择性，这对商业Cyclar过程和其他轻烃的芳构化过程至关重要。
