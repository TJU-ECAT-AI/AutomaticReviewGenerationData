How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the mechanism of H/D exchange for propane on Zn/H-MFI is different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism involving Zn-propyl species or Zn2+ cations.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了Zn/H-MFI沸石上丙烷的区域选择性H/D交换，这是一种金属交换沸石。研究表明，嵌入的Zn2+离子作为强Lewis位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机制，有利于氢的去除。交换的区域选择性归因于两种提出的机制：(i)在Zn位点上丙烷脱氢，然后按照Markovnikov规则由酸性OH基团对丙烯进行质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中抽提氘离子；(ii)可逆的异裂解吸附丙烷，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性OH基团。研究还表明，Zn/H-MFI上丙烷的H/D交换机制与H-MFI和硫酸化锆石的报道不同，这表明了一种涉及Zn-丙基物种或Zn2+离子的替代机制。

The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, indicating that the mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI may be different from those reported for other catalysts.
