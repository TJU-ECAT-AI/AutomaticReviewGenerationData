1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. These findings suggest that the presence of metal ions in zeolites can significantly affect the selectivity and efficiency of alkane transformations.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了Zn/H-MFI沸石上丙烷的区域选择性H/D交换，这是一种金属交换沸石。研究表明，嵌入的Zn2+离子作为强Lewis位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机制，有利于氢的去除。交换的区域选择性归因于两种提出的机制：（i）丙烷在Zn位点的脱氢，随后根据马尔科夫尼科夫规则，由酸性OH基团对丙烯进行质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中提取氘离子；（ii）丙烷的可逆异裂吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性OH基团。这些发现表明，沸石中金属离子的存在可以显著影响烷烃转化的选择性和效率。
