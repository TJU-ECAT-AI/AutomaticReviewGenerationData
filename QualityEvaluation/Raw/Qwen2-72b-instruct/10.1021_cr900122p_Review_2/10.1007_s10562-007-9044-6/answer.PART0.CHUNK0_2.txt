1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了Zn/H-MFI沸石上丙烷的区域选择性H/D交换，这是一种金属交换沸石。研究显示，嵌入的Zn2+离子作为强Lewis位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机制，有利于氢的去除。交换的区域选择性归因于两种提出的机制：(i)在Zn位点上丙烷脱氢，然后按照马尔科夫尼科夫规则，由酸性OH基团对丙烯进行质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中抽提氘离子；(ii)可逆的异裂吸附丙烷，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性OH基团。研究还表明，沸石用Zn改性会改变交换机制，导致丙烷甲基组分的区域选择性。Zn/H-MFI上丙烷-d8的H/D交换的热力学参数与H-MFI和硫酸化锆石报道的参数不同，这表明Zn/H-MFI上丙烷的H/D交换反应存在替代机制。
