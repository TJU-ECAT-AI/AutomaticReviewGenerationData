1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the transformation of lower alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites, focusing on the conversion of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and hexane. It also mentions the conversion of alkenes into aromatics over ZSM-5 zeolites and borosilicates, and the conversion of methanol into aromatic hydrocarbons. The preparation of gallium- and zinc-loaded zeolites, their acidic properties, and the mechanism of alkane activation are also covered. The industrial significance of these processes is not explicitly stated, but the conversion of lower alkanes into higher-value aromatic hydrocarbons is a significant process in the petrochemical industry.

1.文献没有提供具体信息关于金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，如何影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，以及哪些因素对它们的工业意义有贡献。然而，它确实讨论了ZSM-5沸石上较低烷烃转化为芳香烃，重点是乙烷、丙烷、丁烷、异丁烷、戊烷和己烷的转化。它还提到了ZSM-5沸石和硼硅酸盐上烯烃转化为芳烃，以及甲醇转化为芳香烃。还涵盖了镓和锌负载沸石的制备，它们的酸性性质，以及烷烃活化的机制。这些过程的工业意义没有明确说明，但较低烷烃转化为更高价值的芳香烃是石化工业中一个重要的过程。
