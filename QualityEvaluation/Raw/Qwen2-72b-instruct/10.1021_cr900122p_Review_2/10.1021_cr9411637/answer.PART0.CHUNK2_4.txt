1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the synthesis, structure, and catalytic properties of various gallium-substituted zeolites and mesoporous silicates, which can be used in alkane transformations. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts can be influenced by factors such as the type of metal incorporated, the framework structure of the zeolite, the Si/M ratio, the presence of framework or nonframework metal species, and the pretreatment conditions of the catalyst. For example, gallium-substituted ZSM-5 zeolites have been used in the aromatization of alkanes, and the activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be affected by the degree of gallium incorporation, the calcination temperature, and the presence of residual fluoride ions. Similarly, mesoporous silicates such as MCM-41 and MCM-48 can be modified with gallium to introduce Brønsted acidity and catalyze reactions such as the conversion of acetone to isobutene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their potential to improve the efficiency and selectivity of alkane transformations, which can lead to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了各种镓取代沸石和介孔硅酸盐的合成、结构和催化性能，这些催化剂可以用于烷烃转化。这些催化剂的效率和选择性可能受到诸如掺入金属的类型、沸石的框架结构、Si/M比、框架或非框架金属物种的存在以及催化剂预处理条件等因素的影响。例如，镓取代的ZSM-5沸石已被用于烷烃的芳构化，这些催化剂的活性和选择性可能受到镓掺入程度、煅烧温度和残留氟离子的存在等因素的影响。同样，介孔硅酸盐如MCM-41和MCM-48可以通过镓进行改性，引入布伦斯特酸性，催化如将丙酮转化为异丁烯等反应。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们有可能提高烷烃转化的效率和选择性，这可以带来成本节约和减少环境影响。
