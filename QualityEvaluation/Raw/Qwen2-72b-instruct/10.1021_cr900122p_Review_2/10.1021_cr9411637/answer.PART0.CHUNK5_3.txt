1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The literature mainly lists a large number of references related to zeolites and their catalytic properties, but does not provide detailed explanations or descriptions of the specific mechanisms and influencing factors.
