Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps.

The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。Zn-或Ga改性的沸石能有效地催化轻烷烃向芳烃的转化，具有高选择性。金属物种和酸位点在增强轻烷烃向芳烃的转化中的作用仍然是一个有争议的话题。金属物种负责烷烃的脱氢，而Brnsted酸位点则参与烯烃的寡聚和环化。烷烃的CH键的活化和裂解主要发生在Brnsted酸位点。Ga或Zn作为端口，催化H原子的重组解吸，形成二氢（H2）。氢物种的解吸使烯烃的形成平衡向正方向移动，抑制了向烃类物种的氢转移，导致乙烷和甲烷的形成。进一步的烯烃寡聚和脱氢环化产生芳烃物种。烷烃在沸石Brnsted酸位点的活化被假定为独立于沸石中存在的金属物种。Zn对C1n-C4烷烃的H/D氢交换反应有促进作用，显著提高了反应速率，降低了表观活化能。Zn物种的中间参与使烷烃中的CH键更容易和可逆地断裂和形成。在Zn阳离子上的脱氢过程中形成烯烃的中间体，或通过烷烃的解离吸附形成的Zn烷基物种的参与是可能的。从IR研究中得出，烷烃在Zn改性沸石上的吸附可以形成Zn-烷基物种。对于Zn含量高的沸石，Zn烷基物种的形成发生在沸石孔内的小ZnO簇中。在Zn氧化物位点上对氘化烷烃的解离吸附导致Znalkyl物种和ZnOD基团的形成。Znalkyl物种通过沸石的邻近酸性OH基团的质子化，伴随着从ZnOD到沸石酸位点的氘的逆向转移，最终提供了从沸石的SiOHAl基团到氘化烷烃分子的质子转移。该机制也解释了只有C3和n-C4烷烃的甲基基团参与交换的现象。从我们的数据中可以清楚地看出，沸石Brnsted酸位点对小烷烃的CH键的活化依赖于与烷烃形成中间体的Zn物种。可以假设，Znalkyl物种与沸石酸位点的相互作用不仅可以提供H/D交换反应，还可以提供一个脱氢步骤，产生烯烃，用于随后的芳构化步骤。Zn和Brnsted位点在增强芳构化能力方面的协同作用可以通过在Zn位点形成的Zn烷基物种和沸石酸OH基团的参与来实现，以激活烷烃的CH键。涉及沸石酸位点和烷烃和Zn位点的中间体或过渡态导致烷烃的脱氢，可能是通过能量最有利的方式。Zn改性沸石上烷烃向芳烃分子的转化的增强是可以实现的。Zn对催化剂Brnsted酸位点的烷烃CH键的活化的影响被证明是Zn的直接影响。

1. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites, play a significant role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are effective in converting light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is a subject of ongoing debate. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes, catalyzing the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms, which shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization result in aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a significant promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, as demonstrated by an increase in the reaction rates and a decrease in apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by the dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites is confirmed by IR studies and 13C MAS NMR. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. The pathway of H/D exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes involves the formation of Zn-alkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Zn-alkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite, with synchronous reverse transfer of deuterium from the ZnOD to the zeolite acid site, results in the transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The data demonstrate the synergetic action of Zn species and acid sites in the breaking and formation of the CH bonds in alkane during its activation. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Zn-alkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for subsequent aromatization steps. The synergy of the acid and the Zn-sites (as ZnO clusters) for the effective aromatization of small alkanes by Zn-modified zeolites is rationalized by Pathway 2. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability can be achieved by the involvement of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites, leads to alkane dehydrogenation by the energetically most favorable way. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites can be achieved. The effect of Zn, earlier attributed to the dehydrogenation ability of the loaded metal or its ability to afford the recombinative desorption of H atoms, is shown to be the direct influence of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites.

1. 金属基催化剂的组成和结构，如Zn-或Ga改性的沸石，在烷烃转化的机制和效率中扮演着重要角色。这些催化剂在将轻烷烃转化为芳香烃时具有高选择性。金属物种和酸位点在增强轻烷烃转化为芳香烃中的作用仍然是激烈争议的主题。金属物种负责烷烃的脱氢，而Brnsted酸位点则参与烯烃的寡聚和环化。烷烃的CH键的活化和裂解主要发生在Brnsted酸位点。Ga或Zn作为通道，催化氢原子的重组脱附，这将平衡向烯烃的形成方向移动，并抑制氢向烃类物种的转移，导致乙烷和甲烷的生成。进一步的烯烃寡聚和脱氢环化产生芳香族物种。沸石中存在金属物种时，烷烃在Brnsted酸位点的活化被认为是独立的。Zn对C1n-C4烷烃的H/D氢交换反应有显著的促进作用，这体现在反应速率的增加和表观活化能的降低。烷烃中的CH键在Zn物种的中间参与下，更容易且可逆地断裂和形成。Zn对烷烃活化的影响通过烷烃在沸石孔隙内的Zn氧化物物种上的解离吸附来解释，这发生在烷烃与Brnsted酸位点的相互作用之前。在Zn改性的沸石上，通过红外研究和13C MAS NMR确认了烷烃吸附时Zn烷基物种的形成。对于高Zn含量的沸石，Zn烷基物种的形成发生在沸石孔隙内的小ZnO簇中。C1n-C4烷烃的H/D交换途径涉及Zn-烷基物种和ZnOD基团的形成。Zn-烷基物种被沸石的邻近酸性OH基团质子化，伴随着ZnOD向沸石酸位点的反向氘转移，最终导致SiOHAl基团的质子向氘化烷烃分子的转移。该机制解释了C3和n-C4烷烃中仅甲基位点参与交换的现象。数据证明了Zn物种和酸位点在烷烃活化过程中CH键的断裂和形成中的协同作用。小烷烃的CH键在沸石Brnsted酸位点的活化依赖于与烷烃形成中间体的Zn物种。Zn-烷基物种与沸石酸位点的相互作用不仅可以提供H/D交换反应，还可以提供脱氢步骤，产生烯烃，为后续的芳构化步骤提供原料。通过路径2，酸和Zn位点（作为ZnO簇）之间的协同作用为Zn改性沸石有效芳构化小烷烃提供了合理解释。Zn和Brnsted位点在增强芳构化能力方面的协同作用可以通过烷烃CH键活化中沸石酸OH基团和Zn位点上形成的Zn烷基物种的参与来实现。涉及沸石酸位点和烷烃-Zn位点的中间体或过渡态，以最有利的能量方式导致烷烃脱氢。在Zn改性沸石上，烷烃向芳香分子的转化可以实现。Zn的影响，之前归因于负载金属的脱氢能力或其提供H原子重组脱附的能力，被证明是Zn对催化剂Brnsted酸位点活化烷烃CH键的直接影响。

1.Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for converting light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is controversial. Metal species are responsible for dehydrogenation, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. However, it is claimed that the activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes predominantly occurs at Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, which shifts the equilibrium towards olefin formation and suppresses hydrogen transfer, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization result in aromatic species. The activation of alkanes by Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species. Studying H/D exchange on Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites can clarify the role of metal species in the activation of small alkane molecules. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is explained by the dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes interaction with Brnsted acid sites. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species forming an intermediate with the alkane. The intermediate or transition state involving zeolite acid sites and alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites can be achieved. The effect of Zn, previously attributed to dehydrogenation ability or recombinative desorption of H atoms, is shown to be the direct influence of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts' Brnsted acid sites.

1. 锌或镓改性的沸石是有效的催化剂，能够将轻烷烃转化为芳香烃，具有高选择性。金属物种和酸位点在增强轻烷烃转化为芳香烃中的作用存在争议。金属物种负责脱氢，而布伦斯特酸位点则参与烯烃的寡聚化和环化。然而，有人声称，烷烃的CH键的活化和裂解主要发生在布伦斯特酸位点。镓或锌催化H原子的重组解吸，这将平衡转移到烯烃的形成，并抑制氢向烃类物种的转移，导致乙烷和甲烷的生成。进一步的烯烃寡聚化和脱氢环化产生芳香族物种。烷烃由布伦斯特酸位点的活化被假定为独立于沸石中存在的金属物种。在锌或镓改性的沸石上研究H/D交换可以澄清金属物种在小烷烃分子活化中的可能作用。锌对烷烃活化的影响可以通过烷烃在沸石孔隙内的锌氧化物物种上的解离吸附来解释，这发生在与布伦斯特酸位点的相互作用之前。小烷烃的CH键由沸石布伦斯特酸位点的活化依赖于与烷烃形成中间体的锌物种。涉及沸石酸位点和烷烃-锌位点的中间体或过渡状态导致烷烃脱氢。在锌改性的沸石上，烷烃向芳香分子的转化增强可以实现。锌的作用，以前归因于负载金属的脱氢能力和H原子的重组解吸，被证明是锌对催化剂的布伦斯特酸位点活化烷烃CH键的直接影响。

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。Zn-或Ga改性的沸石能有效地催化轻烷烃转化为芳香烃，具有高选择性。金属物种和酸位点在增强轻烷烃转化为芳香烃中的作用仍然是一个激烈争议的主题。金属物种负责烷烃的脱氢，而Brnsted酸位点则参与烯烃的寡聚和环化。烷烃的CH键的活化和裂解主要发生在Brnsted酸位点。Ga或Zn作为端口，催化从酸催化CH键裂解形成的H原子的重组解吸，作为二氢（H2）。氢物种的解吸使平衡向烯烃的形成方向移动，并抑制氢向烃类物种的转移，导致乙烷和甲烷的形成。进一步的烯烃寡聚和脱氢环化产生芳香族物种。在两种情况下，假设沸石酸位点对烷烃的活化独立于沸石中存在的金属物种。在Zn-或Ga改性沸石上应用H/D交换研究可以为澄清金属物种在沸石酸SiOHAl位点作为Brnsted位点活化小烷烃分子中的可能作用提供途径。我们对C1n-C4烷烃与纯酸性和Zn改性沸石BEA和ZSM-5的H/D交换动力学进行了比较分析。这使我们能够澄清在沸石被Zn改性时，烷烃通过Brnsted酸位点活化的重要机制细节。Zn对烷烃活化的影响被合理化为烷烃在沸石孔隙内的Zn氧化物种上的解离吸附，这先于烷烃与Brnsted酸位点的相互作用。交换的活化能对于丙烷和n-丁烷都是107 108 kJmol1。当沸石用Zn改性时，氢交换的图景发生了变化。这些烷烃的甲基组分优先参与交换。虽然对于Zn改性沸石与酸性沸石相比，表观活化能相似或明显较低，但在相同的温度范围内，Zn改性沸石的交换速率明显较高。反应开始的温度阈值降低了50 K。甲烷在H-BEA（138 kJmol1）和H-ZSM-5（118 kJmol1）上的交换活化能与先前在酸性沸石上确定的甲烷和乙烷的活化能相似。当沸石用Zn改性时，甲烷和乙烷的H/D交换速率增加了两个数量级以上。表观活化能降低到8688 kJmol1。反应速率的显著增加和表观活化能的降低表明Zn对C1n-C4烷烃的H/D氢交换反应有促进作用。H/D交换的加速，加上Zn改性沸石的活化能降低，表明烷烃中的CH键在Zn物种的中间参与下更容易和可逆地断裂和形成。在先前的红外研究中，得出结论，在Zn改性沸石上吸附烷烃时，可以形成Zn-烷基物种，我们通过13C MAS NMR对本研究中使用的沸石样品确认了它们的形成。对于Zn含量高的沸石（在我们的案例中为78 wt%），Zn烷基物种的形成可能发生在沸石孔隙内存在的小ZnO簇上。在Zn氧化位点上解离吸附的氘化烷烃，先于H/D交换，导致Znalkyl物种和ZnOD基团。Znalkyl物种通过邻近的沸石酸性OH基团的质子化，伴随着从ZnOD到沸石酸位点的氘的同步逆向转移，最终从沸石的SiOHAl基团向氘化烷烃分子提供质子。这种机制可以为交换提供与纯酸性沸石明显不同的动力学参数。该机制还合理化了仅C3和n-C4烷烃的甲基组分参与交换。因此，这些数据是实验上对Zn物种和酸位点在烷烃活化期间CH键的断裂和形成的协同作用的早期建议的证明。从我们的数据中可以清楚地看出，沸石Brnsted酸位点对小烷烃的CH键的活化取决于与烷烃形成中间体的Zn物种。可以假设，Znalkyl物种与沸石酸位点的相互作用不仅可以提供H/D交换反应，还可以提供脱氢步骤，产生烯烃，用于随后的芳构化步骤。路径2合理化了酸和Zn位点（作为ZnO簇）之间的协同作用，以有效地芳构化小烷烃。Zn和Brnsted位点在增强芳构化能力方面的协同作用可以通过在Zn位点形成的Zn烷基物种和沸石酸OH基团的参与来实现，以活化烷烃CH键。涉及沸石酸位点和烷烃和Zn位点的中间体或过渡态导致烷烃脱氢，可能是通过能量最有利的方式。因此，Zn改性沸石上烷烃向芳香分子的转化可以得到增强。因此，Zn的影响，以前归因于负载金属的脱氢能力或其提供H原子重组解吸的能力，被证明是Zn对催化剂Brnsted酸位点活化烷烃CH键的直接影响。
