[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
[2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology.596"
[4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
[5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
[6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
[7] "In the preparation in an aqueous medium, the following steps for the formation of the precursor can be proposed: Reduction of V205 to a soluble V4+ species; After addition of H3P04 no precipitation occurs, due to the strong acid (while in a basic medium amorphous NH4V02HP04 forms22); Development of a (VO)HPO4.O.5H2O phase, together with another spurious amorphous phase, after complete evaporation of the solvent;516 and Alternatively, formation of the precursor by crystallization of pure (VO)HP04.0.5H20 through addition of water when the solution is highly concentrated (when it is very"
[8] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified."
[9] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19"
[10] "The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."
[11] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."
[12] "Morphology. It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts at the side faces of the (100) plane.2630.31 Catalysts with a higher exposure of the (100) plane, such as those prepared in an organic medium, are therefore less oxidizable."
[13] "Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere."
[14] "Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at lower temperature?-*l"
[15] "Additives. For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperatre."
[16] "It has been found20732733 that different phases present in calcined catalysts can cooperate improving the catalytic behavior."
[17] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
[18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
[19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
[20] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium."
[21] "Therefore, the defects in the (100) crystal plane do not seem to be directly related to the higher activity resulting from organic preparation, and other factors must be taken into consideration to explain the better catalytic perfor- mance."
[22] "According to Kubias et al.,37 during conditioning a transformation of the surf= occurs from a situation where termination with pyrophosphate groups predominates to one where orthophosphate groups predominate,with simultaneous oxidation of to"
[23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
[24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
[25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
[26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

1.The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the crystallites, the type of alcohol used influences the reduction temperature of V5+, and the P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes the active phase. The presence of impurities or certain additives can facilitate the oxidation of the catalyst. Morphology, low-temperature treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere, and the use of specific additives also play a role in the catalyst's performance. Different phases in calcined catalysts can cooperate to improve catalytic behavior. Fresh and equilibrated catalysts have different properties, with the latter having stable V4+ and being less reoxidizable. Defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium may not directly relate to higher activity, and other factors must be considered. A high P/V ratio helps avoid the oxidation of V4+, and a slight excess of phosphorus provides a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability for optimal activity and selectivity. Surface enrichment of phosphorus can hinder the oxidation of the catalyst in the reactant's atmosphere and in air.

1.V-P基催化剂的催化行为受前体制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和条件化前体的方法的影响。制备方法影响结晶体的形态，所用醇的类型影响V5+的还原温度，前体中的P/V比稳定活性相。杂质或某些添加剂的存在可以促进催化剂的氧化。形态、在含氧气氛中低温处理以及特定添加剂的使用也影响催化剂的性能。在煅烧催化剂中，不同的相可以协同作用，以改善催化行为。新鲜催化剂和平衡催化剂具有不同的性质，后者具有稳定的V4+，并且不易被再氧化。在有机介质中制备的非平衡催化剂中的缺陷可能与较高的活性没有直接关系，必须考虑其他因素。高P/V比有助于避免V4+的氧化，而轻微的磷过量提供了还原性和再氧化性之间的平衡，以获得最佳的活性和选择性。表面磷的富集可以防止催化剂在反应物气氛和空气中被氧化。
