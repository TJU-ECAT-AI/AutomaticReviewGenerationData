          [1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
          [8] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified."
          [9] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19 VOPO."
          [10] "The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."
          [11] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."
          [12] "Morphology. It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts at the side faces of the (100) plane."
          [13] "Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere."
          [14] "Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at lower temperature?"
          [15] "Additives. For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperatre."
          [16] "It has been found20732733 that different phases present in calcined catalysts can cooperate improving the catalytic behavior."
          [17] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
          [21] "According to Kubias et al.,37 during conditioning a transformation of the surf= occurs from a situation where termination with pyrophosphate groups predominates to one where orthophosphate groups predominate,with simultaneous oxidation of to"
          [22] "Optimal catalyst composition presents a slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric value of the precursor."
          [23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

          The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

          V-P基催化剂的催化行为受前体制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和条件化前体的方法的影响。制备方法影响(VO)HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态、(001)面的暴露程度以及V5+还原的程度。前体中的P/V比稳定(VO)P207，催化剂的形态影响其氧化性。在含氧气氛中低温处理以及某些添加剂的存在也会影响催化剂的性能。催化剂的条件化会导致表面从以焦磷酸基团为主的情况转变为以正磷酸基团为主的情况。催化剂组成中磷的轻微过量有助于避免V4+的氧化。具有轻微过量磷的催化剂在还原性和再氧化性之间表现出平衡，这对于高活性和选择性是必要的。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够以高选择性选择性地激活石蜡，这对于氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程至关重要。
