[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
[2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology.596"
[4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
[5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
[6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5 which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added.13"
[7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[8] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified. However on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( X P S )  analysis, which indicates a higher P/V ratio at the surface than in the bulk,16 it is possible to suggest that the excess phosphorus is essentially adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate."
[9] "The P/V ratio. P/V ratios in the precursor higher than the stoichiometric amount stabilize (VO)P207 not only in the reactants atmosphere but also for calcination in a i r at high temperature."
[10] "The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."
[11] "It has been proposed that the oxidation of (VO),P207 starts at the side faces of the (100) plane.2630.31 Catalysts with a higher exposure of the (100) plane, such as those prepared in an organic medium, are therefore less oxidizable."
[12] "Low-temperature of treatment in oxygen-containing atmosphere."
[13] "Precursors prepared in an organic medium, thus more defective, transform at lower temperature?-*l"
[14] "For example, the presence of Zn2+ as a promoter avoids the overoxidation of the catalyst at high temperatre."
[15] "It has been found20732733 that different phases present in calcined catalysts can cooperate improving the catalytic behavior."
[16] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
[17] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
[18] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03).37-39 Equilibrated catalysts are no longer reoxidizable in air at 400 O C ,  contrary to a freshly prepared (VO),P,O, or with non- equilibrated catalysts."
[19] "It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation?"
[20] "Even though it is not yet possible to rule out that the defects are responsible for the higher activity of nonequilibrated catalysts,it Seems that their main role may be in directing or facilitating the transformation of the surface of a fresh catalyst (and perhaps a l s o
of the bulk) during the conditioning step to a situation more favorable for the optimal catalytic behavior."
[21] "Therefore, the defects in the (100) crystal plane do not seem to be directly related to the higher activity resulting from organic preparation, and other factors must be taken into consideration to explain the better catalytic perfor- mance."
[22] "According to Kubias et al.,37 during conditioning a transformation of the surf= occurs from a situation where termination with pyrophosphate groups predominates to one where orthophosphate groups predominate,with simultaneous oxidation of to
[23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
[24] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
[25] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

1.The catalytic behavior of vanadium-phosphorus (V-P) based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method, including the type of reagents, reducing agents, solvent, temperature, and milling conditions, can affect the reproducibility of the data. Mechanical strength is enhanced through special treatment, addition of promoters, embedding with pyrophosphates, or encapsulation in silica. The optimum precursor has 0.5 mol of water of crystallization. The morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites can vary, and the type of aliphatic alcohol influences the reduction of V5+. Parameters such as the exposure of the (001) plane, strain in the crystallite, and the extent of reduction of V5+ are influenced by various factors. Excess phosphorus is adsorbed on the surface of the vanadylphosphate. A higher P/V ratio stabilizes the catalyst in the reactants' atmosphere and during calcination at high temperatures. The presence of free V2O5 or additives like Mn2+ facilitates the oxidation of the catalyst. Catalysts with a higher exposure of the (100) plane are less oxidizable. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere is beneficial. Precursors prepared in an organic medium transform at lower temperatures. The presence of promoters like Zn2+ avoids overoxidation at high temperatures. Different phases in calcined catalysts can cooperate to improve catalytic behavior. Fresh catalysts are designated as "nonequilibrated," while those after prolonged use are "equilibrated." Nonequilibrated catalysts are more active but have lower selectivity to maleic anhydride. Equilibrated catalysts have stable V4+ and are not reoxidizable in air at 400°C. Defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation. Defects may facilitate the transformation of the surface during conditioning to a more favorable state for catalytic behavior. The defects in the (100) crystal plane are not directly related to the higher activity from organic preparation. During conditioning, the surface transforms from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of V4+. Excess phosphorus forms a phase on the (100) plane, reducing oxidizability. Surface enrichment of phosphorus hinders the oxidation of the catalyst in the reactant's atmosphere and in air.

1.基于钒磷(V-P)的催化剂的催化行为受前驱体制备方法、P/V比、添加剂的存在以及在高温下激活和条件化方法的影响。制备方法，包括试剂类型、还原剂、溶剂、温度和研磨条件，可能影响数据的可重复性。通过特殊处理、添加促进剂、与焦磷酸盐嵌入或在二氧化硅中封装来增强机械强度。最优前驱体具有0.5 mol的结晶水。(VO) HP04.0.5H20晶体的形态可以变化，而脂肪醇的类型影响V5+的还原。各种因素影响(001)面的暴露、晶粒中的应变以及V5+还原的程度。过量的磷吸附在钒酸盐磷酸盐的表面。较高的P/V比在反应物气氛中和在高温下煅烧时稳定催化剂。自由V2O5的存在或像Mn2+这样的添加剂会促进催化剂的氧化。具有较高(100)面暴露的催化剂氧化性较低。在含氧气氛中低温处理是有益的。在有机介质中制备的前驱体在较低温度下转化。像Zn2+这样的促进剂的存在避免了在高温下过度氧化。在煅烧催化剂中，不同的相可以协同作用，以改善催化行为。新鲜催化剂被指定为“未平衡”，而经过长时间使用的催化剂为“平衡”。未平衡催化剂活性更高，但对马来酸酐的选择性较低。平衡催化剂具有稳定的V4+，在400°C下不会在空气中再氧化。缺陷增加了煅烧催化剂的路易斯酸性，这是丁烷活化所必需的。缺陷可能有助于在条件化过程中表面的转化，以达到更有利于催化行为的状态。在(100)晶面中的缺陷与有机制备带来的较高活性没有直接关系。在条件化过程中，表面从以焦磷酸盐基团为主的情况转变为以正磷酸盐基团为主的情况。较高的P/V比有助于避免V4+的氧化。过量的磷在(100)面上形成一个相，降低了氧化性。磷在表面的富集有助于在反应物气氛和空气中抑制催化剂的氧化。
