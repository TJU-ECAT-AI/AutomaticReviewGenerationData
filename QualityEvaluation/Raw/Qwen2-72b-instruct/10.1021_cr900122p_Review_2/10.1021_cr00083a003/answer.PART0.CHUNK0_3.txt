[3] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(1V) and of vanadium(V)X the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0, the different crystalline (a,p),50,74-82 polymorphic (aI,aII,y, 6),31-333*82 or hydrated phases of V0P0431-33*5074-87 have been extensively studied. In general, the vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers@ or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound."
[4] "The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP0431v33973 Also a-VOP04 r e d u c e   J under less severe conditions compared to those needed to reduce p-VOP04. However, the a-VOP04 can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- f o r m a t i  n .   !"
[5] "The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al.lo3 from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion."
[6] "The results of Contractor et al.,22 Johnson et al.?lJ1l Pepera et al.,129 and Trifirb et a1.60J096J05J30 agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al.22 indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%."
[7] "The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S  h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1."
[8] "The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs."
[9] "The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al.lZ7 studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02,the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons."
[10] "The working state of catalyst under steady-state conditions depends upon the nature of this dynamic interaction.bl.120p130 However,this also offers the possibility of studying the mecha- nism of reaction under steady-state dynamic conditions and analyzing the nature of the products formed as a function of the type of surface modifications induced by the hydrocarbon/Oz interaction."

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with catalyst phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases with increased phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants highlight the different catalyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. The working state of the catalyst under steady-state conditions depends on the nature of the dynamic interaction between the hydrocarbon/oxygen mixture and the catalyst surface, offering the possibility of studying the mechanism of reaction under steady-state dynamic conditions and analyzing the nature of the products formed as a function of the type of surface modifications induced by the hydrocarbon/O2 interaction.

1. 金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。例如，磷钒氧化物（PVO）系统的特点是能够容易地形成和相互转换多种结晶V(IV)和V(V)相，这导致了关于活性相性质的混淆。合成变量，如使用有机溶剂与水系统，影响活性相的结晶度和缺陷结构。活性相的最终P:V比值，这是许多出版物的主题，对反应机制起着关键作用。最近对PVO的固态化学的理解进展，使得能够用特征明确、可重复的组成来研究这种反应，从而更好地分析氧化态、P:V比值和缺陷结构在反应机制中的作用。P:V比值是决定催化剂选择性和活性的关键参数，随着催化剂磷含量的增加，马来酸酐的选择性增加，而特定活性则在0.9-1.2的P:V范围内随着磷含量的增加而降低。磷钒氧化物能够将n-丁烷脱氢为烯烃，这些烯烃随后进一步反应形成部分氧化产物。不同烷烃和烯烃反应物的不同的动力学行为突出了两种反应物诱导的催化剂表面效应的差异。催化剂在稳态条件下的工作状态取决于烃/氧气混合物与催化剂表面之间动态相互作用的性质，这提供了在稳态动态条件下研究反应机制和分析作为表面改性类型函数的产物性质的可能性。
