1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables in the PVO system affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, impacting its performance characteristics and mechanism of catalysis. The use of an organic solvent during preparation, as opposed to an aqueous system, results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase can be varied, and recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism.
2.The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a complex system that performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the abstraction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers, held together by long V-0 bonds or hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of solvated inorganic intercalation compounds.
3.The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tendency to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector to form the columns of edge-sharing octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This transformation is easier than the movement along the crystallographic shear planes proposed for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic performance due to its greater stability compared to other forms of VOP04, limiting its further transformation.
4.The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation. Studies of V/P-mica compounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios have shown that optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion. The catalytic behavior of a- and p-VOP04 phases in n-butane oxidation has been studied, with no significant differences in activities observed between the two phases.
5.The results of various studies agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. It has been indicated that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%.
6.The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity. Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific activity of both selective and nonselective oxidation decreases with an increase in phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. The best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1.
7.The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which react further to form partial oxidation products. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site, intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride, meaning that once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响,特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程。例如,在PVO系统中,钒(IV)和钒(V)的各种结晶相的容易形成和相互转化导致了关于活性相性质的混淆。合成变量影响导致活性催化剂的固态化学,从而影响其性能特性和催化机制。使用有机溶剂进行制备,与使用水系统相比,会导致活性相的不同结晶度和缺陷结构。最近对PVO的固态化学的理解进展使得可以使用特征明确、可重复的组成进行研究,从而更好地分析氧化态、P:V比和缺陷结构对反应机制的作用。
2.n-丁烷转化为马来酸酐的反应是一个复杂系统,涉及14个电子的氧化,包括8个氢原子的抽离和3个氧原子的插入。钒磷氧化物系统的特点是容易形成各种结晶相,包括钒(IV)和钒(V)的结晶相,其中P:V原子比接近1.0的相更有趣。范德磷正磷酸盐的晶体结构由V06和PO4基团组成,这些基团以层状排列,通过长V-0键或氢键连接。层状结构导致丰富的插层化学,形成由交替的无机和有机层组成的层状固体,或形成溶剂化的无机插层化合物。
3.y-VOP04框架的构成层沿Burger向量有协同移动的倾向,以形成(VO)2P207的边缘共享八面体和焦磷酸基团的柱状结构。这种转变比沿p-VOP04的晶体剪切面的移动更容易。a-VOP04在比p-VOP04更温和的条件下还原,但在高温下,特别是在固定床反应器的热点区域,a-VOP04也可以转化为p-VOP04。在用于丁烷氧化的催化剂中,p-VOP04的存在会导致催化性能的损失,因为与VOP04的其他形式相比,它的稳定性更高,限制了其进一步的转化。
4.活性催化剂必须具有V4+/V5+的最优比,以实现n-丁烷氧化的选择性。对V/P-云母化合物进行的研究表明,含有4-9个V(V)离子/个V(IV)离子的催化剂具有最佳的性能特性。a-和p-VOP04相在n-丁烷氧化中的催化行为已被研究,两相之间的活性没有显著差异。
5.各种研究的结果一致认为,范德磷正磷酸盐是n-丁烷氧化中的活性相。已经指出,在没有气相氧的情况下,可以消除非选择性的高活性表面氧物种。使用带有单独的烃-催化剂和氧-催化剂阶段的循环固体反应器,可以将马来酸酐的选择性提高到近80%。
6.P:V比是决定催化剂选择性和活性的关键参数。马来酸酐的选择性随着催化剂磷含量的增加而增加,而选择性和非选择性氧化的具体活性随着0.9-1.2 P:V范围内磷含量的增加而降低。P:V比为1.1的催化剂表现出最佳的催化性能。
7.钒磷氧化物能够将n-丁烷脱氢为烯烃,这些烯烃进一步反应形成部分氧化产物。当向活性位点供应的氧气不足时,中间产物可能会脱附并在其他位点反应。当表面氧浓度较高时,证据支持n-丁烷到马来酸酐的单位点选择性转化机制,即一旦n-丁烷被激活,它将以各种形式保持在表面上,直到作为马来酸酐脱附。
