1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The valence state of vanadium changes based on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation and reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper understanding of the dynamics of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The interaction of C4 hydrocarbons with the catalyst surface results in surface modifications that affect the catalytic behavior. The P:V ratio effect on redox properties and selectivity/activity is interpreted based on two different types of reactions: oxidative dehydrogenation to adsorbed butadiene and further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, while the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. When the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The redox properties of the catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show similar selectivity, but at high conversion, the catalyst with the highest rate of oxidation shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。进料的氧化还原性质影响催化剂表面的氧化状态，进而影响反应中形成的产物的性质。钒的价态根据进料的氧化还原电位、催化剂在反应温度下的氧化和还原速率而变化。对催化剂表面动力学和表面诱导修饰与催化行为之间关系的更深入理解，将有助于更好地理解这些混合氧化物的选择性控制特性。C4烃类与催化剂表面的相互作用导致表面修饰，影响催化行为。P:V比对氧化还原性质和选择性/活性的影响是基于两种不同类型的反应来解释的：氧化脱氢至吸附的丁二烯和进一步氧化这个中间体。第一步由Vw的还原速率控制，而第二步由Vv的量控制。当Vv的含量过高时，氧化进一步进行到碳氧化物。在高转化率下，选择性到马来酸酐与五价钒的形成速率之间存在强烈的关联。催化剂的氧化还原性质取决于制备程序。在低转化率和相似的Vv形成速率下，催化剂显示出相似的选择性，但在高转化率下，氧化速率最高的催化剂显示出最高的马来酸酐分解速率。这些因素对这些催化剂在工业烷烃转化中的重要性有贡献。
