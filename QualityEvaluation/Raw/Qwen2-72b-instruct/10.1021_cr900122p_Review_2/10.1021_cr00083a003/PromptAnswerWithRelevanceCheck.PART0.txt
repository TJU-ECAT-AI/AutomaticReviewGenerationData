The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u .
These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself.
The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction.
The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action.
However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides.
The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate.
The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available.
However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides.
These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V).
The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures.
At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition.

The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(1V) and of vanadium(V)X the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0, the different crystalline (a,p),50,74-82 polymorphic (aI,aII,y, 6),31-333*82 or hydrated phases of V0P0431-33*5074-87 have been extensively studied. In general, the vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers@ or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound.
The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP0431v33973 Also a-VOP04 r e d u c e   J under less severe conditions compared to those needed to reduce p-VOP04. However, the a-VOP04 can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- f o r m a t i  n .   !
The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al.lo3 from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The same authors124-1n have studied the catalytic behavior of a- and p-VOP04 phases in n-bu- tane oxidation. No significant differences in the ac- tivities of the two phases were 0berved.
The results of Contractor et al.,22 Johnson et al.?lJ1l Pepera et al.,129 and Trifirb et a1.60J096J05J30 agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al.22 indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%.
The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S  h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1.
The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables in the PVO system affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, impacting its performance characteristics and mechanism of catalysis. The use of an organic solvent during preparation, as opposed to an aqueous system, results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase can be varied, and recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism.
2.The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a complex system that performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the abstraction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers, held together by long V-0 bonds or hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of solvated inorganic intercalation compounds.
3.The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tendency to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector to form the columns of edge-sharing octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This transformation is easier than the movement along the crystallographic shear planes proposed for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic performance due to its greater stability compared to other forms of VOP04, limiting its further transformation.
4.The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation. Studies of V/P-mica compounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios have shown that optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion. The catalytic behavior of a- and p-VOP04 phases in n-butane oxidation has been studied, with no significant differences in activities observed between the two phases.
5.The results of various studies agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. It has been indicated that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%.
6.The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity. Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific activity of both selective and nonselective oxidation decreases with an increase in phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. The best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1.
7.The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which react further to form partial oxidation products. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site, intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride, meaning that once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs.

Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02,the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.
The working state of catalyst under steady-state conditions depends upon the nature of this dynamic interaction.bl.120p130 However,this also offers the possibility of studying the mecha- nism of reaction under steady-state dynamic conditions and analyzing the nature of the products formed as a function of the type of surface modifications induced by the hydrocarbon/Oz interaction.

The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the catalyst's oxidation states, P:V ratio, and defect structure. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, which can lead to a rich intercalation chemistry. The presence of different crystalline phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affects the catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less active and more stable, limiting its further transformation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation, with optimal performance associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation is supported by several studies, indicating that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective, increasing the selectivity to maleic anhydride. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with catalyst phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases on increase of phosphorus content.

The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. The working state of the catalyst under steady-state conditions depends on the dynamic interaction between the hydrocarbon/oxygen mixture and the catalyst surface, offering the possibility of studying the mechanism of reaction under steady-state dynamic conditions and analyzing the nature of the products formed as a function of the type of surface modifications induced by the hydrocarbon/O2 interaction. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u .
These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself.
The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction.
The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action.
However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides.
The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate.
The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available.
However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides.
These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V).
The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures.
At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The valence state of vanadium changes based on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation and reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper understanding of the dynamics of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The interaction of C4 hydrocarbons with the catalyst surface results in surface modifications that affect the catalytic behavior. The P:V ratio effect on redox properties and selectivity/activity is interpreted based on two different types of reactions: oxidative dehydrogenation to adsorbed butadiene and further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, while the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. When the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The redox properties of the catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show similar selectivity, but at high conversion, the catalyst with the highest rate of oxidation shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(1V) and of vanadium(V)X the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0, the different crystalline (a,p),50,74-82 polymorphic (aI,aII,y, 6),31-333*82 or hydrated phases of V0P0431-33*5074-87 have been extensively studied. In general, the vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers@ or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound.
The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP0431v33973 Also a-VOP04 r e d u c e J under less severe conditions compared to those needed to reduce p-VOP04. However, the a-VOP04 can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- f o r m a t i n . !
The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al.lo3 from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion.
The results of Contractor et al.,22 Johnson et al.?lJ1l Pepera et al.,129 and Trifirb et a1.60J096J05J30 agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al.22 indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%.
The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1.
In the C4 alkene oxidation an interesting effect is oberved.'JJ'@ On increasing the hydrocarbon con- centration, the formation of maleic anhydride reaches a maximum and then decreases with a corresponding increase in the formation of butadiene. An increase in oxygen partial pressure while keeping butene constant causes an increase in the formation of maleic anhydride.The olefin concentration corresponding to the value of the maximum maleic anhydride shifts to higher values on increase of oxygen concentration. Similar results are found in butadiene oxidation. Also a self-inhibition effect of the hydrocarbon on the synthesis of the maleic anhydride and an almost linear dependence of the self-inhibition effect upon the O2 concentration are observed.
The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al.lZ7 studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02,the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.
Variations of the oxidation state of the catalyst under the aforementioned three conditions are also shown by the diffuse reflectance spectra136 in the UV-vis region (Figure 12). Results from the surface interaction with the hydrocarbon/oxygen mixture carried out as a function of the relative concentration of hydrocarbon and oxygen parallel those b t a i n e d ' by varying the reaction temperature at a fixed concentration. An increase of the but-1-ene/oxygen ratio results'39 in a decrease of the rate of maleic anhydride formation and an increase of the rate of butadiene formation (Figure 13) with a corresponding disappearance of Vv and re- duction to produce v''. An increase in the oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and of the rate of maleic anhydride formation.
When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, can result in different degrees of crystallinity and defect structures in the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase can be varied, affecting the oxidation states, P:V ratio, and defect structure, which in turn influence the reaction mechanism. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry due to its layered structure, which can lead to the formation of layered solids with alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and transformation of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, under various reaction conditions can impact catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation has been identified, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by several studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants differ, with the oxidation of but-1-ene leading to higher incorporation of lattice oxygen in the products compared to n-butane, indicating different reactivity and interaction types. The oxidation state of the catalyst can be influenced by the relative concentration of hydrocarbon and oxygen, affecting the rate of maleic anhydride and butadiene formation. The efficiency of alkane transformations is thus closely tied to the dynamic interaction between the hydrocarbon/oxygen mixture and the catalyst surface, which can lead to self-induced modifications in catalytic behavior. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition.

The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase.23 In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- 0009-2665/88/0788-0055$06.50/0 0 1988 American Chemical Society 56 Chemical Reviews, 1988.

The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(1V) and of vanadium(V)X the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0, the different crystalline (a,p),50,74-82 polymorphic (aI,aII,y, 6),31-333*82 or hydrated phases of V0P0431-33*5074-87 have been extensively studied. In general, the vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers@ or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound.
The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP0431v33973 Also a-VOP04 r e d u c e J under less severe conditions compared to those needed to reduce p-VOP04. However, the a-VOP04 can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- f o r m a t i n . !
The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al.lo3 from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion.
The results of Contractor et al.,22 Johnson et al.?lJ1l Pepera et al.,129 and Trifirb et a1.60J096J05J30 agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al.22 indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%.
The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1.
The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs.
In the C4 alkene oxidation an interesting effect is oberved.'JJ'@ On increasing the hydrocarbon con- centration, the formation of maleic anhydride reaches a maximum and then decreases with a corresponding increase in the formation of butadiene. An increase in oxygen partial pressure while keeping butene constant causes an increase in the formation of maleic anhydride.The olefin concentration corresponding to the value of the maximum maleic anhydride shifts to higher values on increase of oxygen concentration. Similar results are found in butadiene oxidation. Also a self-inhibition effect of the hydrocarbon on the synthesis of the maleic anhydride and an almost linear dependence of the self-inhibition effect upon the O2 concentration are observed.
The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al.lZ7 studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02,the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.
