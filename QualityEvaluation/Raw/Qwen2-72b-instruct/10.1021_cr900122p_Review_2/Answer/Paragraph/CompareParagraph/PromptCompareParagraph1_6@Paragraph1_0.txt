Metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium oxides, are pivotal in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The efficiency of these catalysts is intricately linked to the aggregation state of metal cations, acid-base properties, valence state, and electronic characteristics \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is significantly influenced by the loading of V2O5, with optimal rates observed on mid-sized VOx domains \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Selectivity peaks at intermediate active phase loads, with both isolated and polymerized V species contributing to activity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\].
