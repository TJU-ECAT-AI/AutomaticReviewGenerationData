          "[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."
          "[3] The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed [26]."
          "[4] The objective of the present work is, for that rea- son, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium load- ings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium."
          "[5] The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination,reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading."
          "[6] The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
          "[7] It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."
          "[8] The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."

          The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

          表面钒氧化物的分子结构和催化性能受制备方法、支撑物性质、促进剂和环境条件的影响。根据钒的负载量，不同的V5+钒氧化物物种在氧化铝表面形成，较低覆盖度下主要为孤立和聚合的VO4单元，而较高负载量下主要为VO6八面体。丙烷的氧化脱氢是一个强烈的放热反应，在催化床中使用浓缩进料时，观察到约873 K或更高的最大温度。研究重点是高温和高钒负载条件下，在氧化铝支撑上形成的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性，以及相组成、配位、还原性和分散性与催化性能之间的关系。具有最高分散度的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种可获得最高的丙烯选择性。孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的，而AlVO4相和类体V2O5只有低催化活性。以AlVO4形式存在的钒的份额随钒负载量的增加而增加。
