          The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.

          The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

          将甲烷催化转化为所需的化学产品或液体燃料是利用天然气资源的一种有前途的方法，但对催化科学来说也是一个巨大的挑战。Mo改性的ZSM-5催化剂在973 K的非氧化条件下，对甲烷转化为苯显示出优异的催化活性和选择性。在ZSM-5中加入Mo或Zn对甲烷的活化起着重要作用。随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产量也随之增加。金属基催化剂的组成和结构,如含有Mo或Zn的改性ZSM-5沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。通过添加金属阳离子,如Mo或Zn,可以增强ZSM-5的催化活性,在非氧化条件下促进甲烷的脱氢和芳构化。反应条件,包括温度和存在碳正离子机制,通过使甲烷转化为苯具有高选择性和稳定性,为这些催化剂的工业意义做出了贡献。这些因素促成了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。
