          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.
