          [1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [2] "This paper discusses the current fundamental information available about the structure and reactivity of surface vanadia species on oxide supports: monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer,oxidation state of the surface vanadia species, molecular structures of the surface vanadia species (as a function of environment and catalyst composition), acidity of the surface vanadia species and reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [3] "Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase."
          [4] "The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are also discussed."
          [5] "The surface vanadia monolayer is stable after its initial formation on many typical oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2)."
          [6] "The surface vanadia monolayer on oxide supports is also stable under reducing and reaction environ- ments."
          [7] "The stability of the surface vanadia monolayers is reflected in the long life of such industrial oxidation catalysts."
          [8] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively investigated in the past few years with many different spectroscopies."
          [9] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."
          [10] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species."
          [11] "The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible."
          [12] "Exposure of the surface vanadia (5+) species to reducing H2 and CO environ- ments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species."
          [13] "Direct information about the molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be obtained from in situ EPR for isolated V(4+) [2,47,57], and UV- VIS DRS measurements for V(4+,3+) [47,56,57] and XANES/EXAFS for V(4+,3) (no known studies at this point)."
          [14] "The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments upon the oxida- tion states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions with in situ Raman spectroscopy."
          [15] "The in situ Raman studies provide new insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the dehydrated V(5) surface vanadia species appears to be the predominant surface vanadia species, (2) the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species depends on the reducing power of the hydrocarbon (methanol> butene>butane>methane), (3) the specific oxide support and (4) the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species (polymerized>isolated)."
          [16] "The greater stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be directly related to the fact that only isolated surface vanadia species are present in this catalyst."
          [17] "The influence of preparation methods upon the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has also been examined."
          [18] "The same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method."
          [19] "The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support upon the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species on well-defined TiO2 supports (anatase, rutile, brookite and B) was investigated with solid state 51V NMR and Raman spectroscopy."
          [20] "The same dehydrated surface vanadia species, already discussed above in Section 5.1.2, were found to be present on all the different TiO2 modifications suggesting that there is no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate upon the local structure of the surface vanadia species."
          [21] "The oxide supports only possess surface Lewis acid sites and the relative strength of these sites is A12Oa>Nb2Os>TiO2>ZrO2, and no surface Lewis acid sites are detected for SiO2."
          [22] "In contrast to the oxide supports, unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites."
          [23] "The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites."
          [24] "The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is not clear at present since solid state 1H NMR studies cannot clearly discriminate between different locations due to similar NMR peak positions."
          [25] "The acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand, but the molecular structural characterization studies above (see Section 3) reveal that the same dehydrated surface vanadia species are present on all the oxide supports (with the exception of silica)."
          [26] "The in situ characterization studies (Section 5.5) revealed that dehydrated surface vanadia species are present during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions and, consequently, the reactivity properties need to be related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species."
          [27] "The reactivity properties of the supported vanadia catalysts will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species."
          [28] "The terminal V=O bonds have been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4]."
          [29] "The available data suggests that the terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [30] "The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage due to the increase in the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species with the exception of V205]SiO 2 (see Section 5.1 above)."
          [31] "Although the bridging V-O-V bonds do not appear to significantly influence many of the oxidation reactions, more systematic studies with well-defined model supported vanadia catalysts are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [32] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [33] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."
          [34] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity,are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."
          [35] "In general, reactions requiring only one surface site will exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage."
          [36] "The invariance of the TOF for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde with surface vanadia coverage over supported vanadia catalysts suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction."
          [37] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."
          [41] "The introduction of surface niobia species to V2Os/TiO2 catalysts increases the TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [42] "This increase in TOF reflects the requirement of multiple surface metal oxide sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction."
          [43] "Interacting additives and especially interacting basic surface oxides retard the reduction of surface vanadia species."
          [44] "Consequently, the TOFs for all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are decreased when basic additives are intro- duced."
          [45] "The negative effect of the basic additives on the TOFs for methanol oxidation and propane oxidation over V2Os/TiO2 catalysts have been reported in the literature [59,99]."
          [46] "In the case of V205/SIO2, the situation is even more drastic since the basic metal oxide additives also convert the two-dimensional surface vanadia species to three-dimensional crystalline mixed metal oxide phases [100]."
          [47] "Interacting acidic additives such as P may have a different effect on various oxidation reactions."
          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst.

The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found.

The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.
