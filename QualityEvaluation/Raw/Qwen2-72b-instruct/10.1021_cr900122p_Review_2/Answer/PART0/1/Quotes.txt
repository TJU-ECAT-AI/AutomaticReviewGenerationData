[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
          [3] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."
          [4] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
          [5] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
          [6] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
          [7] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
          [8] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
          [9] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
          [10] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [11] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."

          [13] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
          [14] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
          [15] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
          [16] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
          [17] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [18] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
          [19] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
          [20] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [21] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."
          [22] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
          [23] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."

          [26] "Propane ODH turnover rates decreases monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li)."
          [27] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
          [28] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [31] "Although the bridging V-O-V bonds do not appear to significantly influence many of the oxidation reactions, more systematic studies with well-defined model supported vanadia catalysts are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [32] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [33] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."
          [34] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity,are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."
          [35] "In general, reactions requiring only one surface site will exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage."
          [36] "The invariance of the TOF for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde with surface vanadia coverage over supported vanadia catalysts suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction."
          [37] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

          [46] "In the case of V205/SIO2, the situation is even more drastic since the basic metal oxide additives also convert the two-dimensional surface vanadia species to three-dimensional crystalline mixed metal oxide phases [100]."
          [47] "Interacting acidic additives such as P may have a different effect on various oxidation reactions."
          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."

          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."



[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH."
          [5] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."
          [6] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [7] "The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported (718), with somewhat inconsistent results."
          [8] "The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies."
          [9] "Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant."
          [10] "We have combined this analysis with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants,which characterize the function of these catalytic materials."
          [11] "In addition, we contrast the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes."
          [12] "As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2."
          [13] "Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities (8 V/nm2)."
          [14] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [15] "The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity."
          [16] "High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [29] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH."
          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."
          [36] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
          "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."
          "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
          "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
          "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."

          [17] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."

          [23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
          [4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
          [6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."



[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies."

"[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination.

          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis- persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
          [9] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."

          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[1] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."
          [2] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."
          [3] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance."
          [4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
          [5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
          [6] "Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
          [7] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."
          [10] "The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for a better understanding of the reaction and for process development."
          [11] "The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          [3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
          [9] "The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent."
          [10] "If a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering thesurfaceofthesupportshouldneed4.98 × 1014molecules V2O5 cm2, the appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoret- ical monolayer (14)."

          [3] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

          [6] "With regard to the type of active oxygen species in the reaction, we find that only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction."
          [7] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

          [4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
          [5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
          [6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
          [7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
          [8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."

          [14] "If Fe-NaZSM-5 has been used as a catalyst, then the methanol producing reaction is much faster than that carbon dioxide generating. However, methanol oxidises to for- maldehyde and then to carbon dioxide more rapidly than in the case of the reaction with Fe-HZSM-5 applied as a catalyst."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
          [3] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."

          [5] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
          [6] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
          [7] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
          [8] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
          [9] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
          [10] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
          [11] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."

          [16] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
          [17] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
          [18] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
          [19] "The main drawback of these systems is that they do not always maintain the structure if high V contents are incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the reaction."
          [20] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
          [21] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."

          [23] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."

          [27] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
          [28] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [31] "Although the bridging V-O-V bonds do not appear to significantly influence many of the oxidation reactions, more systematic studies with well-defined model supported vanadia catalysts are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [32] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [33] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."
          [34] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity,are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."
          [35] "In general, reactions requiring only one surface site will exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage."
          [36] "The invariance of the TOF for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde with surface vanadia coverage over supported vanadia catalysts suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction."
          [37] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."
          [41] "The introduction of surface niobia species to V2Os/TiO2 catalysts increases the TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [36]."

          [46] "In the case of V205/SIO2, the situation is even more drastic since the basic metal oxide additives also convert the two-dimensional surface vanadia species to three-dimensional crystalline mixed metal oxide phases [100]."
          [47] "Interacting acidic additives such as P may have a different effect on various oxidation reactions."
          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."



[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH."
          [5] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."
          [6] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [7] "The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported (718), with somewhat inconsistent results."
          [8] "The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies."
          [9] "Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant."
          [10] "We have combined this analysis with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants,which characterize the function of these catalytic materials."
          [11] "In addition, we contrast the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes."
          [12] "As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2."
          [13] "Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities (8 V/nm2)."
          [14] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [15] "The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity."
          [16] "High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [27] "Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels."
          [28] "The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH."
          [29] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH."
          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."
          [36] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
          "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."
          "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
          "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
          "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
          [8] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified."
          [9] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19 VOPO."

          [11] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."

          [17] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."

          [22] "Optimal catalyst composition presents a slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric value of the precursor."
          [23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
          [4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
          [6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."



[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies."

"[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination.

          [3] "The conversion of methane into organic com- pounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance."
          [4] "This is due to the large nat- ural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component."
          [5] "Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key compo- nent in a number of synthetic organic methods."
          [6] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its in- teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
          [7] "It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts,the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octa- hedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis- persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
          [9] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."

          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[1] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."
          [2] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."
          [3] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance."
          [4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
          [5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
          [6] "Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
          [7] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."
          [10] "The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for a better understanding of the reaction and for process development."
          [11] "The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          [3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."

          [6] "With regard to the type of active oxygen species in the reaction, we find that only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction."
          [7] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [32] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [33] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

          [37] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."

          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."



[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
          [4] "The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH."
          [5] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."
          [6] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [7] "The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported (718), with somewhat inconsistent results."
          [8] "The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies."
          [9] "Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant."
          [10] "We have combined this analysis with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants,which characterize the function of these catalytic materials."
          [11] "In addition, we contrast the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes."
          [12] "As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2."
          [13] "Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities (8 V/nm2)."
          [14] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [15] "The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity."
          [16] "High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [29] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH."
          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."
          [36] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
          "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."
          "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
          "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
          "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
          [8] "The localization of this excess phosphorus in the precursor has not yet been clarified."
          [9] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19 VOPO."

          [11] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."

          [17] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."
          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."

          [23] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"
          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
          [4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
          [6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."



[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies."

"[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination.

          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis- persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
          [9] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."

          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."

          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [32] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dra- matically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [33] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson elec- tronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."



[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

          [8] "The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies."
          [9] "Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
          "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."

          "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
          "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."

          [11] "Minimization of impurities. The presence of free V2o5,l9 even in traces, or of additives such as Mn2+,22 facilitates the oxidation of the vanadylpyro- phosphate also in the reactant mixture."

          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."

          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
          [4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
          [6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."



[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies."

"[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination.

          [22] "On account of the specific activity of these iso- lated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re- spect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[1] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."
          [2] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."
          [3] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance."
          [4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
          [5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
          [6] "Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
          [7] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."
          [10] "The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for a better understanding of the reaction and for process development."
          [11] "The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          [3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
          [9] "The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent."
          [10] "If a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering thesurfaceofthesupportshouldneed4.98 × 1014molecules V2O5 cm2, the appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoret- ical monolayer (14)."

          [3] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."

          [11] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [43] "Interacting additives and especially interacting basic surface oxides retard the reduction of surface vanadia species."
          [44] "Consequently, the TOFs for all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are decreased when basic additives are intro- duced."
          [45] "The negative effect of the basic additives on the TOFs for methanol oxidation and propane oxidation over V2Os/TiO2 catalysts have been reported in the literature [59,99]."
          [46] "In the case of V205/SIO2, the situation is even more drastic since the basic metal oxide additives also convert the two-dimensional surface vanadia species to three-dimensional crystalline mixed metal oxide phases [100]."
          [47] "Interacting acidic additives such as P may have a different effect on various oxidation reactions."
          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."



[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

          [8] "The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies."
          [9] "Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant."
          [10] "We have combined this analysis with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants,which characterize the function of these catalytic materials."
          [11] "In addition, we contrast the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes."
          [12] "As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2."

          [14] "The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces."
          [15] "The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [29] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH."
          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."
          "A catalytic issue relates to the nature of the cationic clusters. Are the alkanes activated by isolated cations, or do the extraframework oxygen atoms also play a role?"
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."

          "Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1)."
          "The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."

          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."
          [20] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning,but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."

          [24] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."
          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
          [4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
          [6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."



[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."
          [2] "The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies."

"[1] Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
          "[2] Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination.

          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."
          [19] "A new catalyst for the MPO reaction has been ob- tained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
          [20] "This reaction takes place between the reactive acid hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the basic acetylacetonate ligands."
          [21] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water,isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."
          [22] "On account of the specific activity of these iso- lated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re- spect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

          [7] "It appears [ 121 that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner,but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[1] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."
          [2] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."
          [3] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance."
          [4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
          [5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
          [6] "Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
          [7] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."
          [10] "The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for a better understanding of the reaction and for process development."
          [11] "The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          [3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
          [9] "The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent."

[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
          [2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

          [11] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."

          [27] "These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction of Mo centers, proceed more slowly."
          [28] "The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene."

The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

          [37] "The oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over V205/ SiO2 catalysts also exhibits a constant TOF with surface vanadia coverage suggesting that only one surface vanadia site is involved with this reaction, and is consistent with the isolated nature of the surface vanadia species on silica [35]."
          [38] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity,influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."
          [39] "Some of these other factors can be discriminated with the addition of metal oxide additives to the supported vanadia catalysts as discussed below."
          [40] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."
          [41] "The introduction of surface niobia species to V2Os/TiO2 catalysts increases the TOF for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [36]."
          [42] "This increase in TOF reflects the requirement of multiple surface metal oxide sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction."
          [43] "Interacting additives and especially interacting basic surface oxides retard the reduction of surface vanadia species."
          [44] "Consequently, the TOFs for all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions are decreased when basic additives are intro- duced."
          [45] "The negative effect of the basic additives on the TOFs for methanol oxidation and propane oxidation over V2Os/TiO2 catalysts have been reported in the literature [59,99]."
          [46] "In the case of V205/SIO2, the situation is even more drastic since the basic metal oxide additives also convert the two-dimensional surface vanadia species to three-dimensional crystalline mixed metal oxide phases [100]."
          [47] "Interacting acidic additives such as P may have a different effect on various oxidation reactions."
          [48] "For methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, the presence of surface phosphate species slightly decreases the TOF [59]."
          [49] "However, for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the presence of surface phosphate species increases the TOF [36]."
          [50] "The surface niobia species, a noninteracting additive possessing Lewis acidity [75], has no effect on the selectivity of formaldehyde during methanol oxidation [59], but does have a positive effect on the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation [36]."
          [51] "The formaldehyde selectivity during methanol oxidation is slightly enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives and decreased by the presence of acidic interacting additives [59]."
          [52] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."
          [53] "In contrast, the maleic anhydride selectivity during butane oxidation is enhanced by the presence of acidic interacting additives [36]."
          [54] "It is tempting to conclude from this limited data that the selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and propane to propylene, is enhanced by basic additives and that the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction-oxygen insertion reactions, butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, is enhanced by acidic additives."
          [55] "However, many more hydrocarbon oxidation reactions need to be examined before these observations can be general- ized."
          [56] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reac- tivity of the surface vanadia species."
          [57] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reac- tant molecule."
          [58] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [59] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [60] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [61] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydro- carbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

          [2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
          [3] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

          [19] "The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities."
          [20] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
          [21] "VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species."
          [22] "The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form."
          [23] "The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds."
          [24] "The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density (1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH."

          [30] "However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane."
          [31] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."
          [32] "The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state."
          [33] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density."
          [34] "The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases."
          [35] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density."

"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."
          "An additional appealing example is the incorporation of methane into gasoline products in the MTG process over Ga/HZSM-5."

          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "According to this reaction scheme, GaO+ can be stabilized by addition of steam."
          "The increased dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is obvious from the increased amount of hydrogen formed."

[1] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
          [2] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
          [3] "The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Z r and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."
          [4] "The optimum precursor is the phase with 0.5 mol of water of crystallization?"
          [5] "The main difference ob- served in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."
          [6] "The type of aliphatic alcohol influences the temperature of reduction of V 5+ which is kinetically controlled and complete only when benzyl alcohol (which forms benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) is utilized, when a long reduction time is used, and when the phosphoric acid is added."
          [7] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."

          [18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of !f+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
          [19] "One of the main properties of an equilibrated catalyst is the presence of stable V4+ (average oxidation degree 4 . 0 0 to 4.03)."

          [25] "According to Matsuura and Yamazaki?6 the excess phosphorus avoids the oxidation of the catalysts by forming on the side faces of the (100) plane a (V0)(P03)2 phase, characterized by a lower oxidizability."
          [26] "T  i f i r b has suggested that the surface enrichment of phosphorus (as found by means of X P S  and SIMS analyis'') helps in hindering the oxidation of (V0),P2O, both in the reactant's atmosphere and in air."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
          [3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
          [5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

          [13] "The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample."
          [14] "Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra."
          [15] "This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
          [16] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."
          [19] "A new catalyst for the MPO reaction has been ob- tained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
          [20] "This reaction takes place between the reactive acid hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the basic acetylacetonate ligands."
          [21] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water,isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."
          [22] "On account of the specific activity of these iso- lated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re- spect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

          [7] "It appears [ 121 that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner,but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is not only a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resource but also a great challenge to catalysis science.
          The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions.
          The Mo or Zn loaded in the ZSM-5 played a significant role in methane activation.
          The yield of benzene increased with increasing partial pressure of methane.
          The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
          The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
          A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.



[1] "On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn21 and Ga11 cations"
          [2] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
          [3] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
          [4] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
          [5] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak."
          [6] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
          [7] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."
          [8] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."



[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
          [2] "X-ray diffrac- tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2."
          [3] "Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases."
          [4] "Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2."
          [5] "UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports."
          [6] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con- centration."
          [7] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces- sibility to reactants."
          [8] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."
          [9] "Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5."
          [10] "The relative rates of oxidative dehydro- genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur- face density or structure."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."
          [2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
          [3] "Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."
          [4] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [5] "ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences of selectivity upon space velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2)."
          [6] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the relatively high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration with increasing space velocity, thus moving the equilibrium in the direction of BTX formation."
          [7] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."
          [8] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions,were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium),121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium),104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium),120t15 kJ mol-'."
          [9] "Over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
          [10] "The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains a matter for conjecture."
          [11] "However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR."
          [12] "We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms."
          [13] "As pointed out in the previous discussion,aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."
          [14] "We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming dehydrogenation process is in quasi-equilibrium (while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity over the two catalysts."
          [15] "The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts,particularly ZSM-5-Zn,may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products."

[1] "Effects of pretreatments on state of gallium and aromatization activity of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts"
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without additional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
          [4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [5] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C."
          [6] "However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [7] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."
          [8] "Keywords: Aromatization,gallium,zeolites,ZSM-5."
          [9] "Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and selective for propane aromatization."
          [10] "This conclusion is based upon the obser- vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment [ 1,2]; (2) we were unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction [2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( NOs),/H-ZSM-5 impregnated materials"
          [11] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydro- genation [5-81."
          [12] "High surface area GazO, and steamed gallosilicates by them- selves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C [ 7,8]."
          [13] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [14] "In order to distinguish more clearly the effects of various pretreatment cliques on catalyst performance,we have also tested various preparations of Ga/ZSM-5 for the dehyogenation of ethane."
          [15] "In order to give high yields to aromatics,rhenium,platinum,or rhodium are often added to the catalysts in small amounts."
          [16] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

[1] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics."
          [2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products."
          [3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."
          [4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
          [5] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps."
          [6] "Ga and Zn sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking."
          [7] "The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increase aromatic turnover rates and actually decrease cracking turnover rates."
          [8] "Ga and Zn species catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in an acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction occurring as a first step in every dehydrogenation event required for an aromatization turnover."
          [9] "Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
          [10] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

"[1] "The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy- drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite." [2] "The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond (RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium activation (RdHd)." [3] "The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma- tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation." [4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group." [5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively." [6] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."

[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
          [2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
          [3] "The nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
          [5] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
          [6] "Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
          [7] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[1] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."
          [2] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."
          [3] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance."
          [4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
          [5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
          [6] "Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
          [7] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
          [8] "The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changed the acid sites of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites."
          [9] "The mode of methane activation continues to be the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed."
          [10] "The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for a better understanding of the reaction and for process development."
          [11] "The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."
          [2] "The vana- dium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3- supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."
          [3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."
          [4] "In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane."
          [5] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."
          [6] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."
          [7] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
          [8] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
          [9] "The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent."
          [10] "If a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering thesurfaceofthesupportshouldneed4.98 × 1014molecules V2O5 cm2, the appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoret- ical monolayer (14)."
          [11] "At lower vanadium loadings, isolated and/or associated tetrahedral and/or octahedral V5+ species have been observed."

[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."
          [2] "The catalytic activation of CH bonds is of fundamental interest, because it is the crucial step in important technological processes and also in many enzymatic reactions."
          [3] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."
          [4] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."
          [5] "The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol (or propene) formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites."
          [6] "With regard to the type of active oxygen species in the reaction, we find that only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction."
          [7] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

[1] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."
          [2] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
          [3] "Fe-ZSM-5 consists of spherulitic aggregates. No differences in shape were observed for all the samples."
          [4] "The XRD powder patterns of the prepared Fe-HZSM-5 catalyst are presented. All the patterns of prepared zeolites exhibit the typical lines for the zeolite type ZSM-5. However, the obtained line intensities differ depending on the Fe content."
          [5] "The splitting of the reflection at 2u = 45.5 (Fig. 3) increases with increasing Si/Fe which, by analogy with the Si/Al systems consistent with the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites."
          [6] "The highest methane conversion amounting to 31.51% was reached while Fe-HZSM-5 with the largest iron content was applied. Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion."
          [7] "Introducing the sodium form of molecular sieves led to the rise in the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates."
          [8] "The highest selectivity of methane to methanol oxidation (about 74%) was attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
          [9] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion."
          [10] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."
          [11] "Methanol is produced over Fe-ZSM-5 at temperature 350 8C."
          [12] "The raise of temperature reduces methanol concentration in products because of its oxidation to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
          [13] "If Fe-HZSM-5 is applied, the oxidation of methane to methanol and to carbon dioxide follow the same speed pattern. Next, methanol slowly oxidises to formaldehyde and then to carbon dioxide."
          [14] "If Fe-NaZSM-5 has been used as a catalyst, then the methanol producing reaction is much faster than that carbon dioxide generating. However, methanol oxidises to for- maldehyde and then to carbon dioxide more rapidly than in the case of the reaction with Fe-HZSM-5 applied as a catalyst."
