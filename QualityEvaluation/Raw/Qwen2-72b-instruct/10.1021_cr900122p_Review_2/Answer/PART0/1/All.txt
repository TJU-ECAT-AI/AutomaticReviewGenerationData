Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。影响催化剂性能的重要特征包括金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随着V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢期间，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化期间，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。表面还原影响丙烯形成的选择性：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。使用N2O代替O2会导致更还原和更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。载体对钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢中的反应性的作用已被广泛研究。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是由于在较低的钒酸盐负载下，平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低。VOx域的还原和催化性质可以显著受到二元分散结构的形成的影响。丙烯的选择性也可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，以一种前体状态供给催化活性VOx位点，用于丙烷活化为丙烯。使用不同的金属氧化物，周转率反映了CH键断裂活化能，这些活化能受到这些金属氧化物的还原性的影晌。添加剂修改了负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的增加选择性的顺序遵循增加的碱性和增加的MO键能的顺序。载体的碱性可能极大地影响选择性。使用碱性金属氧化物载体由于可能快速脱附电子丰富的丙烯产物，从而避免进一步燃烧为COx，从而提高了选择性。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的一个重要因素。一般来说，基于负载型钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随着Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并且对于具有4.5 Mo/nm2的样品达到最大值，这反映了表面Mo物种反应性的增加。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱性氧化物的碱性增加而单调下降。这些碱性氧化物通过增强MoO键来抑制MoOx的初始还原；结果，涉及Mo中心局部还原的决定速率的CH键活化步骤进行得更慢。二次丙烯燃烧的更强抑制反映了当用碱性掺杂剂改性时Mo位点的较弱Lewis酸性；这解释了对丙烯的更高选择性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Chinese": "所有答案结果中的汇总中文答案 1", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites.

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.", "Chinese": "金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00423-8"},
