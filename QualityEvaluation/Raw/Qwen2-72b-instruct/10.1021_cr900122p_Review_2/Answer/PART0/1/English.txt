The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of the active sites, the acidity, and the pore structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to activate and transform light alkanes into more valuable products, such as aromatics and isomers, under mild conditions. The efficiency of these transformations is enhanced by optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction conditions, which can lead to higher yields and selectivities. Moreover, the development of novel regeneration methods for these catalysts can help to mitigate deactivation and extend their operational life, further enhancing their industrial application.

The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with a wide range of vanadia surface densities and structures were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are about eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for oxidative dehydrogenation are similar for both reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of the rate constant for alkene combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. Previous studies on the effects of vanadia surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation have yielded inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on vanadia/alumina samples with a wide range of vanadia surface densities was reported, contrasting the results with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of the catalysts to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants that characterize the function of these catalytic materials. The reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were also contrasted. As the surface density increases, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates per vanadium atom are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density, reaching a maximum at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acid-base properties of the vanadia and support surfaces. The local structure of supported vanadia domains strongly influences oxidative dehydrogenation reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of vanadia surface density and structure on ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities have been previously reported with inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis, as well as the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions at high temperatures and conversions in many previous studies, have contributed to ongoing controversies. The spectroscopic results suggest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx species exceeding monolayer coverages react with polyvanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures that ultimately crystallize into bulk V2O5, with some evidence for residual monovanadate species. The rate per V atom increases with surface densities, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. The constant areal rate obtained after completion of a polyvanadate monolayer suggests that the surface reactivity of VOx species becomes independent of domain size once the predominant structures involve VOV bonds. The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density and containing predominately monovanadates shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane. The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants. Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene selectivity at all reactant conversion levels. The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial for processes like light alkane aromatization and the incorporation of methane into gasoline products. The nature of the cationic clusters, whether isolated cations or involving extraframework oxygen atoms, plays a key role in alkane activation. Oxidation of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide leads to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions, which are more reactive. The addition of steam stabilizes GaO+ ions, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5. Water promotes the formation of reactive hydrolyzed gallium species, decreasing the reaction energy for hydrogen recombination. The stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitates hydrogen desorption. Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The catalytic behavior of V-P-based catalysts is influenced by the method of preparation of the precursor, the P/V ratio, the presence of additives, and the methodology of activation and conditioning at high temperatures. The preparation method affects the morphology of the (VO)HP04.0.5H20 crystallites, the exposure of the (001) plane, and the extent of reduction of V5+. The P/V ratio in the precursor stabilizes (VO)P207, and the morphology of the catalyst influences its oxidizability. Low-temperature treatment in an oxygen-containing atmosphere and the presence of certain additives can also affect the catalyst's performance. The conditioning of the catalyst can lead to a transformation of the surface from a situation where pyrophosphate groups predominate to one where orthophosphate groups predominate. A slight excess of phosphorus in the catalyst composition helps to avoid the oxidation of V4+. Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus exhibit a balance between reducibility and reoxidizability, which is necessary for high activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to selectively activate paraffins with high selectivity, which is crucial for processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity, demonstrating the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss the use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, particularly the oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics using dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, which proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the nature of catalytic activity of zeolites, the role of iron, the chemical composition of the zeolite matrix, and the specific features of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis.

The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is a strategy for the catalytic conversion of methane. The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions. The effect of transition metal ions, preparation, and treatment methods on catalysts has been studied. The activity of transition metal ions for methane aromatization follows the sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. WH2SO4/HZSM-5 is a good catalyst for methane aromatization at high temperatures, but the formation of coke was neglected. The addition of a second metal component has been studied to enhance activity or stability. The splitting of the CH bond in methane is likely due to the interaction between CH4 and the surface oxygen species. The direct transformation route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde has been explored. Methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites has been investigated.

The molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and catalytic properties are influenced by preparation method, support nature, promotors, and environmental conditions. Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on alumina surfaces depending on vanadium loadings, with isolated and polymerized VO4 units at lower coverages and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation is strongly exothermic, with maximum temperatures around 873 K or higher observed in catalytic beds with concentrated feeds. Studies focus on the nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperatures and high vanadium loadings, relating phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion to catalytic performance. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO, and in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals like Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the stability and reducibility of the metal species, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions like the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are essential for the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which are crucial for catalytic activity. The strength and density of these acid sites, as well as the presence of metal ions in various coordination environments, play a critical role in the selectivity and conversion of alkanes. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to catalyze reactions under mild conditions, reduce energy consumption, and increase product yields, making them economically viable for large-scale production processes. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 zeolites by sublimation results in the formation of strong Lewis acid sites and the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites, which can be stronger or weaker depending on the metal. The presence of these acid sites affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of reducing or oxidizing atmospheres, can also influence the nature of the active species and thus the catalytic performance. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to catalyze reactions such as the MTG process, the manufacture of olefins from methanol, and the aromatization of light alkanes, which are important in the petrochemical industry. The introduction of metals such as Ga, Fe, and Zn into HZSM-5 cavities by sublimation results in the formation of various active species, including binuclear Fe3+ ions, (GaO)+ ions, and Zn2+ cations, which can compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. These species contribute to the acidity of the catalysts, with the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted sites increasing in the sequence HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5. The strength of these Lewis sites also increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe. The presence of these active species and the resulting acidity are crucial for the efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins and aromatics, which are essential in the petrochemical industry.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. However, it does discuss the quantum chemical study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide, which is of great interest in industrial catalysis. The study found that the potential energy surface has large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered. The barriers on the reaction pathway are 45-80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia. Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination. The reduction of other barriers, such as for propane adsorption, appears to require the involvement of a support for the vanadium oxide catalyst.

The conversion of light alkanes to more useful products has received much attention, particularly the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol or higher hydrocarbons. Higher alkanes, such as C&/C, can be converted without co-reactants. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is central to processes like Oleflex, Cyclar, and MB-forming, which convert light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, using catalysts like ZSM-5. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics is not completely selective, with light alkenes also being formed. On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, with gallium-containing samples preferred due to zinc volatilization at reaction temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups. The study also indicates that the modification of the zeolite with Zn changes the mechanism of the exchange, leading to regioselectivity in the methyl groups of propane. The kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting an alternative mechanism of H/D exchange reaction for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play significant roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Vanadium is the preferred element in catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is crucial. The stability of the product, multifunctionality, the type of C-H bond activation, and the role of acidity and basicity also contribute to the efficiency of these processes. Multifunctionality can be used as a criterion in catalyst design and as a tool to explain the reaction mechanism, but it is not adequate alone. These factors are essential for the industrial significance of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.

The catalytic conversion of methane to desired chemical products or liquid fuel is a promising approach for the utilization of natural gas resources and a significant challenge for catalysis science. Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions. The incorporation of Mo or Zn in ZSM-5 plays a significant role in methane activation. The yield of benzene increases with increasing partial pressure of methane. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated Mo or Zn, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is enhanced by the addition of metal cations, leading to improved dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions. The reaction conditions, including temperature and the presence of a carbenium ion mechanism, contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane to benzene with high selectivity and stability. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert inexpensive raw materials like alkanes into more valuable products like olefins through selective oxidation, which is a promising solution to meet the ever-increasing worldwide demand for olefins.

The mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, are influenced by the composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. The study of ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak, and at high temperatures, dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The formation of Brnsted acid protons upon ethane dissociation in the zinc case contrasts with the formation of gallium dihydride species and the absence of Brnsted acid protons in the gallium case. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable products, such as ethylene, through dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, the presence of certain additives, the state and location of the active form of the metal, and the presence of other compounds in the feed.

The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) and the vanadium surface density. Vanadia exists as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2 on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface density increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or structure. These findings contribute to the understanding of how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation.

The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity. The main features of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. The apparent activation energies for propane conversions were 121+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), and 120+15 kJ mol-1 for ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium). Over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity increased slightly. The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain reaction remains speculative. However, it is known that adsorption of aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer processes and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. The different behavior compared with the protonic form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization mechanisms. Aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, may have arisen from secondary demethylation reactions of aromatic products.

The state of gallium and the pretreatments of gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts have significant effects on the aromatization activity. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, which is limited by the number of anionic framework sites. The reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts prepared from physical mixtures of Ga203 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as materials that have been substantially reoxidized. Reoxidation at 550C generates a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which is optimal for the production of aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ is stable under typical reaction conditions for ethane dehydrogenation but can be reduced by hydrogen. The role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking. The aromatics/methane selectivity ratio is a good indicator of these relative rates. The effects of various pretreatments on catalyst performance for ethane dehydrogenation have been tested. To achieve high yields of aromatics, small amounts of rhenium, platinum, or rhodium are often added to the catalysts. The reduction of Ga2O3 is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, but the most active and selective catalyst for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6 aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to various unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatics. Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. Ga and Zn species enhance the rate of H2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps, allowing dehydrogenation reactions to occur without the requirement for concurrent cracking. The addition of metal species to H-ZSM5 channels increases aromatic turnover rates and decreases cracking turnover rates. These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities. Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products. This results in higher yields of desired products and reduced formation of by-products such as methane and ethane. The selective removal of H-atoms by recombinative desorption also contributes to the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes, which is highly desired in industrial processes.

"The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite, revealing two distinct routes of ethane activation. The first route involves the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route involves carbenium activation. The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step."

The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and its role in the reaction pathway are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.

Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The vanadium loading on γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts strongly affects the catalytic behavior for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and ethane. The catalytic activity increases with the vanadium loading, but the selectivity to corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms. The selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane is lower than the selectivity to ethene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Fe-ZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The Si/Fe molar ratio, the form of Fe-ZSM-5 (sodium or hydrogen), and the temperature and contact time all play a role in the conversion of methane to methanol and carbon dioxide. The structure of Fe-ZSM-5, characterized by spherulitic aggregates and typical XRD patterns for ZSM-5, indicates the incorporation of Fe(III) into framework sites. The increase in iron content leads to higher methane conversion, while the sodium form of molecular sieves improves the selectivity of methane oxidation to oxygenates. The highest selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation is achieved with a catalyst containing the lowest iron content. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Methanol is produced at lower temperatures, but its concentration decreases at higher temperatures due to further oxidation to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide.
