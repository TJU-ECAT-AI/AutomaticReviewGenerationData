Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene is more reactive relative to propane than ethene is to ethane. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times larger than the ethene formation rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropoxide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-vanadates appear, along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom) are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a maximum value at intermediate surface densities. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions. The effects of oxide domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and support surfaces. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity. High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2002.3570"},

The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species.

In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion.

At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons.

The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1997.1673"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects.

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane.

The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance.

The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1).

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers.

{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5"},

The two catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity values.

The study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation on single-crystal V2O5(001) by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene. An efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction has to make a compromise between the ability to activate the CH bond and the ability to release propene.

The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which contain surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The structure and reactivity of these surface vanadia species are influenced by factors such as monolayer surface coverage, stability of the surface vanadia monolayer, oxidation state, molecular structures, acidity, and the specific oxide support phase. The stability of the surface vanadia monolayer on typical oxide supports ensures the long life of industrial oxidation catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species have been extensively studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are determined by the net pH of the aqueous thin film, which depends on the surface point of zero charge of the oxide support and the amount of the surface vanadia species. The hydration-dehydration processes of the supported vanadia catalysts are completely reversible. The reduction of surface vanadia species in reducing environments results in the formation of surface vanadia (4+) and vanadia (3+) species. The molecular structures of the reduced surface vanadia species can be determined using in situ EPR, UV-VIS DRS, and XANES/EXAFS measurements. The influence of hydrocarbon oxidation reaction environments on the oxidation states of the surface vanadia species in supported vanadia catalysts has been examined for several reactions using in situ Raman spectroscopy. The in situ Raman studies provide insights into the behavior of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including the predominant surface vanadia species, the extent of reduction, the specific oxide support, and the ratio of polymerized to isolated surface vanadia species. The stability of the V(5) silica supported vanadia species may be related to the presence of only isolated surface vanadia species in this catalyst. The influence of preparation methods on the molecular structure of the hydrated and dehydrated surface vanadia species has been examined, and the same thermodynamically stable surface metal oxide species are formed independent of the specific synthesis method. The influence of the specific structure or modification of the oxide support on the molecular structure of the dehydrated surface vanadia species has been investigated, and no effect of long range order of the oxide substrate on the local structure of the surface vanadia species was found. The oxide supports possess surface Lewis acid sites, while unsupported V205 crystalline powders possess both surface BrCnsted and surface Lewis acid sites. The formation of the surface vanadia species on the oxide supports is accompanied by a decrease in the number of surface Lewis acid sites and an increase in the number of surface Br0nsted acid sites. The exact location of the surface BrCnsted acid sites is unclear, and the acidic characteristics of the surface vanadia overlayer are influenced by the specific oxide support ligand. The reactivity properties of supported vanadia catalysts are related to the dehydrated surface vanadia species, and the reactivity properties will be compared with the structural properties of the dehydrated surface V(5+) species rather than the dehydrated, reduced surface vanadia V(4+) and V(3+) species. The terminal V=O bonds do not contain the critical oxygen that affects the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds increases with surface vanadia coverage, and more systematic studies are required to fully understand the role of bridging V-O-V bonds in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, and changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The general trend is inversely correlated with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site exhibit a TOF that is independent of surface vanadia coverage, while oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by modifying the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction-specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available. The unique physical and chemical characteristics of supported vanadia catalysts, compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, contribute to their industrial significance in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5"},

However, it does discuss the regioselective H/D exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite, which is a type of metal-exchanged zeolite. The study shows that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The regioselectivity of the exchange is attributed to two proposed mechanisms: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance with Markovnikov's rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups.

At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O.

The dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is the first step in the aromatization process in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The mechanism of the reaction starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps involved in the alkyl route are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step. The literature does not provide information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons. The study aimed to compute intermediates and transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite. Two distinct routes of ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations were found. The first route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond, while the second route starts with carbenium activation. The first step of ethane and propane aromatization in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerization. The reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The computed activation energies for the three steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion is unfavorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step.\"", "Doi": "10.1039/a909426a"},

this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene.\"", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects. Oxygen balances in the oxidation of but-1-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride show that, despite the presence of gas-phase O2, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is higher in the but-1-ene conversion than in the n-butane case, highlighting the difference in reactivity and interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13 with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3 and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exothermic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases.

High alkene yields at reasonable residence times require high values of k1 and low values of k2/k1 and k3/k1. The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions have been previously reported, with somewhat inconsistent results. The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigorous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed to the persistent controversies. A detailed kinetic analysis of ethane ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range of VOx surface densities was reported and contrasted with those obtained using propane as the reactant. This analysis was combined with detailed structural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate their local structure to the values of the rate constants. In addition, the reaction rates of ethane and propane molecules with different CH bond energies and different adsorption energies of the respective alkenes were contrasted.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2002.3570"},

The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species.

In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion.

At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations is attributed to their ability to enhance reaction rates and selectivities.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in Zn-exchanged zeolites, the location of metal cations in the zeolite channels and their substitution for protons play a crucial role in the catalytic activity towards alkane aromatization. The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: rupture of the ethane CH bond on the Zn-O pair, formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn, and formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1). The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to increase the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatization of small alkanes, which is essential for the commercial Cyclar process and other aromatization processes for light hydrocarbons.

The type of vanadium species, such as VO4 tetrahedra or VO6 octahedra, depends on the vanadium content, with tetrahedral V5+ species observed on catalysts with lower V loading and octahedral V5+ species predominant on catalysts with higher V loading. Catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, but higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions is achieved on catalysts with mainly tetrahedral V5+ species. The number and nature of acid sites, such as Lewis and Brnsted acid sites, also change with the vanadium loading. The type of vanadium species and the nature of acid sites contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting the selectivity and activity in alkane transformations.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.1997.1673"},

Important features affecting the performance include the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins peaks at intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. Surface reduction affects the selectivity to propylene formation: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O instead of O2 causes the development of a more reduced and more selective surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with alumina support, which are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. With different metal oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation energies, influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Additives modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The order of increasing selectivities to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation follows the order of increasing basicity and increasing MO bond energy. The basicity of the support greatly affects selectivity. The use of a basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity due to the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich propylene product before further combustion to COx. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. In general, catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2, reflecting an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species. The size of MoOx domains affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically with increasing dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide. These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by strengthening MoO bonds, resulting in slower rate-determining CH bond activation steps involving the local reduction of Mo centers. The stronger inhibition of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by basic dopants, accounting for the higher selectivity to propylene.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009"},
{"Quotes": "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C , Hydrocarbons u . These experimental results illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action. However, a deeper examination of the dy- namics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are in- terpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride:a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is suggested to be con- trolled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxi- dation proceeds further to carbon oxides. These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts (only crystalhe phase, the va- nadyl pyrophosphate) depend upon the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidiz- able catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystal- line V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase. In the PVO system, there are many synthesis variables that affect the solid-state chemistry leading to the active catalyst, and thus the performance char- acteristics and mechanism of catalysis. For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing de- grees of crystallinity and defect structure of the re- sulting active phase. The final P V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of nu- merous publication. However, recent advances in understanding the sol- id-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compo- sitions. This has resulted in better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction is a fas- cinating and complex system. This catalytic system performs a 14-electron oxidation involving the ab- straction of 8 hydrogen atoms and insertion of 3 oxygen atoms. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), with the more interesting P:V atomic ratio near 1.0. The vanadyl orthophosphate crystal structure consists of V06 and PO4 groups arranged in layers [VOP04],, held together by long V-0 bonds or by hydrogen bonds. The layered structure leads to a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or the formation of sol- vated inorganic intercalation compound. The constitutive layers of the y-VOP04 framework have a tenden@ to shift cooperatively along the Burger vector in order to progressively form the columns of edge-share octahedra and pyrophosphate groups of (VO)2P207. This trans- formation is easier than the movement along the crys- tallographic shear planes proposed to account for the reduction of p-VOP04. a-VOP04 reduces under less severe conditions compared to p-VOP04, but it can also transform to p-VOP04 at high temperatures, particularly in the hot-spot zones of fixed-bed reactors. The presence of p-VOP04 in used or inactive catalysts for butane oxidation accounts for a loss of catalytic per- formance, and its greater stability compared with that of the other forms of VOP04 limits its further trans- formation. The active catalyst must possess an optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation according to Zazhigalov et al. from studies of V/P-mica com- pounds with variable V(IV)/V(V) ratios. These com- pounds preserve the layer structure of the initial a- V5+OP04 compound. Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(1V) ion. The results of Contractor et al., Johnson et al., Pepera et al., and Trifirb et a1. agree with the identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation. Contractor et al. indicate that in the absence of gas-phase oxygen it is possible to eliminate highly active surface oxygen species that are not selective. Using a recirculating solids reactor, with separate hydrocarbon-catalyst and oxygen-catalyst stages, it is possible to increase the selectivity to maleic anhydride to near 80%. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity according to Wenig and S h r a d e r . Selectivity for maleic anhydride increases with catalyst phosphorus loading, whereas specific ac- tivity of both selective and nonselective oxidation de- creases on increase of phosphorus content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V range. Best catalytic performances are exhibited with a catalyst with a P:V ratio of 1.1. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation producta. When insufficient oxygen is channeled to the active site,intermediate products may desorb and react at other sites. When surface oxygen concentrations are high, the evidence supports a single-site mechanism for selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride; Le., once n-butane is activated, it remains bound to the surface in various forms until desorption as maleic anhydride occurs. The very different kinetic behaviors of the alkene and alkane reactants bring into question the different cat- alyst surface effects induced by the two reactants. Szakacs et al. studied the oxidation of but-l-ene and n-butane to maleic anhydride in a pulse micro- reactor in the presence of gaseous O2 on a VOP04 catalyst. Oxygen balances show that in both cases, in spite of the presence of gas-phase 02, the Vv phosphate acts as the oxygen source. However, in the but-l-ene conversion the amount of lattice oxygen incorporated in the products of reaction is much higher than in the n-butane case, pointing out the substantial difference in the reactivity and of the type of interaction of the two hydrocarbons.", "English": "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The change of valence state of vanadium depends on the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the reaction temperature, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the reaction temperature. A deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to a better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides. The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate. The first step is controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available. However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides. There is a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and the rate of formation of vanadium(V). The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend on the preparation procedures. At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation, the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition. The vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) system, for instance, is characterized by the facile formation and interconversion of various crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, leading to confusion about the nature of the active phase. The synthesis variables, such as the use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems, affect the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase. The final P:V ratio of the active phase, which has been the subject of numerous publications, also plays a crucial role. Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed for the study of reactions with well-characterized, reproducible compositions, leading to better analysis of the role of oxidation states, the P:V ratio, and defect structure on the reaction mechanism. The n-butane to maleic anhydride reaction, a complex system involving a 14-electron oxidation, is influenced by the nature of the active site, the importance of the P:V ratio, oxidation state, and structural characteristics of the vanadium phosphorus oxide system. The detection and formation of intermediates are also critical factors. The PVO system exhibits a rich intercalation chemistry, with the formation of layered solids consisting of alternating inorganic and organic layers or solvated inorganic intercalation compounds. The stability and reactivity of different PVO phases, such as a-VOP04 and p-VOP04, affect catalytic performance, with p-VOP04 being less stable and more prone to transformation at high temperatures, leading to a loss of catalytic performance. The optimal V4+/V5+ ratio for selectivity in n-butane oxidation is crucial, with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion showing optimal performance properties. The identification of vanadyl pyrophosphate as the active phase in n-butane oxidation has been supported by various studies. The P:V ratio is a key parameter in determining catalyst selectivity and activity, with selectivity for maleic anhydride increasing with higher phosphorus loading, while specific activity decreases. The vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane to olefins, which then react further to form partial oxidation products. The mechanism of selective conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride is supported by high surface oxygen concentrations, indicating a single-site mechanism. In the oxidation of C4 alkenes, an interesting effect is observed: increasing hydrocarbon concentration initially increases the formation of maleic anhydride to a maximum, followed by a decrease with a corresponding increase in butadiene formation. The different kinetic behaviors of alkene and alkane reactants suggest different catalyst surface effects.

Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity. The role of metal species and acid sites in enhancing light alkane conversion to aromatics is a subject of intense controversy. Metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The activation and cleavage of CH bonds of alkanes occur predominantly at the Brnsted acid sites. Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2). Desorption of hydrogen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon species, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomerization and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. The activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeolites. Zn has a promoting effect on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, increasing the reaction rates and lowering apparent activation energies. The CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species. The influence of Zn on alkane activation is rationalized by dissociative adsorption of alkanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites. The intermediate formation of an olefin during dehydrogenation on Zn cations or the involvement of Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the alkane, is possible. The formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on Zn-modified zeolites has been concluded from IR studies. For zeolites with a high Zn content, the formation of a Zn alkyl species occurs at small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores. Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn oxide sites leads to Znalkyl species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl species by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite provides a transfer of protium from the SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule. The mechanism rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. The activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane. The interaction of the Znalkyl species with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange reaction but also a dehydrogenation step, yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps. Synergetic action of Zn and Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenation. The enhancement of alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic molecules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. The effect of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites is shown to be the direct influence of Zn.", "Doi": "10.1002/cphc.200800569"},

The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane.

The investigation of carbonaceous deposits, the synergetic effect between the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed by various studies. Many processes related to methane conversion require the use of oxygen, leading to the deep oxidation of methane. Researchers have tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen to suppress the formation of undesirable products. Mo/HZSM-5 is generally accepted as a good catalyst for this process. The addition of Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu can enhance the activity or stability of the catalyst. The catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores has been extensively studied. The indirect processes for methane conversion rely upon the production of synthesis gas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Methane can be directly converted to desired products such as ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alternative route for direct conversion has been extensively studied since 1982. Methane can be activated over multi-component catalysts to form benzene and carbonaceous deposits. Methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over supported Pt catalysts via a two-step route. Methane aromatization to benzene has been achieved over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalysts. Methane can be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. These metal species facilitate the disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

These metal species act as 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms, improving the efficiency of alkane transformations and contributing to their industrial significance.

The computed activation energies for these steps are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to the high activation barrier for the first step (67.6 kcal mol-1).

activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive.

M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals.
