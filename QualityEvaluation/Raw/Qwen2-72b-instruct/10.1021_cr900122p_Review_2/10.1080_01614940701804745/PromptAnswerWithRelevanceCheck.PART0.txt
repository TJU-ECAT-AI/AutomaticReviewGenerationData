1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of gallium as a promoter in zeolite-catalyzed reactions of light alkanes to aromatics, highlighting its ability to enhance dehydrogenation function and reduce the production of fuel gas by cracking. The promotional effect of gallium is attributed to its influence on the nature of active sites and the introduction of new reaction pathways. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their application in processes such as the M-2 forming process, Cyclar process, and Aroforming process, which aim to convert light hydrocarbons to higher molecular weight liquid products, particularly benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), from petroleum feedstocks.

1.文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机制和效率的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了镓作为轻烷烃转化为芳烃的沸石催化反应中的促进剂的作用，强调了其增强脱氢功能和减少裂解产生燃料气体的能力。镓的促进作用归因于其对活性位点性质的影响以及新反应途径的引入。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们在M-2形成过程、Cyclar过程和Aroforming过程中的应用，这些过程旨在将轻烃转化为更高分子量的液体产品，特别是从石油原料中提取苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX）。
