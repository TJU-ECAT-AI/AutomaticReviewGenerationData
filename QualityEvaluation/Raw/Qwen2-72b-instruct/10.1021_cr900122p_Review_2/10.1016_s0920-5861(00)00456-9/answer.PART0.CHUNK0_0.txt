1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does mention that catalyst development has played a crucial role in the advances of methane conversion processes, and that there remains a need for catalysts that promote higher selectivity to the desired product and have a longer life. The literature also discusses the use of certain catalysts, such as FePO4 for the production of CH3OH and HCHO, and Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite for the conversion of methane to aromatics. The efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as pretreatment conditions, reaction temperature, and the presence of certain additives.
