          [1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
          [2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
          [3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
          [4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
          [5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
          [6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
          [7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
          [8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
          [9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
          [10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
          [11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
          [12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
          [13] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
          [14] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
          [15] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
          [16] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
          [17] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
          [18] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
          [19] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
          [20] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
          [21] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
          [22] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
          [23] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
          [24] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
          [25] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."
          [26] "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides."
          [27] "Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes."
          [28] "Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O."
          [29] "While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the CH bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol."

          Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy for their active sites involving isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities, with silica being the optimal support. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The process follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the terminal oxo species of VV surface species being the most reactive. DFT calculations support these findings, indicating that H-abstraction is the most favored CH bond activation step, leading to the formation of propene via subsequent H-abstraction on adjacent isolated VO species.
          Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have been the focus of extensive research due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, catalyze alkylation reactions, and directly aromatize methane. The transformations involve complex mechanisms, with metalalkyl species as key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics occurs through dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts. These zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyze H/D exchange reactions, and form metalalkyl intermediates. Zn-zeolites display similar reactivity patterns, including the coaromatization of methane and alkanes. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The mechanism for the conversion of methane into ethylene is still debated, involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates. Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites are noteworthy for their selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O, involving the functionalization of an aromatic CH bond.

          支撑的钒氧化物因其活性位点可能涉及孤立的VO物种而特别引人注目，这对于选择性激活具有烯丙基CH键的烯烃（如丙烯）至关重要。小簇和孤立位点在完全覆盖的氧化物表面上对于实现高选择性至关重要，二氧化硅是最佳的支撑体。氧化脱氢的最佳温度窗口很窄，大约在500°C，较低的温度有利于燃烧，而较高的温度（>550°C）则开始出现非选择性的气相反应。该过程遵循Marsvan Krevelen机制，VV表面物种的终端氧物种是最具反应性的O位点。DFT计算支持这些发现，表明H-抽象是最受青睐的CH键活化步骤，通过在相邻的孤立VO物种上进行后续H-抽象，形成丙烯。
          金属交换沸石（M-沸石）因其能够将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃而成为大量研究的焦点，它们还可以催化烷烃与甲烷的烷基化反应，以及直接芳构化甲烷。尽管所有这些转化仍然存在许多机理争议和详细研究，但金属烷基物种可能是关键中间体。这些M-沸石可以具有各种结构（通常用三个字母代码标识：MFI，MOR，ZSM-5...）和组成，可以包括从主族（Al，Ga）到过渡金属元素（Cu，Fe，Mn，Mo，Pt，W，Zn，...）的广泛金属M。大量的研究集中在Ga和Zn沸石上，因为它们的工业相关性和前所未有的反应性。烷烃转化为芳烃通过连续的脱氢、寡聚和环化步骤发生，Ga沸石作为多功能催化剂发挥作用。这些沸石可以激活H2和烷烃，催化H/D交换反应，并形成金属烷基中间体。Zn沸石显示出非常相似的反应模式，包括甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化。M交换沸石，特别是那些含有Mo或Zn的沸石，可以以高选择性（>90％）直接将甲烷转化为苯和H2。甲烷转化为乙烯的机制仍在争论中，涉及碳正离子、自由基或有机金属中间体。在氧化条件下，含有MoOx和WOx的金属交换沸石催化甲烷直接氧化为甲醇/甲醛和相关氧化过程。Fe沸石因其通过N2O选择性氧化苯为酚而值得注意，涉及芳烃CH键的功能化。
