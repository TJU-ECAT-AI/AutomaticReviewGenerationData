[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
[3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
[4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
[5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
[6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
[7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
[8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
[9] "Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5."
[10] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
[11] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species (in place of further reduction of vanadium into VIII(OH2)."
[12] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
[13] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
[14] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
[15] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
[16] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
[17] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
[18] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
[19] "More recent experimental and computational studies point toward dinuclear Ga species as active sites, for which all steps are favored."
[20] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
[21] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
[22] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
[23] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
[24] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."

1.Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species, in contrast to other systems based on MoOx or WOx. This is important for alkenes with allylic CH bonds, such as propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated. Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivities. The support is a critical component in the catalyst formulation, as it can stabilize isolated centers, small clusters, or larger V2O5 crystallites. Silica is considered the optimal support in terms of selectivity. The optimal temperature window for the process is narrow, around 500 C, with lower temperatures favoring combustion and higher temperatures (>550 C) leading to unselective gas phase reactions. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) on supported VOx follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane and reduction of metal oxo surface species, followed by reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water. The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites. The most favored CH bond activation step is H-abstraction, yielding a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species. The formation of propene in propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species. Metal-exchanged zeolites (M-zeolites) have attracted significant research interest due to their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. While the mechanisms are still debated, metalalkyl species are probably key intermediates. M-zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition-metal elements. Ga- and Zn-zeolites have been extensively studied due to their industrial relevance and reactivity. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics involves successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps. Ga-zeolites act as multifunctional catalysts, with the formation of alkenes from alkanes occurring at Ga sites, involving CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate. Dinuclear Ga species are suggested as active sites, with all steps favored. Zn-zeolites display a similar reactivity pattern, including H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, and formation of aromatics from alkanes. Alkane activation, including methane, occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates. M-exchange zeolites, particularly those containing Mo or Zn, catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The conversion of methane into ethylene, followed by acid-catalyzed conversion into benzene, is accepted, with several proposed mechanisms involving carbocations, radicals, or organometallic intermediates.

1. 支撑的钒氧化物特别值得注意，因为活性位点可能涉及孤立的VO物种，与基于MoOx或WOx的其他系统不同。这对于具有烯丙基CH键的烯烃，如丙烯和更高烯烃，尤为重要，它们更容易被激活。小簇和完全覆盖的氧化物表面上的孤立位点对于实现高选择性至关重要。支撑材料是催化剂配方中的重要组成部分，因为它可以稳定孤立中心、小簇或更大的V2O5晶体。就选择性而言，二氧化硅被认为是最佳支撑材料。该过程的最优温度窗口相当狭窄，大约在500°C，较低的温度有利于燃烧，而较高的温度（>550°C）会导致非选择性的气相反应开始变得有竞争力。支撑的VOx上的氧化脱氢（ODH）遵循典型的Marsvan Krevelen机制，即烷烃的氧化和金属氧表面物种的还原，随后是分子氧对活性位点的再氧化和水的解吸。VV表面物种的终端氧物种是最具反应性的O位点。最有利的CH键活化步骤是H-抽象，产生一个自由基中间体和一个还原的VIVOH物种。丙烷脱氢中丙烯的形成最有利的途径是通过在相邻的孤立VO物种上对丙基自由基进行后续H-抽象（而不是进一步还原钒成VIII(OH2)）。金属交换沸石（M-沸石）因其将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃的能力而吸引了大量研究。尽管所有这些转化仍然存在许多机理争议和详细研究，但金属烷基物种可能是关键中间体。这些M-沸石可以有各种结构（通常用三个字母代码标识：MFI、MOR、ZSM-5...）和组成，可以包含从主族（Al、Ga）到过渡金属元素（Cu、Fe、Mn、Mo、Pt、W、Zn、...）的广泛金属M。大量的研究集中在Ga和Zn沸石上，因为它们的工业相关性和前所未有的反应性，这些系统将在下文详细讨论。烷烃转化为芳烃通过连续的脱氢、寡聚和环化步骤进行。Ga沸石作为多功能催化剂，其中一个关键步骤，即烷烃转化为烯烃，发生在Ga位点，涉及CH键活化和Ga烷基中间体的形成。这些物种对应于高度路易斯酸性中心，可以容易地极化和活化烷烃的CH键以及H2，生成GaR（或GaH）和OH表面物种。最近的实验和计算研究表明，二核Ga物种是活性位点，所有步骤都受到青睐。Zn沸石显示出非常相似的反应模式：H2和烷烃活化，H/D交换，从烷烃形成芳烃，以及甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化。烷烃活化（包括甲烷）也通过CH键活化和金属烷基中间体的形成发生，这在不同的Zn沸石上已经通过实验观察到。M交换沸石，特别是那些含有Mo或Zn的沸石，也催化甲烷直接转化为苯和H2，具有高选择性（>90%）。虽然活性位点的结构和性质仍然存在争议，但普遍接受的是，甲烷首先转化为乙烯，然后通过酸催化转化为苯。已经为涉及乙烯形成的第一个步骤提出了几种机制，它们涉及（1）碳正离子，（2）自由基，或（3）有机金属中间体，更具体地说是烯丙基、烯丙基或碳化物。
