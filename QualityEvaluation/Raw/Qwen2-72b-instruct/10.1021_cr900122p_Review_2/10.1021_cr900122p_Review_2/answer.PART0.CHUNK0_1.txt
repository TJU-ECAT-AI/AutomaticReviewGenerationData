[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
[3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
[4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
[5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
[6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
[7] "ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water."
[8] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."
[9] "The most favored CH bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIVOH species."
[10] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."
[11] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
[12] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
[13] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
[14] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
[15] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
[16] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
[17] "More recent experimental and computational studies point toward dinuclear Ga species as active sites, for which all steps are favored."
[18] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
[19] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
[20] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
[21] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxides, for instance, have active sites that involve isolated VO species, which are crucial for the selective activation of alkenes with allylic CH bonds. The structure of the support, such as silica, plays a critical role in stabilizing isolated centers and small clusters, enhancing selectivity. The optimal temperature window for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, to prevent combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. The mechanism follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, involving the oxidation of the alkane and reduction of metal oxo surface species, followed by reoxidation by molecular oxygen. Metal-exchanged zeolites, including Ga- and Zn-zeolites, are capable of transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, with metalalkyl intermediates playing a key role. The structure and composition of these zeolites, including the type of metal, affect their reactivity and selectivity. Zeolites containing Mo or Zn can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to perform complex transformations with high efficiency and selectivity.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。例如，支撑的钒氧化物具有涉及孤立VO物种的活性位点，这对于选择性激活具有烯丙基CH键的烯烃至关重要。支撑材料的结构，如二氧化硅，在稳定孤立中心和小簇方面起着关键作用，从而增强选择性。氧化脱氢的最佳温度窗口很窄，大约在500 C，以防止在较低温度下发生燃烧，在较高温度下发生非选择性气相反应。该机制遵循Marsvan Krevelen机制，涉及烷烃的氧化和金属氧物种的还原，随后由分子氧重新氧化。金属交换沸石，包括镓和锌沸石，能够将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃，其中金属烷基中间体起着关键作用。这些沸石的结构和组成，包括金属的类型，影响其反应性和选择性。含有Mo或Zn的沸石可以高选择性地直接将甲烷转化为苯和H2。这些催化剂由于其能够以高效率和选择性执行复杂转化的能力，在工业上具有重要意义。
