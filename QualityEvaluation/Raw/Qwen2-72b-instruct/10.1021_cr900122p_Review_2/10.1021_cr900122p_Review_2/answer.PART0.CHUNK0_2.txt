[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
[3] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
[4] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
[5] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
[6] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
[7] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
[8] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
[9] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
[10] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
[11] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
[12] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
[13] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
[14] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
[15] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxides, for instance, have active sites that possibly involve isolated VO species, which are crucial for high selectivity. The support material, such as silica, plays a critical role in stabilizing these active centers and small clusters, affecting the catalyst's performance. The optimal temperature for oxidative dehydrogenation is narrow, around 500 C, with lower temperatures favoring combustion and higher temperatures leading to unselective gas phase reactions. Metal-exchanged zeolites, with their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, have been the focus of extensive research. These zeolites can have various structures and compositions, including a wide range of metals from main group to transition metals. Ga- and Zn-zeolites, due to their industrial relevance and reactivity, have been particularly studied. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics involves dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps. Ga-zeolites can activate H2 and alkanes, catalyzing H/D exchange reactions. The active sites in these zeolites are highly Lewis acidic centers that can polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes. Zn-zeolites exhibit similar reactivity patterns, including alkane activation via CH bond activation and the formation of metalalkyl intermediates. M-exchange zeolites, especially those containing Mo or Zn, can directly convert methane into benzene and H2 with high selectivity. The initial conversion of methane into ethylene, followed by acid-catalyzed conversion into benzene, is a common mechanism in these processes.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。例如，支撑的钒氧化物可能具有涉及孤立VO物种的活性位点，这对高选择性至关重要。支撑材料，如二氧化硅，在稳定这些活性中心和小簇方面起着关键作用，影响催化剂的性能。氧化脱氢的最优温度范围很窄，大约在500 C，较低的温度有利于燃烧，而较高的温度会导致非选择性气相反应。金属交换沸石，由于其将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃的能力，已经引起了大量的研究努力。这些沸石可以有各种结构和组成，包括从主族到过渡金属的广泛金属。由于其工业相关性和反应性，Ga和Zn沸石尤其受到研究。将烷烃转化为芳烃涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环化步骤。Ga沸石可以激活H2和烷烃，催化H/D交换反应。这些沸石中的活性位点是高度路易斯酸性中心，可以极化并激活烷烃的CH键。Zn沸石表现出类似的反应模式，包括通过CH键激活和金属烷基中间体的形成来激活烷烃。特别是含有Mo或Zn的M交换沸石可以直接将甲烷转化为苯和H2，具有高选择性。将甲烷首先转化为乙烯，然后通过酸催化转化为苯，是这些过程中常见的机制。
