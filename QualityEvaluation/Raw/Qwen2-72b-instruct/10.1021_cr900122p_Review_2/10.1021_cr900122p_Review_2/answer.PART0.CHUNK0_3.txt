[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
[3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
[4] "It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."
[5] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
[6] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
[7] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
[8] "They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane."
[9] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
[10] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."
[11] "A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail."
[12] "Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps."
[13] "While all these steps are not fully understood, Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
[14] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
[15] "These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the CH bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate GaR (or GaH) and OH surface species."
[16] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
[17] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
[18] "M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%)."
[19] "While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis."
[20] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxides, with isolated VO species as active sites, are crucial for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly for alkenes with allylic CH bonds. The support material, such as silica, plays a critical role in stabilizing isolated centers and small clusters, which are essential for high selectivity. The optimal temperature for this process is narrow, around 500°C, to avoid combustion at lower temperatures and unselective gas phase reactions at higher temperatures. Metal-exchanged zeolites, with a wide range of structures and compositions, including various metals from main group to transition metals, are capable of transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. Ga- and Zn-zeolites, due to their industrial relevance and reactivity, are particularly noteworthy. The conversion of alkanes into aromatics involves dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps, with Ga-zeolites acting as multifunctional catalysts for the formation of alkenes from alkanes. The formation of metalalkyl intermediates is a key step in these transformations. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to catalyze various reactions, including H/D exchange, alkylation of aromatics, coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and direct aromatization of methane, with high selectivity and efficiency.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构，如支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。支撑的钒氧化物，其活性位点可能是孤立的VO物种，对于选择性氧化脱氢烷烃至关重要，特别是对于具有烯丙基CH键的烯烃。支撑材料，如二氧化硅，在稳定孤立中心和小簇方面起着关键作用，这对于高选择性至关重要。该过程的最佳温度范围很窄，大约在500°C，以避免在较低温度下燃烧和在较高温度下发生非选择性气相反应。金属交换沸石，具有广泛的结构和组成，包括从主族到过渡金属的各种金属，能够将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃。由于其工业相关性和反应性，镓和锌沸石尤其值得注意。烷烃转化为芳烃涉及脱氢、寡聚化和环化步骤，其中镓沸石作为多功能催化剂，用于从烷烃形成烯烃。金属烷基中间体的形成是这些转化中的关键步骤。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够催化各种反应，包括H/D交换、芳烃的烷基化、甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化以及甲烷的直接芳构化，具有高选择性和效率。
