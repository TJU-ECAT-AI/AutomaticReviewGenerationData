[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[3] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."
[4] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[5] "The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios."
[6] "The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[7] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity."
[8] "The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface."
[9] "The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac- tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking."
[10] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[11] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[12] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[13] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe- Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi."
[14] "The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."
[15] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[16] "Modification of these properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the additive ions), the total activity increases."
[17] "The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."
[18] "The order of the increasing selectivities to propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy."
[19] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."
[20] "Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
[21] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[22] "In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used."
[23] "Propane ODH rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species."
[24] "The size of MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower ODH activity."
[25] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid are important features affecting the performance of supported metal oxide catalysts. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per vanadium atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, corresponding to the development of the monolayer structure. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends on alkane/O2 ratios. Both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation. The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity. The use of N2O to replace O2 causes the development of a more reduced, and more selective, surface. The extent of reduction of the surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide support. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been extensively investigated. Catalysts made of vanadium oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. The selectivity to propylene can be correlated with the work function values. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene. Additives modify acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, affecting catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation is the isolation of active sites. The isomorphous substitution of active metal species into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction. In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Catalysts based on supported molybdenum oxide are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates per molybdenum atom increase with increasing Mo surface density and reach a maximum value for samples with 4.5 Mo/nm2. The size of MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger Mo O bonds show lower oxidative dehydrogenation activity. The presence of alkali affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation turnover rates decrease monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。负载金属氧化物催化剂的性能受金属阳离子的聚集程度、酸碱特性、反应条件下金属阳离子的价态以及固体的集体电子性质等重要特征的影响。在丙烷氧化脱氢中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随V2O5负载量的增加而增加，而每钒原子的速率在VOx域的中间大小时达到最大，这在表面VOx物种的活性和它们对反应物的可及性之间提供了平衡。对相应烯烃的选择性在活性相负载的中间值时达到峰值，这对应于单层结构的形成。在稳态氧化脱氢过程中，钒的还原程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的化学计量还原。催化显著还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比率。孤立和聚合物种都是活性的，但在稳态烷烃氧化过程中，聚合表面VO4物种比孤立物种更广泛地还原。丙烯的形成选择性受表面还原的影响：表面还原程度越高，选择性越高。用N2O代替O2会导致更还原、更具选择性的表面的形成。表面V5+物种的还原程度也取决于特定的氧化物载体。大量研究已经探讨了载体在烷烃氧化脱氢中对钒氧化物反应性的影响。由负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物制成的催化剂比那些使用氧化铝载体的催化剂更具选择性，而后者比那些使用二氧化钛的催化剂更具选择性，这主要是因为平行丙烷燃烧的程度较低，特别是在低钒负载下。活性VOx域的还原和催化性质可以因二元分散结构的形成而显著影响。丙烯的选择性可以与功函数值相关联。相对惰性的二次表面金属氧化物添加剂能够弱吸附丙烷，使其处于前体状态，为丙烷活化为丙烯提供催化活性VOx位点。添加剂修改了负载的钒氧化物的酸碱和氧化还原性质，影响了氧化脱氢中的催化性能。添加碱金属和碱土金属掺杂剂降低了活性，增加了丙烷氧化脱氢中对丙烯的选择性。设计高效烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂的关键因素是活性位点的隔离。将活性金属物种，如钒，同形地替代到微孔和介孔材料中是设计这种反应的新催化剂的有吸引力的策略。在VCoAPO-18的情况下，酸性位点（与Co2+阳离子的存在有关）和氧化还原位点（与V5+/4+和Co3+/2+的存在有关）的存在似乎是实现高选择性到乙烯在乙烷氧化脱氢期间的重要因素。基于负载的钼氧化物的催化剂，无论使用何种载体，其活性都低于基于钒的催化剂。每钼原子的丙烷氧化脱氢速率随Mo表面密度的增加而增加，并在4.5 Mo/nm2的样品中达到最大值。MoOx域的大小也影响Mo O的强度；更强的Mo O键显示出较低的氧化脱氢活性。碱金属（Cs、K、Li）的存在影响MoOx域的结构，并影响其电子和催化性质。丙烷氧化脱氢的周转率随着掺杂剂/Mo原子比和碱金属氧化物的碱性的增加而单调下降。
