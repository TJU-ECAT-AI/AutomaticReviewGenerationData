How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."
[2] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed [26]."
[4] "The objective of the present work is, for that rea- son, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium load- ings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium."
[5] "The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination,reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading."
[6] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[7] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

1.The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions. Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed. The study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium is important. The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination, reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading. The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

1.表面钒氧化物的分子结构和催化性能受制备方法、支撑物性质、促进剂和环境条件的影响。根据钒的负载量，不同的V5+钒氧化物物种在煅烧后在氧化铝表面形成。在单层以下的覆盖度下，主要观察到孤立和聚合的VO4单元，而在更高的钒负载量下，催化剂表面主要为VO6八面体。丙烷的氧化脱氢是一个强烈的放热反应，在使用更浓缩的进料时，在催化床中观察到约873 K或更高的最大温度。因此，研究在873 K的高温下，在4.5至13.2 wt.%钒的相对高钒负载下，在氧化铝支撑上形成的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性是重要的。将表征结果与丙烷氧化脱氢的催化性能进行比较，以获取有关在高钒负载下形成的钒物种的相组成、配位、还原性和分散性之间关系的信息。对于具有最高分散度的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种的样品，获得了最高的丙烯选择性。建议孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的。AlVO4相和类固态V2O5只有很低的催化活性。

1.The nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperature and high vanadium loading have a significant impact on the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading are closely related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only low catalytic activity. These findings contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxides in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
