[1] "The objective of the present work is, for that rea- son, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium load- ings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium."
[2] "The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination,reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading."
[3] "The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."
[4] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."
[6] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

1.The nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperature and high vanadium loading have been studied. The phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion of vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading have been characterized and compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity. The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

1.在高温和高钒负载下，研究了形成在氧化铝支撑上的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性。在高钒负载下形成的钒物种的相组成、配位、还原性和分散性已被表征，并与丙烷氧化脱氢的催化性能进行了比较。以AlVO4形式存在的钒的份额随钒负载量的增加而增加。孤立和聚合的四方配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的。AlVO4相和类固态V2O5只有很低的催化活性。对于孤立和聚合的四方配位V5+物种分散度最高的样品，获得了最高的丙烯选择性。
