The study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium is important.

1.表面钒氧化物的分子结构和催化性能受制备方法、支撑物性质、促进剂和环境条件的影响。根据钒的负载量，不同的V5+钒氧化物物种在煅烧后在氧化铝表面形成。在单层以下的覆盖度下，主要观察到孤立和聚合的VO4单元，而在更高的钒负载量下，催化剂表面主要为VO6八面体。丙烷的氧化脱氢是一个强烈的放热反应，在使用更浓缩的进料时，在催化床中观察到约873 K或更高的最大温度。因此，研究在873 K的高温下，在4.5至13.2 wt.%钒的相对高钒负载下，在氧化铝支撑上形成的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性是重要的。将表征结果与丙烷氧化脱氢的催化性能进行比较，以获取有关在高钒负载下形成的钒物种的相组成、配位、还原性和分散性之间关系的信息。对于具有最高分散度的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种的样品，获得了最高的丙烯选择性。建议孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的。AlVO4相和类固态V2O5只有很低的催化活性。
