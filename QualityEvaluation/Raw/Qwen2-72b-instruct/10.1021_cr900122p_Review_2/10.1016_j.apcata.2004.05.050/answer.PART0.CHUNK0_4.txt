[1] "The objective of the present work is, for that rea- son, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium load- ings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium."
[2] "The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination,reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading."
[3] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[4] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

1.The nature and properties of vanadium oxide species on alumina, especially at high vanadium loadings and calcination temperatures, significantly influence the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with a high dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity.

1.在高钒负载和煅烧温度下，氧化铝上钒氧化物的性质和特性对丙烷氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有重大影响。具有高分散度的孤立和聚合的四方配位V5+物种可以获得最高的丙烯选择性。孤立和聚合的四方配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的，而AlVO4相和类体V2O5的催化活性很低。
