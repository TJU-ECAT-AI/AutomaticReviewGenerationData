[1] "The objective of the present work is, for that rea- son, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium load- ings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium."
[2] "The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination,reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading."
[3] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[4] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

1.The nature and properties of vanadium oxide species formed on alumina support at high temperature and high vanadium loading have a significant impact on the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The phase composition, coordination, reducibility, and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading are closely related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only low catalytic activity. These findings contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxides in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

1.在高温和高钒负载条件下，形成在氧化铝载体上的钒氧化物物种的性质和特性对丙烷氧化脱氢反应的催化性能有重大影响。在高钒负载下形成的钒物种的相组成、配位、还原性和分散性与催化活性和选择性密切相关。具有最高分散度的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种可获得最高的丙烯选择性。孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都是活性的，而AlVO4相和类体V2O5只有低催化活性。这些发现对工业上支持钒氧化物在烷烃转化中的重要性，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中，具有重要意义。
