1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-containing MFI zeolites in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts in propane conversion and the lower selectivity toward aromatics, due to the enhanced ethane and methane formation, can be explained by these findings.

1.文献没有提供具体信息，说明金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。但是，它确实讨论了锌含量MFI沸石在丙烷活化中的作用。研究发现，Zn含量沸石上丙烷转化的初始步骤是Zn氧化物位点的解离吸附，导致丙基锌物种和ZnOH基团的形成。随后，丙基基团的脱氢和氢在Zn位点的重组导致丙烯和二氢的形成，以及活性催化位点的再生。丙烯在邻近的酸性位点进一步发生寡聚，而二氢在某些反应条件下可能参与丙烷氢解。这些发现可以解释Zn/H-MFI催化剂在丙烷转化中的较高活性和对芳烃的较低选择性，这是由于增强的乙烷和甲烷形成。
