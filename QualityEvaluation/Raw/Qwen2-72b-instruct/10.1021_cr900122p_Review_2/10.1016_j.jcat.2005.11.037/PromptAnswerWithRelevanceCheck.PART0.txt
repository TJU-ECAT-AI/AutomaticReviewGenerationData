How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

1.The literature does not provide specific information on how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation. The study found that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The subsequent dehydrogenation of propyl groups and recombination of hydrogen over Zn sites leads to propylene and dihydrogen formation and regeneration of an active catalytic site. Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The recombinative hydrogen desorption shifts the reaction equilibrium toward propylene formation, which further undergoes oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatisation, accounting for the higher aromatization activity of Zn-containing zeolites with respect to pure acidic sites.

1.文献没有提供具体信息，说明金属基催化剂（包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。但是，它确实讨论了锌改性的H-MFI催化剂在丙烷活化中的作用。研究发现，Zn含沸石上丙烷转化的初始步骤是Zn氧化物位点上的解离吸附，导致丙基锌物种和ZnOH基团的形成。随后，丙基基团的脱氢和Zn位点上的氢重组导致丙烯和二氢的形成，以及活性催化位点的再生。丙烯在邻近的酸性位点进一步发生聚合，而二氢在某些反应条件下可能参与丙烷的氢解。重组氢的解吸使反应平衡向丙烯的形成转移，丙烯进一步发生聚合、环化和芳构化，这解释了Zn含沸石相对于纯酸性位点的更高芳构化活性。

Propylene undergoes further oligomerization over the neighbouring acidic site, whereas dihydrogen may participate in propane hydrogenolysis under certain reaction conditions. The higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts in propane conversion and the lower selectivity toward aromatics, due to the enhanced ethane and methane formation, can be explained by these findings.

However, it does discuss the role of zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts in propane activation through dissociative adsorption, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. The efficiency of this process is influenced by the partial pressure of reactants, with hydrogen evolution favored at low pressures and hydrogenolysis preferred at high pressures. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert light alkanes to aromatics, which are important petrochemical feedstocks.
