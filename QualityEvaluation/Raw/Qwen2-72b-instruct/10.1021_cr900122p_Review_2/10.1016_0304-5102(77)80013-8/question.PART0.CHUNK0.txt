Yu. I. YERMAKOV Institute of Catalysis, Novosibirsk (LS_S.R.) (Received December 17, 1976) Summary On the basis of the IR-study of polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica it has been concluded that when treating these catalysts with hydrogen, surface zirconium hydrides are formed. These hydride compounds are direct precursors of the propaga- tion centres for ethylene polymerization.
Introduction It is known [ 1, 2] that upon interaction of organometallic zirconium compounds with oxide carriers, highly-active catalysts for ethylene polymer- ization are formed_ As is shown in ref. 1, Zr(C3Hs)4 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups following the scheme ( Si-OH),, + Zr(C3H-) - (- Si-O-),,Zr(C3Hsh_,,+ C3H s (1) where n = 1 - 3. The value of n (stoichiometry of interaction) depends on the zirconium content, the carrier nature and the temperature of its predehydra- tion [3].In the works by Bailard [1, 4] for the formation of propagation centres of polymerization,the scheme was proposed according to which the forma- tion of propagation centres in such catalysts in ethylene insert into the bond between zirconium and an organic ligand. However", as was shown in refs. 3 and 5, catalysts whose surfaces are cleaned after rehaoval of organic ligands by heating or treatment with hydrogen, maintain high activity in ethylene polymerization.
By using a mass-spectrometric method for catalysts obtained by the interaction of Zr(C3Hs)4 with silica and treated with hydrogen, sur- face zirconium hydrides were found [6]. Prelimina_my data were also obtain- ed on the interaction of zirconium hydrides with ethylene and their participation in ethylene polymerization.
The present paper describes the results of a study of the surface composi- 422 tion of supported organozconium catalysts. These results, obtained mainly by IR-spectroscopy,confirm the data on the formation of zirconium hy- drides in these catalysts and their role as drect precursors of the propa- gation centres of ethylene polymerization.
Experimental Registration of IR-spectra Aerosil previously pressed into 8 - 25 mg[cm  plates was dehydrated under vacuum at 450 C and residual pressure of 10 _4 - 10 -5 Tort for one hour. Adsorption of Zr(C3Hs)4 took place from a pentane solu- tion at 0 C. Tetraallylzrconium was synthesized according to the procedure in ref. 7. The excess of Zr(C3Hs) 4 after adsorption was removed by washing with pentane. The use of a special cuvette without seal and a breakable glass wall technique enabled us to carry out the experiment under conditions precluding admission of oxygen or water vapor. The species were then exposed to vacuum at room temperature up to the residual pressure of 10 4 _ 10 5 Torr. In the paper the species obtained under these conditions will be referred to as "'initial" species. The conditions for subsequent treat- ment of the catalyst with hydrogen, as well as the conditions for adsorption of water, dienes and ethylene will be described when considering the exper- imental results_ IR-spectra were registered on a UR-20 spectrometer in the range I 300 - 4 000 cm i at room temperature.
Mass-spectrometric analysis Quantitative analysis for the presence of hydrogen isotopes in the products of deuterolysis of the hydrogen-treated catalyst was performed utilizing a MX-1302 instrument.
A sample of the catalyst under vacuum was treated with water at 50 C, the mole ratio being D20]Zr  100_ Upon decomposition of the catalyst volatile products other than water vapour were frozen out at 77 K, so that the mixture for analysis contained hydrogen isotopes solely diluted with nitrogen. Samples for measuring the catalyst activity and for a mass-spectrometric analysis of its composition were taken from the same batch of the catalyst.
Data on the catalyst activity used for comparison with the results of the mass-spectrometric analysis were obtained at ethylene polymerization in hexane at 80 C and a constant pressure of 6 arm.

In the range 2 800 - 3 000 cm-  the spectrum of the "initial'" catalyst always contains the absorption bands of methylene and methyl C=H bonds whose intensities increase when heating the samples (Fig. l(a)). It may be assumed that the absorption in the range 2 800 - 3 000 cm-z and 1 400 - 1 500 cm- 1 is related not only to absorption by allyl ligands, but also to the presence in the catalyst of adsorbed organic compounds which are the products of partial decomposition of allyl zirconium complexes. 424 IR spectra of the catalysts treated with hydrogen Figure l(a) (curve 21 represents, the II-spectrum of the catalyst treated with hydrogen at 120 C. A sharp decrease in the absorption at 1 535 cm l and practically complete elimination of the band at 3 085 cm  are observed, which points to elimination of allyl ligands from the catalyst. It should be noted that elimination of the allyl ligands occurs when treating the "'initial" catalyst with hydrogen even at 25 C.
Hydrogen treatment of the "initial" catalyst also results in the occur- rence of new absorption bands at 1 625 cm 1 in the ranges 2100 - 2 300 cm z (Fig. l(a), curve 2) and 1300 - 1 500 cm 1 (the band without a distinct maximum); this points to the presence of adsorbed organic products.
Results of isotopic exchange When studying the hydrogen-treated catalysts, experiments were carried out concerned with the isotopic exchange using deuterium (the content of the isotope D being about 907). The IR-spectra of the samples treated with H2 and D2 are compared in Fig. l(a) (cuJes 2 - 5).
Keeping hydrogen-treated samples in an atmosphere of D2 (curve 3, Fig. l(a)) results in a sharp (3.5 - 4 fold) decrease in the intensity of the band at 1 625 cm i. The absorption intensity in the region 2100 - 2 300 cm i decreases to a much less extent; it is largely related to the fact that along with a decrease in the intensity of the bands at 2 190 and 2 260 cm- x an increase in the absorption at 2 225 cm- t is observed. The absorp- tion in the region 1 300 - 1 500 cm -  also diminishes_ Vhen the "'initial" sample was treated with Dz (see curve 4, Fig. l(a)),bands at 1 580 and 1 625 cm -x appeared in the spectrum. Treatment of this catalyst with H2 (curve 5, Fig. l(a)) results in about a two-fold increase in the intensity of the bands at 1 625 cm- 1 • whiie the intensity of the band at 1 580 cm- z diminishes slightly. In the region 1 300 - 1 500 cm
, as a result of the treatment with Hz, an increase in absorbance was observed. Thus, the exchange of H2 for D2 results in a change of the intensity of the bands at 1580 and1625 cm-1 in the 2100 - 2 300 cm 1 and the1300-1500cm 1 regions.
Water adsorption The adsorption of DzO on hydrogen-treated samples (Fig. 2, curve 3) in a quantity less than stoichiometric (0.5 mole D20/mole Zr) results in a decrease of the intensity of the 1 625 enl"" x bands and in the range 2100 - 2 300 cm- 1. Vhen using D20 in a quantity exceeding the stoichiometric in respect of the zirconium content (Fig_ 2, curve 4), practically complete disappearance of the bands at 2190 cm "-I is observed. As a result of the treatment with D20, three new bands (Fig. 2, curve 3) appeared in the spectrum; these bands are determined by oscillations in the SiOD-bonds (2 730, 2 770 cm -z) and ZrOD bonds (2 790 cm- 11 [9]. The corresponding bands at the H20 adsorption are observed in the range 3 680, 3 740, and 3 780 cm- x 425 i rt . !Ai i \ t7 5 \\ #1 !!

At the same time, with the adsorption of dienes the 1 535 and 3 085 cm 1 bands appear, characterizing formation of the allyl ligands. The 1 650 cm- 1 band,which seems to be related to double bonds, also manifests itself.Vith the adsorption of butadiene intensive absorption is obseed in the range 2 800 - 3 000 cm i (Fig. 3, curve 4) which is apparently related to polybutadiene formation. The adsorption of allene under similar conditions is characterized by less intensive bands in the range 2 800 - 3 000 cn .Ethylene adsorption The adsorption of ethylene on the "initial" catalyst does not change the intensity of the bands characteristic of the allyl groups (l 535 and 3 085 cm i), and the formation of a polymer is not observed in the spectrum under the follong experimental conditions: temperature 25 C, treatment with ethylene 15 rain, ethylene pressure 50 Torr, sample density below 5 mg/cm 2 and time of spectrum recording no more that 2 - 3 rain.
Note that on long-term recording of the spectrum a decrease is observed in the intensity of the absorption bands at 1 535 and 3 085 cm
, resulting from local heating of the sample and inevitable thermal decomposition of allyl complexes in the spectrometer beam, which is evidenced by sample darkening in the process of its illumination. A decrease in the intensity of the absorption bands at 1 535 and 3 085 cm 1 is of the same nature both in the presence and in the absence of ethylene, and is determined by the sample density and the time of Spectrum recording. For comparison with Fig. l(a) data are given for the effect of thermal vacuum treatment on the absorption intensity of allyl groups.
The adsorption of ethylene on a hydrogen-treated catalyst (Fig. 4,curve 4) results in the almost complete disappearance of the 1 625 cm-1. band, some decrease in the intensities of the 2 490 and 2 260 cm- ' bands and the simultaneous formation of a polymer, being characterized by strong absorption due to vibrations in the C-H bonds of the methylene and methyl groups in the range 2 800 - 3 000 cm- I. An increase in the quantity of ethylene adsorbed (curve 5) does not result in any changes in the 2 100 - 2 300 cm -1 range but gives a rise in absorption at 2 800 - 3 000 cm - .Provided that after the ethylene adsorption the catalyst is treated with water, then in the spectrum complete disappearance of the 2 190 cm -1 band is found; at the same time no additional changes of the 2 260 cm-  band occur (Fig. 4, curve 6).The adsorption of propylene and -butene on hydrogen-treated species results in the same changes in the IR-spectr a as for the adsorption of ethylene.

The quantity of zirconium hydrides in the catalyst sharply increases when the catalyst is treated with hydrogen (Table 1, Runs 2, 4). The number of the Zr-H bonds in the catalyst decreases by nearly one half after treatment with ethylene under the polymcrization conditions (the absorption of ethylene is mole C2H4 400 (see Table 1)). mole Zr An adequate correlation between the content of the hydrides in the catalyst and its catalytic activity is found for the hydrogen-treated catalyst samples differing in zirconium content, structural features of the carrier,etc. The correlation is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Discussion (i) On the surface composition of the "'initial'" catalyst Data on the investigation of the interaction of tetraallylzirconium with silica obtained by using the IR-spectroscopy technique were first published by 429 Ballard [1]. It was shown that with adsorption of Zr(C3Hs)4 the spectrum lost a band of isolated hydroxyl groups at 3 740 cm  and maintained a wide absorption band with a maximum at 3 680 cm . This points to the chemical inertness of these silica groups in respect of the protolysis of the allyl ligands of zirconium. In the spectrum of the "'initial" catalyst, absorp- tion bands appear at 1 535 and 3 085 cm , characterizing the availability of the allyl ligands [8]. Analogous results on the nature of the interaction of tetraallylzirconium with silica have been obtained in the present work (Fig. l(a)). In addition, in the IR-spectra of the "'initial" samples, absorption in the range 2 800 - 3 000 and 1 400 - 1 500 am-  has been noted (Fig. l(a),curve 2); the intensity of these absorption bands increases with heating of the catalyst, and it seems to be caused by the presence of adsorbed organic compounds formed as a result of decomposition of the allyl zirconium complexes.In Ballard's study [1] and in the present investigation, by contrast with the results given in ref. 15, no absorption was observed in the IR-spectra of the initial catalyst at 1 643 cm- i. These differences seem to be related to the catalyst sample preparation process. While for the present study the adsorp- tion of Zr(C3H)4 on silica was performed from a pentane solution, Candlin and Thomas [15] used a toluene solution. (ii) On the composition of surface zirconium compounds in hydrogen- treated catalysts Data obtained by a mass-spectrometric analysis (Table 1) show that in hydrogen-treated samples surface zirconium hydrides are formed. Zirconium hydrides of various compositions have been investigated using an IR-spectro- scopy technique [11, 12]. The zirconium hydride compounds identified in these studies are assumed to contain bridge hydride ions_ As a rule, valent vibrations of the bridge hydrides for various transition metals including zirconium are observed in the interval 1 000 - 1 700 cm -1 [10 - 12], e.g.,1 520 and 1 300 cm -1 for (-CsHs)aZrH [10], 1 390 cm -1 for (-CsHs)2Zr(H)C1 [11] _ On the other hand, valent vibrations of the end hydride metal-hydrogen bond are usually observed in the 1 700 - 2 300 cm - range [12].According to the above data, in our case the band at 1 625 cm-  may be related to valent vibrations of the Zr-H-Zr bond in a bridge hydride, and the bands in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm  to valent vibrations of the end Zr-H bonds which might be present in isolated hydride zirconium compounds. Now, on the basis of this assumption, let us consider the results of the isotopic exchange and the data on the interaction of a catalyst with water and dienes.The data obtained on variations in the absorption intensity at 1 625 cm a and in the 2100 - 2 300 cm -a range (Fig. l(a), curves 2 - 5) show that the surface compounds characterized by these bands are capable of an isotopic exchange reaction, i.e., they contain hydrogen. In this case, the substitution of a deuterium atom for a hydrogen atom should be accompan- 430 ied by the appearance of a band in the 1 160 - 1 190 cm 1 range instead of the 1625 cm 1 band, and the absorptio.n should be observed not in the 2 190 - 2 260 cm- i range but in the region of 1 560 - 1 630 cm- 1 It should be noted, however, that absorption at 1 160 - 1 190 cm- 1 occurs in the region of skeletal vibrations of aerosil, so it cannot be observed. As for the bands in the 2 190 - 2 260 cm I region, to judge by slight changes in their intensity in the deutero-hydrogen exchange, weak absorption in the 1 560 - I 690 cm  range should be expected as a result of the treatment with D2.The presence of the 1 580 cm-  absorption band in the spectra of the deuterium-treated catalyst supports the assumption made on the hydride nature of the bands in the range 2100 - 2 300 cm- 1. Absorption variations in the 1 300 - 1 500 cm  range at a deutero,hydrogen exchange show that, in this region, variations in hydrogencontaining groups also manifest them- selves. Partially, it might be the C-H deformational vibrations of organic products. Clarification of the nature of the variations found in this region needs more detailed study. The results obtained on incompIete isotopic exchange of the 1 625 cm  bands and those in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm  may be ascribed to several reasons. First, the deuterium used contain- ed about 10% of a light isotope of hydrogen. Second, as the results obtained show, isotopic exchange is observed for the adsorbed organic compounds being characterized by absorption in the 2 800 - 3 000 and 1 400 - 1 600 cm-  ranges (compare curves 2, 3 and 4, 5, Fig. l(a)). Third, isotopic exchange with carrier hydroxyl groups may also be possible. According to the latter, two reasons for the dilution of the initial deuterium with hydrogen may be expected which will result in an incomplete isotopic exchange.Exchange of hydrogen by deuterium in adsorbed organic compounds in the 2 800 - 3 000 cm- 1 region should result in the occurrence of new bands in the 2 050 - 2 200 cm 1 range; this will markedly hinder interpretation of the bands in the 2 100,2 300 cm  region which appear when treating the catalyst with hydrogen.Thus, the data obtained on isotopic exchange, taking into consideration the above limitations, allow us to assume that absorption at 1 625 cm- 1 and in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm- i is determined by the formation of zirconium hychide compounds.Additional data on the nature of bands at 1 625 cm-  and in the range 2100 - 2 300 cm- 1 were obtained when studying the adsorption of water and dienes. A decrease in the intensity of absorption at 1 625 cm I and in the 2 100 - 2 300 cm  range with water adsorption proceeds simultaneously with the formation of new bands associated with the hydroxyl groups ZrOD and.ZrOH (absorption at 2 790 and 3 780 cm - , respectively (Fig. 2)). This may be explained by the course of protolysis of zirconium hydride bonds following eqn. (2). It should be noted that for the band at 2 190 cm - ,almost complete disappearance of absorption is observed with excess of
D20. At the same time, the band with a maximum at 2 260 cm-1 after the
excess water adsorption decreases slightly (Fig. 2, curve 4). Similarly, for the 431 2 260 cm i band the deutero-hydrogen exchange is weak (Fig. l(a)}. All these data enable us to assume that the absorption in the region 2 260 cm l is determined largely by the presence of the groups containing no hydride bonds. As a result of the additional study of the problem it was discovered that the absorption in this region was determined by bond vibrations of the products of interaction between the surface zirconium ions and molecular nitrogen available as impurities in hydrogen. The presence of N2 in hydrogen u.sed for the catalyst treatment was confirmed by using a mass-spectrometric analysis with absorption of nitrogen. In special experiments at 100 - 400 C,a sharp increase in absorption in the 2 260 cmx range was observed. Thus,the absorption at 2 260 cm i is determined by zirconium nitride complexes formed on interaction of a hydrogen-treated catalyst with nitrogen.Changes observed in the IR-spectra of hydrogen-treated catalysts with adsorption of allene and butadiene (a decrease in the band intensity at 1 625 cm I and in the region 2 100 - 2 300 cm - x and emergence of the bands characteristic of the allyl ligands (Fig. 3)) may be explained by alkylla- tion of zirconium hydrides followed by the formation of allyl and crotyl complexes according to reactions (3) and (4)

(4) It should be noted that in all the reactions studied (deutero-hydrogen exchange, adsorption of water and dienes) the groups with 1 625 cm- absorption bands are the most reactive; less notable changes in these reaction processes occur in the region 2 100 - 2 300 cm 1 ; the weakest changes take place in the region 2 200 - 2 300 cm It should be emphasized that the 2 100 - 2 300 cm - 1 absorption range is most complicated in its nature and the available data are insufficient for a more detailed interpretation of the bands in this region.
(iii) Role of zirconium hydrides in the formation of actiue centres Data obtained by utilizing an IR-spectroscopy technique to study the interaction of ethylene with the "'initial" catalyst show that ethylene hardly interacts with surface zirconium complexes under conditions where there is no noticeable thermal decomposition of fixed allyl zirconium complexes (see "'Ethylene adsorption" above).
A decrease in the absorption band intensity at 1 535 cm- 1 found by Candlin and Thomas [15] after treatment with ethylene at 45 C for 90 rain seems to be related to the thermal decomposition of surface zirconium complexes proceeding readily under these conditions (see Fig. l(a)). At the 432 same time, when investigating the catalyst treated with hydrogen and containing zirconium hydrides (absorption at 1 625 cm and in the region 2 1 0 0 - 2 300 cm ), ethylene interaction with these surface compounds immediately followed by the formation of a polymer is observed (Fig. 4).
Similar results are also observed for the interaction of zirconium hydrides with butadiene (Fig. 3). An increased reactivity of bridge hydrides (1 625 cm i) in their interaction with ethylene and dienes shouId be emphasized as compared with end hydrides (2 100 - 2 300 cm ) which, under the exper- imental conditions, react incompletely.
Thus, the zirconium hydride compounds may be considered to be direct precursors of the propagation centers. Initiation of polymerization (formation of the propagation centers) may consist in alkylation of the hydride bond by olefin with the formation of an active zirconium-alkyl o-bond_ The resuits obtained using an IR-spectrometric technique when studying the interaction of the catalyst with ethylene, are in agreement with mass-spectrometric data, according to which the content of the hydride bonds decreases upon their interaction with ethylene (Table 1). In this case,the number of zirconium-hydride bonds being alkylated by ethylene should correspond to that of propagation centers. Actually, the number of Zr-H bonds alkylated by ethylene is close to tb at of the active centers determined for the given catalyst samples using the method of stopping polymerization by radioactive quenching agents. Therefore, the chain growth rate constants determined utilizing a radiochemical method [ 13] and calculated according to the number of Zr-H bonds alkylated by ethylene are close in value and equal to 1.8 X 10 2 1/mole s and 0.8 X 10 - 1/mole s, respectively. Taking into account these Kp values, and the maximum rate of polymerization determin- ed for the catalyst given and being equal to g of poIymer 4 000 (Run 1, Fig. 5),g Zr h arm the maximum number of propagation centers can be calculated to reach 30 - 60% of the total metal content in the catalyst. Good agreement observed between the number of Zr-H bonds in catalysts determined mass- spectrometrically,and the catalytic acti-ity (Fig. 5), is a reasonable factor in providing evidence in favour of the participation of zirconium hydrides in the formation of propagation centers.
For catalysts having high activity and thus a high extent of zirconium ion use, the zirconium oxidation number at the active center can be evaluat- ed_ In this case, one should proceed from the following results. First, as was shown earlier [4], at the active center the zirconium ions are bound with not less than two oxygen atoms. Second, the catalysts having the maximum activity before their interaction with ethylene contain up to two Zr-H bonds per zirconium ion (e.g., run 4, Table 1 ). From this it may be concluded that an active component of the catalyst mostly contains Zr(IV) compounds of the composition 433 -0

at the same time, the possibility for simultaneous participation of three- relent zirconium hydrides in the formation of active centers is not excluded [14]. However, the content of Zr 3+ in the catalyst according to the estima- tion by ESR [13, 14] usually does not exceed 3% of the total metal content that gives a small part of the maximum number of the propagation centers.
Another important analogy should be noted between the results obtained when studying the interaction of ethylene with a catalyst using ESR methods [14] and using IR spectroscopy. On the basis of the above considerations, the results obtained by IR spectroscopy mainly refer to Zr 4+ compounds, while ESR data provide information on the interaction of ethylene with Zr 3+ ions. However, in both cases, experimental results show that ethylene does not interact with the initial organo-zirconium complexes containing allyl ligands. Interaction is observed only for the complexes treated with hydrogen and containing no allyl ligands.
The results obtained in the present and earlier work [3, 5, 6, 13, 14] enable us to propose the following scheme for the propagation center formation in supported organo-zirconium catalysts for ethylene polymeriza- tion.
(1) The formation of an active component on interaction of tetraallyl zirconium with the surface hydroxyl groups. In this case, on the basis of the influence of this interaction stoichiometry on the catalyst activity [3] in active component VI and VII, the zirconium ion is bound with not less than two oxygen ions of the carrier. \ Si-OH " -- -?

(2) Elimination of allyl ligands from the active component, with the formation of zirconium hydride complexes as intermediate products required for the subsequent formation of the active centers. It may proceed either by thermal decomposition of the initial complex or as a result of its treatment with hydrogen. The conversion of the initial organo-zirconium compound may be assumed to proceed in different directions, and the yield of useful hydride formed depends on the catalyst content and the conditions of the initial complex decomposition. For the "qnitial'" catalyst treatment with hydrogen the following scheme for the formation of the zirconium hydrides 434 from the active component may be suggested based on chromatographic data showing a practically quantitative yield of propane.
