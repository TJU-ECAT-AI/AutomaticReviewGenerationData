Metal-based catalysts play a pivotal role in the transformation of alkanes, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. These catalysts, often comprising metals like vanadium, platinum, and palladium, facilitate the selective conversion of alkanes into more valuable hydrocarbons or oxygenates. The mechanisms typically involve the activation of the C-H bond, followed by dehydrogenation or oxidation steps. In oxidative dehydrogenation, the metal catalysts assist in the removal of hydrogen atoms, converting alkanes into alkenes, while oxygen acts as a co-reactant. Zeolite-catalyzed processes, on the other hand, leverage the porous structure of zeolites to enhance selectivity and efficiency, often in combination with metal sites for improved activity. Factors influencing the efficiency of these catalysts include the nature of the metal, its dispersion on the support, the presence of promoters, and the reaction conditions such as temperature and pressure. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and tailoring it to specific industrial applications, such as the production of olefins and aromatics from alkanes.
