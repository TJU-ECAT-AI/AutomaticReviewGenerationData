[3] "Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica zeolites,13,1621 the present results indicate that such species should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of the Al distribution.

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The structure-activity relationship is elucidated through spectroscopy, which helps to understand the role of the extraframework cations in catalytic reactions. In the case of gallium-containing high-silica zeolites, isolated mononuclear GaO+ ions are unstable and tend to oligomerize into multinuclear oxygenated gallium species, which have a more optimal coordination of the metal centers. Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species show significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of the reactive oxygenated extraframework species, which is supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in the dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机理和效率有重大影响,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。通过光谱学,结构-活性关系得以阐明,有助于理解额外框架阳离子在催化反应中的作用。在高硅含量的镓沸石中,孤立的单核GaO+离子不稳定,倾向于聚合成多核氧合镓物种,这些物种具有更优的金属中心配位。二核镓氧合阳离子物种对异裂CH键具有显著的反应性,促进了乙烷的催化脱氢。额外框架氧的碱性降低和二聚体中Ga3+的稳定四面体配位促进了H2的解吸。然而,簇的氢化原则上开辟了一条通过水解吸导致其分解的途径,产生反应性较低的还原位点。将水添加到碳氢化合物进料中可以增加反应性氧合额外框架物种的稳态浓度,这一见解得到了催化实验的支持:在水共进料时,观察到Ga+/ZSM-5沸石的脱氢活性显著增加。
