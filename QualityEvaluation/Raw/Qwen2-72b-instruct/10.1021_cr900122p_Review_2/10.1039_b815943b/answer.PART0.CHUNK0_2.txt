1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of supported vanadium oxides, spectroscopy is used to elucidate the structure-activity relationship, which is crucial for understanding the catalytic behavior. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in the confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory to develop structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The results indicate that isolated mononuclear GaO+ species tend to oligomerize in the microporous space, forming multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with a more optimal coordination of the metal centers. This oligomerization is driven by the formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species, which have a more optimal coordination of the metal centers. Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed is predicted to increase the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, which is supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in the dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。对于支撑的钒氧化物,使用光谱学来阐明结构-活性关系,这对于理解催化行为至关重要。对于金属交换沸石,通过光谱学和理论之间的相互作用来研究受限空间中的反应性,以开发催化作用的结构-活性关系。结果表明,孤立的单核GaO+物种倾向于在微孔空间中聚集体,形成具有更优的金属中心配位的多核氧合镓物种。这种聚集体是由多核氧合镓物种的形成驱动的,这些物种具有更优的金属中心配位。二核镓氧阳离子物种对异裂CH裂解表现出显著的反应性,促进乙烷的催化脱氢。外框架氧的碱性降低和二聚体中Ga3+的稳定四面体配位促进了H2的解吸。然而,簇的氢化原则上开辟了一条通过水解吸导致其分解的途径,导致反应性降低的还原位点。预测向碳氢化合物进料中添加水会增加反应性氧合外框架物种的稳态浓度。催化实验很好地支持了这一提议:在水共进料时,观察到Ga+/ZSM-5沸石的脱氢活性显著增加。这些因素对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性有贡献,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。
