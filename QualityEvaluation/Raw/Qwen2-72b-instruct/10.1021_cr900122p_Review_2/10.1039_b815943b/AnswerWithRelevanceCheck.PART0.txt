          [1] "Supported vanadium oxide in heterogeneous catalysis:elucidating the structureactivity relationship with spectroscopy Ilke Muylaert and Pascal Van Der Voort,  Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009"
          [2] "Reactivity in the confined spaces of zeolites: the interplay between spectroscopy and theory to develop structure activity relationships for catalysis Mercedes Boronat, Patricia Concepcin, Avelino Corma, Mara Teresa Navarro, Michael Renz and Susana Valencia,  Phys.

          [3] "Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica zeolites,13,1621 the present results indicate that such species should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of the Al distribution. The driving force is the formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with a more optimal coordination of the metal centers."
          [4] "Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species show significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage. Catalytic dehydro- genation of ethane over the Ga2O2 proceeds via initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
          [5] "The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster in principle opens a pathway to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites."
          [6] "Such insight predicts that addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of the reactive oxygenated extraframework species."
          [7] "Catalytic experiments support well this proposal: a substantial increase in the dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite is observed upon water co-feeding."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Spectroscopy elucidates the structure-activity relationship, crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic performance. For metal-exchanged zeolites, the reactivity in confined spaces is studied through the interplay between spectroscopy and theory, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships for catalysis. The stability and reactivity of extraframework metal-containing cationic species in high-silica zeolites are governed by factors such as the coordination environment and the necessity to compensate for positive extraframework charges. The formation of multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with optimal coordination of metal centers is a driving force for oligomerization of isolated mononuclear GaO+ species in microporous space. Binuclear gallium-oxo cationic species exhibit significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane. The decreased basicity of extraframework oxygen and stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in dimeric species promote H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. The addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, as supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite upon water co-feeding. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机理和效率有重大影响,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中,而这些因素对它们的工业意义至关重要。通过光谱学,结构-活性关系得以阐明,这有助于理解在像沸石这样的受限空间中的催化行为。例如,在高硅莫来石中,环状Ga2O2 2+离子比孤立的GaO+离子更稳定,导致对异裂CH断裂的增强反应性。Ga2O2上的乙烷催化脱氢通过初始异裂解离进行,随后是烯烃解吸和氢重组。额外框架氧的碱性降低和Ga3+离子的稳定四面体配位促进了H2解吸。然而,簇的氢化原则上开辟了一条通过水解吸导致其分解的途径,导致活性降低的还原位点。预测向碳氢化合物进料中添加水会增加反应性氧化额外框架物种的稳态浓度。催化实验很好地支持了这一提议:在水共进料时,观察到Ga+/ZSM-5沸石的脱氢活性显著增加。
