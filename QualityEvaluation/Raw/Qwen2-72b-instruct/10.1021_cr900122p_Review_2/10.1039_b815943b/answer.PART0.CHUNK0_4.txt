1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The structure-activity relationship is elucidated through spectroscopy, which helps in understanding the catalytic behavior in confined spaces like zeolites. For instance, in high-silica mordenite, cyclic Ga2O2 2+ ions are more stable than isolated GaO+ ions, leading to enhanced reactivity towards heterolytic CH cleavage. The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O2 proceeds via initial heterolytic dissociation, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination. The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster can lead to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. Addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed is predicted to increase the steady-state concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species, which is supported by catalytic experiments showing a substantial increase in dehydrogenation activity upon water co-feeding.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机理和效率有重大影响,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中,而这些因素对它们的工业意义至关重要。通过光谱学,结构-活性关系得以阐明,这有助于理解在像沸石这样的受限空间中的催化行为。例如,在高硅莫来石中,环状Ga2O2 2+离子比孤立的GaO+离子更稳定,导致对异裂CH断裂的增强反应性。Ga2O2上的乙烷催化脱氢通过初始异裂解离进行,随后是烯烃解吸和氢重组。额外框架氧的碱性降低和Ga3+离子的稳定四面体配位促进了H2解吸。然而,簇的氢化原则上开辟了一条通过水解吸导致其分解的途径,导致活性降低的还原位点。预测向碳氢化合物进料中添加水会增加反应性氧化额外框架物种的稳态浓度。催化实验很好地支持了这一提议:在水共进料时,观察到Ga+/ZSM-5沸石的脱氢活性显著增加。
