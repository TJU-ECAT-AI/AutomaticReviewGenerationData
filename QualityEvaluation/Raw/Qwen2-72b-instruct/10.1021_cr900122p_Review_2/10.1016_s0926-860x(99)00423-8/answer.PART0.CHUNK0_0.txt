1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. A new catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. This catalyst shows enhanced catalytic activity in the methane partial oxidation reaction compared to classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds such as methanol or formaldehyde is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. The transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is attractive because methanol can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and formaldehyde is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, is proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. In previous studies, three different types of metal oxide species were found in catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and metal oxide crystallites. The relative amount of each species varied with the metal loading. Formaldehyde selectivity was found to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的催化剂，用于甲烷的部分氧化，是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比，这种催化剂在甲烷部分氧化反应中显示出增强的催化活性。将甲烷转化为有机化合物，如甲醇或甲醛，具有重大的科学和工业意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是有吸引力的，因为甲醇可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而甲醛是许多合成有机方法中的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。在以前的研究中，在催化剂中发现了三种不同类型的金属氧化物物种：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种和金属氧化物晶体。每种物种的相对量随金属负载量的变化而变化。甲醛的选择性被发现依赖于支撑相的金属氧化物的分散性和性质。
