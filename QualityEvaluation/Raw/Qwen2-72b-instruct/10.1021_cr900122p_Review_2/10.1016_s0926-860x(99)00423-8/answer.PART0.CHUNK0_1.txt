[1] "A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite."
[2] "The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts."
[3] "The conversion of methane into organic com- pounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance."
[4] "This is due to the large nat- ural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component."
[5] "Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key compo- nent in a number of synthetic organic methods."
[6] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its in- teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
[7] "The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples (Fig. 2) exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions [25], O2Si4+ and O2Mo6+, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybde- num(VI) species on the surface."
[8] "In accordance with the proposed oxidation state, XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi- cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde- num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV)."
[9] "The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis- tered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3."
[10] "The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample."
[11] "Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra."
[12] "This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
[13] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
[14] "TPR studies were also carried out and the pattern for the Mo(2.01) sample was compared in Fig. 4 with that of a sample of a classical impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, with a similar Mo content (2%) [14], and that of a sample of pure MoO3."
[15] "It can be observed that the considerable dispersion of the metal obtained using our method gives rise to a significant decrease in the reducibility in comparison with MoO3."
[16] "The unique products obtained in the partial ox- idation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (corresponding to Mo(1.36)) were formalde- hyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and H2O."
[17] "After reaction, new Mo elemental analysis was carried out and the same value (1.36%) was obtained, in accor- dance with a strong interaction between the surface oxo-species and the support."
[18] "It can be seen that the formaldehyde selectivity was greatly enhanced with the grafted catalyst while the values for methane conversion remained similar."
[19] "Consequently, formalde- hyde space time yield increases significantly from 1319 to 61.1 g of HCOH per kg of catalyst and hour."
[20] "Although this value is still too low for a possible in- dustrial application of the process, it is similar to the best results reported in the literature for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [3337]."
[21] "In a previous paper [13], it has been shown that the acid sites of the zeolite are the active cen- ters for methane activation."
[22] "Therefore, it seems clear that the active sites of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde belong to the supported molybdenum phase."
[23] "In accordance with the results of Lucas et al. [13,14], the supported metal oxide phase of the im- pregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: (i) tetrahedral monomeric species with two M=O (M=Mo, W) terminal bonds, which is the main species at low loading, (ii) octahedral polymeric species similar to polyoxotungstates or polyoxomolybdates, which are the main species at medium and high loading (7.1%); and (iii) MO3 crys- tallites (M=Mo, W) with terminal M=O sites."
[24] "The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
[25] "Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides,respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts [32,33,3638]."
[26] "Thus, the 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classi- cal impregnated catalysts (the samples that exhibited the best HCOH yields of those tested in [13,14] that possess mainly polymeric species lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde."
[27] "As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity values are low."
[28] "This parameter is im- proved significantly with the use of the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (with carbon oxides still being the majority products)."
[29] "As noted above, this catalyst possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds."
[30] "Therefore, this result strongly supports the hypothesis regarding the specificity of Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane."
[31] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
[32] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. A new methane partial oxidation catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite, enhancing the catalytic activity in the MPO reaction compared to classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts.
2.The conversion of methane into organic compounds is scientifically and industrially significant due to the large natural gas reserves, where methane is the principal component. Transforming methane into methanol or formaldehyde is attractive as methanol can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and formaldehyde is a key component in synthetic organic methods.
3.The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, is proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, indicating the presence of MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis confirms the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species.
4.XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3. The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample, indicating that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. This behavior is different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used, where aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected.
5.TPR studies show that the considerable dispersion of the metal obtained using the grafting method gives rise to a significant decrease in reducibility compared to MoO3. The unique products obtained in the partial oxidation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst were formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2), and H2O. Formaldehyde selectivity was greatly enhanced with the grafted catalyst, while methane conversion values remained similar. Formaldehyde space time yield increases significantly.
6.Although the formaldehyde space time yield is still too low for industrial application, it is similar to the best results reported in the literature for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts. The acid sites of the zeolite are the active centers for methane activation, and the active sites of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde belong to the supported molybdenum phase.
7.The supported metal oxide phase of the impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and MO3 crystallites. The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite.
8.Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts. The 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classical impregnated catalysts lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde, resulting in low formaldehyde selectivity values. The new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst significantly improves formaldehyde selectivity, possessing well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds.
9.The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面，制备了一种新的甲烷部分氧化催化剂，与经典的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比，该催化剂在MPO反应中的催化活性得到增强。
2.将甲烷转化为有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是很有吸引力的，因为前者可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是合成有机方法中的关键成分。
3.甲烷分子与沸石表面相互作用导致的CH键的弱化被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240 nm处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，表明表面存在MoO42molybdenum(VI)物种。XPS分析确认了高度分散的molybdenum(VI)物种的存在。
4.催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支持物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较。嫁接催化剂的光谱与纯沸石样品的光谱几乎相同，表明复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够获得高度分散的氧化物种。这种行为与使用水浸渍方法时发现的行为不同，在水浸渍方法中，通常检测到MoO3的聚集体。
5.TPR研究表明，使用嫁接方法获得的金属的显著分散导致与MoO3相比，还原性显著降低。在嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上，甲烷的部分氧化产生的唯一产物是甲醛、碳氧化物（CO和CO2）和H2O。使用嫁接催化剂，甲醛选择性大大提高，而甲烷转化值保持相似。甲醛时空产率显著增加。
6.尽管甲醛时空产率仍然太低，无法用于工业应用，但它与文献中报道的MoO3/SiO2催化剂的最佳结果相似。沸石的酸性位点是甲烷活化的活性中心，而部分氧化为甲醛的活性位点属于支持的钼相。
7.浸渍HZSM-5催化剂的支撑金属氧化物相由三种类型的物种组成：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种和MO3晶体。这些催化剂在MPO反应中的行为可以解释为这些类型物种的密度和活性以及HZSM-5沸石的残留酸位点的函数。
8.几位作者报道了M=O和MOM位点在MoO3和V2O5硅支撑催化剂上从甲烷生产HCOH和碳氧化物的特异性。1.3%Mo/HZSM-5和7.1%W/HZSM-5经典浸渍催化剂（在[13,14]中测试的那些样品中甲醛产量最好的样品）主要由聚合物种组成，导致甲烷和甲醛的碳氧化物产量相对较高。结果，甲醛选择性值较低。使用新的嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂，甲醛选择性显著提高，具有两个终端Mo=O键的分散良好的单体物种。
9.对于上述两种Mo/HZSM-5催化剂，即之前描述的浸渍催化剂[14]和这里报告的嫁接催化剂，CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖率（由于金属负载高）导致CO选择性较低，尽管必须考虑到甲醛的进一步氧化。
