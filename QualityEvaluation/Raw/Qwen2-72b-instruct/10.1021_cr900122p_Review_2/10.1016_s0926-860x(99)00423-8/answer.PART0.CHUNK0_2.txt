[1] "A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite."
[2] "This reaction was performed in an organic solvent under an inert atmosphere with the exclusion of water from the reaction."
[3] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."
[4] "The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts."
[5] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its in- teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
[6] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition."
[7] "From an industrial viewpoint, this method offers potential for the design of efficient cat- alysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems."
[8] "The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples (Fig. 2) exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions [25], O2Si4+ and O2Mo6+, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybde- num(VI) species on the surface."
[9] "In accordance with the proposed oxidation state, XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi- cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde- num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV)."
[10] "The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis- tered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3."
[11] "The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample."
[12] "Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra."
[13] "This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
[14] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
[15] "In accordance with the results of Lucas et al. [13,14], the supported metal oxide phase of the im- pregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: (i) tetrahedral monomeric species with two M=O (M=Mo, W) terminal bonds, which is the main species at low loading, (ii) octahedral polymeric species similar to polyoxotungstates or polyoxomolybdates, which are the main species at medium and high loading (7.1%); and (iii) MO3 crys- tallites (M=Mo, W) with terminal M=O sites."
[16] "The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
[17] "Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides,respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts [32,33,3638]."
[18] "Thus, the 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classi- cal impregnated catalysts (the samples that exhibited the best HCOH yields of those tested in [13,14] that possess mainly polymeric species lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde."
[19] "As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity values are low."
[20] "This parameter is im- proved significantly with the use of the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (with carbon oxides still being the majority products)."
[21] "As noted above, this catalyst possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds."
[22] "Therefore, this result strongly supports the hypothesis regarding the specificity of Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. This reaction was performed in an organic solvent under an inert atmosphere with the exclusion of water. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition. From an industrial viewpoint, this method offers potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3. The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample. Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra. This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The supported metal oxide phase of the impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: tetrahedral monomeric species with two M=O (M=Mo, W) terminal bonds, octahedral polymeric species similar to polyoxotungstates or polyoxomolybdates, and MO3 crystallites (M=Mo, W) with terminal M=O sites. The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite. Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides, respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts. The 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classical impregnated catalysts lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde. As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity values are low. This parameter is improved significantly with the use of the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (with carbon oxides still being the majority products). This catalyst possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds. This result strongly supports the hypothesis regarding the specificity of Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。该反应在有机溶剂中进行，在惰性气氛下，排除了水。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与经典的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所提高。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致甲烷分子的扭曲，从而导致CH键的弱化，这被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种快速的替代方法，用于获得具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统。从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和非均相系统特定属性的有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240nm处显示吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较。嫁接催化剂的光谱与纯沸石样品的光谱几乎相同。这些光谱中没有发现起始复合物的特征峰或MoO3的特征峰。这一事实表明，复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够获得高度分散的氧化物种，这种行为与使用水浸渍方法时发现的行为不同。在水浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。浸渍HZSM-5催化剂的支撑金属氧化物相由三种类型的物种组成：具有两个M=O (M=Mo, W)终端键的四面体单体物种，类似于多钨酸盐或多钼酸盐的八面体聚合物种，以及具有终端M=O位点的MO3晶体(M=Mo, W)。这些催化剂在MPO反应中的行为可以解释为这些类型的物种的密度和活性以及HZSM-5沸石的残留酸位点的函数。几位作者报告了M=O和MOM位点(M: Mo, V)在MoO3和V2O5硅支撑催化剂上从甲烷产生HCOH和二氧化碳的特异性。1.3%Mo/HZSM-5和7.1%W/HZSM-5经典浸渍催化剂(在[13,14]中测试的那些具有最佳HCOH产率的样品)主要具有聚合物种，导致从甲烷和甲醛产生相对大量的二氧化碳。因此，甲醛选择性值较低。使用新的嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂(二氧化碳仍然是主要产品)，该参数显著提高。如上所述，这种催化剂具有两个终端Mo=O键的均匀分散的单体物种。这一结果强烈支持了关于Mo=O位点在甲烷产生HCOH中的特异性的假设。
