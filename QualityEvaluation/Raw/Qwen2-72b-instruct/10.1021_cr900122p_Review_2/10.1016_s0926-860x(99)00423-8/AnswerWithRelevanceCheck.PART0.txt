          [1] "A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite."
          [2] "The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts."
          [3] "The conversion of methane into organic com- pounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance."
          [4] "This is due to the large nat- ural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component."
          [5] "Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key compo- nent in a number of synthetic organic methods."
          [6] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its in- teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
          [7] "It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts,the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octa- hedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."
          [8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis- persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
          [9] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."
          [10] "The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples (Fig. 2) exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions [25], O2Si4+ and O2Mo6+, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybde- num(VI) species on the surface."
          [11] "In accordance with the proposed oxidation state, XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi- cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde- num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV)."
          [12] "The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis- tered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3."
          [13] "The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample."
          [14] "Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra."
          [15] "This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
          [16] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
          [17] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
          [18] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."
          [19] "A new catalyst for the MPO reaction has been ob- tained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
          [20] "This reaction takes place between the reactive acid hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the basic acetylacetonate ligands."
          [21] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water,isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."
          [22] "On account of the specific activity of these iso- lated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re- spect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase. Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition, offering potential for the design of efficient catalysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis indicates the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species. The XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3, showing that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected. The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity. A new catalyst for the MPO reaction was obtained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting in isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI with a large dispersion. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42species greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散度和性质。将过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种有效的替代方法，可以得到具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统，从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和异相系统特定属性有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240纳米处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较，显示复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够得到高度分散的氧化物种。在水性浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。两个Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸性位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较低的CO选择性。一种新的MPO反应催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到HZSM-5沸石表面获得的，结果得到了氧化态VI的钼的孤立氧化物种，具有很大的分散度。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性大大提高了甲烷部分氧化反应中甲醛的产量。
