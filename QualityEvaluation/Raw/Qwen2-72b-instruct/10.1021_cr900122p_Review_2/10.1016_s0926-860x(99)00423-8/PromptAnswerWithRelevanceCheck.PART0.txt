1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. A new catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. This catalyst shows enhanced catalytic activity in the methane partial oxidation reaction compared to classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds such as methanol or formaldehyde is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. The transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is attractive because methanol can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and formaldehyde is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, is proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. In previous studies, three different types of metal oxide species were found in catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and metal oxide crystallites. The relative amount of each species varied with the metal loading. Formaldehyde selectivity was found to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the metal oxide supported phase.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的催化剂，用于甲烷的部分氧化，是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比，这种催化剂在甲烷部分氧化反应中显示出增强的催化活性。将甲烷转化为有机化合物，如甲醇或甲醛，具有重大的科学和工业意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是有吸引力的，因为甲醇可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而甲醛是许多合成有机方法中的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。在以前的研究中，在催化剂中发现了三种不同类型的金属氧化物物种：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种和金属氧化物晶体。每种物种的相对量随金属负载量的变化而变化。甲醛的选择性被发现依赖于支撑相的金属氧化物的分散性和性质。

[8] "In accordance with the proposed oxidation state, XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi- cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde- num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV)."
[9] "The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis- tered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3."

[12] "This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
[13] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
[14] "TPR studies were also carried out and the pattern for the Mo(2.01) sample was compared in Fig. 4 with that of a sample of a classical impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, with a similar Mo content (2%) [14], and that of a sample of pure MoO3."
[15] "It can be observed that the considerable dispersion of the metal obtained using our method gives rise to a significant decrease in the reducibility in comparison with MoO3."
[16] "The unique products obtained in the partial ox- idation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (corresponding to Mo(1.36)) were formalde- hyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and H2O."
[17] "After reaction, new Mo elemental analysis was carried out and the same value (1.36%) was obtained, in accor- dance with a strong interaction between the surface oxo-species and the support."
[18] "It can be seen that the formaldehyde selectivity was greatly enhanced with the grafted catalyst while the values for methane conversion remained similar."
[19] "Consequently, formalde- hyde space time yield increases significantly from 1319 to 61.1 g of HCOH per kg of catalyst and hour."
[20] "Although this value is still too low for a possible in- dustrial application of the process, it is similar to the best results reported in the literature for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [3337]."
[21] "In a previous paper [13], it has been shown that the acid sites of the zeolite are the active cen- ters for methane activation."
[22] "Therefore, it seems clear that the active sites of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde belong to the supported molybdenum phase."
[23] "In accordance with the results of Lucas et al. [13,14], the supported metal oxide phase of the im- pregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: (i) tetrahedral monomeric species with two M=O (M=Mo, W) terminal bonds, which is the main species at low loading, (ii) octahedral polymeric species similar to polyoxotungstates or polyoxomolybdates, which are the main species at medium and high loading (7.1%); and (iii) MO3 crys- tallites (M=Mo, W) with terminal M=O sites."
[24] "The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite."

[26] "Thus, the 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classi- cal impregnated catalysts (the samples that exhibited the best HCOH yields of those tested in [13,14] that possess mainly polymeric species lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde."
[27] "As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity values are low."
[28] "This parameter is im- proved significantly with the use of the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (with carbon oxides still being the majority products)."
[29] "As noted above, this catalyst possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds."
[30] "Therefore, this result strongly supports the hypothesis regarding the specificity of Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane."
[31] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
[32] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. A new methane partial oxidation catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite, enhancing the catalytic activity in the MPO reaction compared to classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts.
2.The conversion of methane into organic compounds is scientifically and industrially significant due to the large natural gas reserves, where methane is the principal component. Transforming methane into methanol or formaldehyde is attractive as methanol can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and formaldehyde is a key component in synthetic organic methods.
3.The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, is proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions, indicating the presence of MoO42molybdenum(VI) species on the surface. XPS analysis confirms the presence of highly dispersed molybdenum(VI) species.
4.XRD spectra of the catalysts were registered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2, and MoO3. The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample, indicating that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups allows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species. This behavior is different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used, where aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected.
5.TPR studies show that the considerable dispersion of the metal obtained using the grafting method gives rise to a significant decrease in reducibility compared to MoO3. The unique products obtained in the partial oxidation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst were formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2), and H2O. Formaldehyde selectivity was greatly enhanced with the grafted catalyst, while methane conversion values remained similar. Formaldehyde space time yield increases significantly.
6.Although the formaldehyde space time yield is still too low for industrial application, it is similar to the best results reported in the literature for MoO3/SiO2 catalysts. The acid sites of the zeolite are the active centers for methane activation, and the active sites of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde belong to the supported molybdenum phase.
7.The supported metal oxide phase of the impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three kinds of species: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and MO3 crystallites. The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite.
8.Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts. The 1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 classical impregnated catalysts lead to a relatively high production of carbon oxides from both methane and formaldehyde, resulting in low formaldehyde selectivity values. The new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst significantly improves formaldehyde selectivity, possessing well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds.
9.The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface. The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面，制备了一种新的甲烷部分氧化催化剂，与经典的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比，该催化剂在MPO反应中的催化活性得到增强。
2.将甲烷转化为有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是很有吸引力的，因为前者可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是合成有机方法中的关键成分。
3.甲烷分子与沸石表面相互作用导致的CH键的弱化被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240 nm处显示出吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，表明表面存在MoO42molybdenum(VI)物种。XPS分析确认了高度分散的molybdenum(VI)物种的存在。
4.催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支持物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较。嫁接催化剂的光谱与纯沸石样品的光谱几乎相同，表明复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够获得高度分散的氧化物种。这种行为与使用水浸渍方法时发现的行为不同，在水浸渍方法中，通常检测到MoO3的聚集体。
5.TPR研究表明，使用嫁接方法获得的金属的显著分散导致与MoO3相比，还原性显著降低。在嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上，甲烷的部分氧化产生的唯一产物是甲醛、碳氧化物（CO和CO2）和H2O。使用嫁接催化剂，甲醛选择性大大提高，而甲烷转化值保持相似。甲醛时空产率显著增加。
6.尽管甲醛时空产率仍然太低，无法用于工业应用，但它与文献中报道的MoO3/SiO2催化剂的最佳结果相似。沸石的酸性位点是甲烷活化的活性中心，而部分氧化为甲醛的活性位点属于支持的钼相。
7.浸渍HZSM-5催化剂的支撑金属氧化物相由三种类型的物种组成：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种和MO3晶体。这些催化剂在MPO反应中的行为可以解释为这些类型物种的密度和活性以及HZSM-5沸石的残留酸位点的函数。
8.几位作者报道了M=O和MOM位点在MoO3和V2O5硅支撑催化剂上从甲烷生产HCOH和碳氧化物的特异性。1.3%Mo/HZSM-5和7.1%W/HZSM-5经典浸渍催化剂（在[13,14]中测试的那些样品中甲醛产量最好的样品）主要由聚合物种组成，导致甲烷和甲醛的碳氧化物产量相对较高。结果，甲醛选择性值较低。使用新的嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂，甲醛选择性显著提高，具有两个终端Mo=O键的分散良好的单体物种。
9.对于上述两种Mo/HZSM-5催化剂，即之前描述的浸渍催化剂[14]和这里报告的嫁接催化剂，CO选择性的相对较高值可归因于沸石表面残留的酸位点。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖率（由于金属负载高）导致CO选择性较低，尽管必须考虑到甲醛的进一步氧化。

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。该反应在有机溶剂中进行，在惰性气氛下，排除了水。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与经典的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所提高。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致甲烷分子的扭曲，从而导致CH键的弱化，这被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。过渡金属配合物嫁接到反应性表面结构上是一种快速的替代方法，用于获得具有可定义结构和组成的催化系统。从工业角度来看，这种方法为设计具有均相和非均相系统特定属性的有利组合的高效催化剂提供了潜力。样品的紫外漫反射光谱在约240nm处显示吸收带，这是由于配体到金属电荷转移跃迁，与表面提出的MoO42钼(VI)物种的存在一致。XPS分析表明存在高度分散的钼(VI)物种。催化剂的XRD光谱被记录下来，并与纯支撑物、MoO2(acac)2和MoO3的光谱进行了比较。嫁接催化剂的光谱与纯沸石样品的光谱几乎相同。这些光谱中没有发现起始复合物的特征峰或MoO3的特征峰。这一事实表明，复合物与表面OH基团之间的反应使我们能够获得高度分散的氧化物种，这种行为与使用水浸渍方法时发现的行为不同。在水浸渍的情况下，通常会检测到MoO3的聚集体。浸渍HZSM-5催化剂的支撑金属氧化物相由三种类型的物种组成：具有两个M=O (M=Mo, W)终端键的四面体单体物种，类似于多钨酸盐或多钼酸盐的八面体聚合物种，以及具有终端M=O位点的MO3晶体(M=Mo, W)。这些催化剂在MPO反应中的行为可以解释为这些类型的物种的密度和活性以及HZSM-5沸石的残留酸位点的函数。几位作者报告了M=O和MOM位点(M: Mo, V)在MoO3和V2O5硅支撑催化剂上从甲烷产生HCOH和二氧化碳的特异性。1.3%Mo/HZSM-5和7.1%W/HZSM-5经典浸渍催化剂(在[13,14]中测试的那些具有最佳HCOH产率的样品)主要具有聚合物种，导致从甲烷和甲醛产生相对大量的二氧化碳。因此，甲醛选择性值较低。使用新的嫁接Mo/HZSM-5催化剂(二氧化碳仍然是主要产品)，该参数显著提高。如上所述，这种催化剂具有两个终端Mo=O键的均匀分散的单体物种。这一结果强烈支持了关于Mo=O位点在甲烷产生HCOH中的特异性的假设。

Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散性和性质。

[1] "A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite."
[2] "After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species."
[3] "The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts."
[4] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its in- teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
[5] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis- persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
[6] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition."
[7] "From an industrial viewpoint, this method offers potential for the design of efficient cat- alysts with an advantageous combination of specific properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems."
[8] "The UV diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples (Fig. 2) exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions [25], O2Si4+ and O2Mo6+, in accordance with the presence of the proposed MoO42molybde- num(VI) species on the surface."
[9] "In accordance with the proposed oxidation state, XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi- cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde- num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV)."
[10] "The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis- tered and compared to those of the pure support, MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3. The spectra of the grafted catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure zeolite sample."
[11] "Neither the characteristic peaks of the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found in these spectra. This fact indicates that the reaction between the complex and the surface OH groups al- lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and this behavior was different from that found when an aqueous impregnation method was used."
[12] "In the case of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are usually detected, as mentioned previously."
[13] "The relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im- pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface."
[14] "The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of formaldehyde must be taken into account [38]."
[15] "A new catalyst for the MPO reaction has been ob- tained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
[16] "This reaction takes place between the reactive acid hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the basic acetylacetonate ligands."
[17] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water,isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."
[18] "On account of the specific activity of these iso- lated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re- spect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
