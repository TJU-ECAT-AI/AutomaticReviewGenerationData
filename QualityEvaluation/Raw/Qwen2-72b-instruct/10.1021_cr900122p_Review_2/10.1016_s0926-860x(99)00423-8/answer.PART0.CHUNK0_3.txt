[1] "A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst was prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. After the grafting reaction, the solid was washed, dried, and calcined in air to afford the final [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts. The conversion of methane into organic compounds of greater interest is of significant scientific and industrial relevance due to the large natural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal component. Transformation of methane into methanol or formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the former compound can be converted into liquid fuels similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key component in a number of synthetic organic methods. The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism. Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率有重大影响。一种新的甲烷部分氧化(MPO)催化剂是通过将MoO2(acac)2嫁接到干燥的HZSM-5沸石表面制备的。嫁接反应后，固体被洗涤、干燥，并在空气中煅烧，以获得最终的[S]O2MoO2，Mo(VI)，高度分散的表面物种。这种新材料在MPO反应中的催化活性与传统的Mo,W/HZSM-5浸渍催化剂相比有所增强。将甲烷转化为更感兴趣的有机化合物在科学和工业上具有重要意义，这是由于大量的天然气储备，其中甲烷是主要成分。将甲烷转化为甲醇或甲醛是一个非常有吸引力的过程，因为前者化合物可以转化为类似于汽油的液体燃料，而后者是许多合成有机方法的关键成分。甲烷分子与沸石表面的相互作用导致的甲烷分子的扭曲，被提议为甲烷活化机制的第一步。甲醛的选择性取决于金属氧化物支撑相的分散性和性质。
