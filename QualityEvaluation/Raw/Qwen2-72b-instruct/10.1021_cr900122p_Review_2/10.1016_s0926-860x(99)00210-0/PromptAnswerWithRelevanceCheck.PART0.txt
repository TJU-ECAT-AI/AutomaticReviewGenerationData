1.The structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. Silica-alumina zeolites with a two-dimensional structure and pore size close to the dynamic diameter of benzene are excellent supports for Mo-based catalysts in methane dehydro-aromatization. HZSM-5 zeolite is one of the best supports for methane dehydro-aromatization, and Mo is the best transition metal ion component. The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite effect. Optimization of reaction conditions, including pre-treatment atmosphere, temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, has a significant impact on the catalytic performance.

1.The structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, the valence and location of Mo species, and the loading of transition metal ions (TMI) such as Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr significantly influence the catalytic performance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations. The preparation method, impregnation of metal components, calcination temperature, and reaction conditions such as pre-treatment atmosphere, temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration also have a significant impact on the efficiency of these processes. The presence of other light hydrocarbons in the methane feedstock can also affect the reaction. The industrial significance of these factors is that they can be optimized to enhance the reactivity and stability of the catalysts, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivity to desired products. For example, natural gas can be converted to higher hydrocarbons under lower temperatures over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, and methane can be highly activated at low temperatures in the presence of alkenes or higher alkanes over H-galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite.

HZSM-5沸石的结构和酸性、Mo物种的价态和位置以及Ru、Pt、W、Zr、Co、Fe和Cr等过渡金属离子（TMI）的负载量对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的催化性能有显著影响。制备方法、金属组分的浸渍、煅烧温度以及预处理气氛、温度、压力、甲烷空速和再生等反应条件也对这些过程的效率有重大影响。甲烷原料中其他轻烃的存在也会影响反应。这些因素的工业重要性在于，它们可以通过优化来增强催化剂的反应性和稳定性，从而提高转化率和对所需产品的选择性。例如，天然气可以在较低温度下通过Mo/HZSM-5催化剂转化为高碳烃，甲烷可以在较低温度下在H-镓铝硅酸盐ZSM-5型（MFI）沸石的存在下被高度活化，转化为高碳烃。

1.HZSM-5沸石的通道结构和酸性，以及Mo物种的价态和位置，是催化性能的关键因素。支撑的TMI主要位于外表面，只有少量扩散到沸石的通道中。Li的存在可以降低对苯的选择性，但可以增加对乙烯的选择性。具有二维结构和孔径接近苯动力学直径的硅铝沸石是Mo基催化剂用于甲烷脱氢芳构化的良好支撑。Ru、Pt、W、Zr、Co、Fe和Cr的负载可以增强催化剂的反应性和/或稳定性，而V、Li和P的添加则有相反的影响。制备方法、金属组分浸渍的后果以及煅烧温度等也会影响性能。不同的预处理和反应条件，如预处理气氛、温度、反应温度、压力、甲烷空速和再生，对催化性能有重大影响。Mo物种与HZSM-5之间的相互作用对于理解Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上的甲烷脱氢芳构化具有特殊意义。Mo物种的引入和/或第二金属组分的添加改变了沸石的酸性位点，减少了强酸位点的数量，增加了中等强度酸位点的数量。适当分散的Ru的存在促进了Mo物种的还原和CH键的裂解。Mo物种在反应中的真实状态以及Mo物种和HZSM-5沸石在Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上甲烷脱氢芳构化的基本反应途径中的作用，对甲烷化学和甲烷活化理论的发展具有普遍意义。
