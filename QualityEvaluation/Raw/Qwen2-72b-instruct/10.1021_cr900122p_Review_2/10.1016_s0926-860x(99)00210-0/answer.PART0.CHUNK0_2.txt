[1] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance [25]."
[2] "The authors correlated the catalytic performance to their structure of the zeolites and came to the conclusion that the silicaalumina zeolite with two- dimensional structure and a pore size near to the dynamic diameter of benzene are fine supports of Mo- based catalysts for methane dehydro-aromatization."
[3] "In summary, for methane dehydro-aromatization the HZSM-5 zeolite is one of the best supports, and the best TMI component is Mo."
[4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
[5] "Optimization of reaction conditions has also been extensively studied. All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction condi- tions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."

1.The structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. Silica-alumina zeolites with a two-dimensional structure and pore size close to the dynamic diameter of benzene are excellent supports for Mo-based catalysts in methane dehydro-aromatization. HZSM-5 zeolite is one of the best supports for methane dehydro-aromatization, and Mo is the best transition metal ion component. The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite effect. Optimization of reaction conditions, including pre-treatment atmosphere, temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, has a significant impact on the catalytic performance.

1. HZSM-5沸石的结构和酸性，以及Mo物种的价态和位置，是催化性能的关键因素。具有二维结构和孔径接近苯动态直径的硅铝沸石是甲烷脱氢芳构化中Mo基催化剂的优良载体。对于甲烷脱氢芳构化，HZSM-5沸石是最好的载体之一，Mo是最好的过渡金属离子成分。Ru，Pt，W，Zr，Co，Fe和Cr的负载可以增强催化剂的反应性和/或稳定性，而V，Li和P的添加则有相反的影响。预处理气氛，温度，反应温度，压力，甲烷空速和再生等反应条件的优化对催化性能有重大影响。
