1.HZSM-5沸石的通道结构和酸性，以及Mo物种的价态和位置，是催化性能的关键因素。支撑的TMI主要位于外表面，只有少量扩散到沸石的通道中。Li的存在可以降低对苯的选择性，但可以增加对乙烯的选择性。具有二维结构和孔径接近苯动力学直径的硅铝沸石是Mo基催化剂用于甲烷脱氢芳构化的良好支撑。Ru、Pt、W、Zr、Co、Fe和Cr的负载可以增强催化剂的反应性和/或稳定性，而V、Li和P的添加则有相反的影响。制备方法、金属组分浸渍的后果以及煅烧温度等也会影响性能。不同的预处理和反应条件，如预处理气氛、温度、反应温度、压力、甲烷空速和再生，对催化性能有重大影响。Mo物种与HZSM-5之间的相互作用对于理解Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上的甲烷脱氢芳构化具有特殊意义。Mo物种的引入和/或第二金属组分的添加改变了沸石的酸性位点，减少了强酸位点的数量，增加了中等强度酸位点的数量。适当分散的Ru的存在促进了Mo物种的还原和CH键的裂解。Mo物种在反应中的真实状态以及Mo物种和HZSM-5沸石在Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上甲烷脱氢芳构化的基本反应途径中的作用，对甲烷化学和甲烷活化理论的发展具有普遍意义。
