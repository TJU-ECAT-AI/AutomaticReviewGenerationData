[1] "The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance [25]."
[2] "The authors correlated the catalytic performance to their structure of the zeolites and came to the conclusion that the silicaalumina zeolite with two- dimensional structure and a pore size near to the dynamic diameter of benzene are fine supports of Mo- based catalysts for methane dehydro-aromatization."
[3] "In summary, for methane dehydro-aromatization the HZSM-5 zeolite is one of the best supports, and the best TMI component is Mo."
[4] "The loading of Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of V, Li, and P has the opposite influence."
[5] "In addition, the preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature, etc. can also affect the performance."
[6] "Optimization of reaction conditions has also been extensively studied."
[7] "All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."
[8] "In addition, some researchers have explored the influence of the presence of other light hydrocarbons in the methane feedstock."
[9] "Pierella et al. [44] observed that natural gas could be converted to higher hydrocarbons under lower temperatures (773873 K) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst."
[10] "Choudhary et al. [45] found that methane could be highly activated, yielding a high rate of conversion to higher hydrocarbons at low temperatures (673 873 K) by its reaction over H-galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite in the presence of alkenes or higher alkanes."

1.The structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, the valence and location of Mo species, and the loading of transition metal ions (TMI) such as Ru, Pt, W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr significantly influence the catalytic performance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations. The preparation method, impregnation of metal components, calcination temperature, and reaction conditions such as pre-treatment atmosphere, temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration also have a significant impact on the efficiency of these processes. The presence of other light hydrocarbons in the methane feedstock can also affect the reaction. The industrial significance of these factors is that they can be optimized to enhance the reactivity and stability of the catalysts, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivity to desired products. For example, natural gas can be converted to higher hydrocarbons under lower temperatures over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, and methane can be highly activated at low temperatures in the presence of alkenes or higher alkanes over H-galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite.

1. HZSM-5沸石的结构和酸性、Mo物种的价态和位置以及Ru、Pt、W、Zr、Co、Fe和Cr等过渡金属离子（TMI）的负载量对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的催化性能有显著影响。制备方法、金属组分的浸渍、煅烧温度以及预处理气氛、温度、压力、甲烷空速和再生等反应条件也对这些过程的效率有重大影响。甲烷原料中其他轻烃的存在也会影响反应。这些因素的工业重要性在于，它们可以通过优化来增强催化剂的反应性和稳定性，从而提高转化率和对所需产品的选择性。例如，天然气可以在较低温度下通过Mo/HZSM-5催化剂转化为高碳烃，甲烷可以在较低温度下在H-镓铝硅酸盐ZSM-5型（MFI）沸石的存在下被高度活化，转化为高碳烃。
