1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have a significant impact on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions are emphasized. The interactions between transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits, are discussed. The channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors for the catalytic performance. The loading of certain metals can enhance the reactivity and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of others has the opposite influence. The preparation method, the consequence of impregnation of the metal components, and the calcined temperature can also affect the performance. Various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions exert great influences on the catalytic performance. The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is significant for understanding the reaction. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component changes the acid sites of the zeolite. The mode of methane activation is a focus of debate, with various active sites and reaction mechanisms proposed. The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the reaction is a major obstacle for understanding and process development. The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite are significant for methane chemistry and the development of the theory of methane activation.
