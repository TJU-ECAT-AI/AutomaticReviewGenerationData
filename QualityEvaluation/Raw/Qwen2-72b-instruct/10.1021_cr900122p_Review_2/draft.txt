1. Metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations: Mechanisms, applications, and factors influencing efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes

Metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium oxides, play a pivotal role in alkane transformations, with efficiency peaking at intermediate loadings and VOx domain sizes \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Surface reduction, facilitated by N2O, enhances propylene selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. Additives, such as alkali dopants, modify the properties of these catalysts, impacting performance by reducing activity while increasing selectivity \[10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009\]. The redox properties of feedstock affect the catalyst's surface oxidation state, impacting product formation \[10.1021/cr00083a003\]. The valence state of vanadium, influenced by the feedstock's redox potential, oxidation, and reduction rates, is critical for selectivity in maleic anhydride synthesis \[10.1021/cr00083a003\]. Zn-modified zeolites catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics, with Zn enhancing H/D exchange and lowering activation energy \[10.1002/cphc.200800569\]. Zeolites' confined spaces foster the formation of multinuclear gallium species, enhancing ethane dehydrogenation \[10.1039/b815943b\]. Water co-feeding enhances dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/b815943b\]. Supported vanadia catalysts, with surface species on oxide supports, are key in hydrocarbon oxidation, including oxidative dehydrogenation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5\]. The efficiency of these catalysts hinges on the stability of surface vanadia monolayers, molecular structure influenced by pH, and reactivity dependent on V=O, V-O-V, and critical V-O-support bonds \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5\]. Metal-based catalysts, including vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, are vital in alkane transformations via oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions \[10.1016/j.molcata.2006.03.068\]. Efficiency is influenced by composition, structure, and conditions, with active sites, acidity, and pore structure playing a critical role \[10.1016/j.molcata.2006.03.068\]. Optimization and regeneration strategies combat deactivation, enhancing industrial significance \[10.1016/j.molcata.2006.03.068\].
