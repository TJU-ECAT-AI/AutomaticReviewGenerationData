[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."
[2] "The catalytic activation of CH bonds is of fundamental interest, because it is the crucial step in important technological processes and also in many enzymatic reactions."
[3] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."
[4] "The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol (or propene) formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites."
[5] "The apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."
[6] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a critical step in technological processes and enzymatic reactions. The first hydrogen abstraction in propane dehydrogenation occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. The apparent activation energy and rate constant for the first hydrogen abstraction are in close agreement with experiments. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如支撑的钒氧化物,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响,特别是在氧化脱氢等过程中,这是技术过程和许多酶促反应的关键步骤。丙烷脱氢中第一次氢原子抽提仅在OVV位点上发生,而第二次氢原子抽提也可以在VOSi桥氧位点上发生。在OVV位点上再吸附后丙烯的形成速率远大于在HOVIV位点上再吸附后异丙醇或丙烯的形成速率。第一次氢原子抽提的表观活化能和速率常数与实验结果非常接近。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂,当V表面覆盖率低于3 V/nm2时,观察到了丙烯形成的周转频率。
