[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."
[2] "The catalytic activation of CH bonds is of fundamental interest, because it is the crucial step in important technological processes and also in many enzymatic reactions."
[3] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."
[4] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."
[5] "The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol (or propene) formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites."
[6] "With regard to the type of active oxygen species in the reaction, we find that only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction."
[7] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

1.The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The initial step in these transformations is the activation of CH bonds, which is a crucial step in both technological processes and enzymatic reactions. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol or propene formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. Only vanadyl sites are involved in the rate-determining step, but the second hydrogen abstraction may occur also at VOSi bridging oxygen sites without changing the overall kinetics of the reaction. Vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.

1.金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,如支撑的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石,对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重大影响,特别是在丙烷氧化脱氢等过程中。CH键的催化活化是技术过程和许多酶促反应中的关键步骤。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢,使用被钒氧基取代的倍半硅氧烷来模拟支撑在二氧化硅上的单体钒氧化物物种。第一次氢原子抽离仅发生在OVV位点,而第二次氢原子抽离也可以发生在VOSi桥接氧位点。在OVV位点重吸附后,丙烯的形成速率远大于在HOVIV位点重吸附后异丙醇或丙烯的形成速率。只有钒氧基位点参与了决定速率的步骤,但第二次氢原子抽离也可以在VOSi桥接氧位点发生,而不改变整体反应动力学。如果钒酸盐位点是体相表面的一部分,而不是作为单体支撑在二氧化硅上,它们在丙烷氧化脱氢中可能具有显著更高的活性。

1.催化CH键的活化在重要的技术过程和酶促反应中至关重要，例如，由支持的过渡金属氧化物催化剂对较低烷烃的氧化脱氢以及由细胞色素P450对CH键的氧化到COH基团。研究集中于由支持的过渡金属氧化物催化剂对丙烷的氧化脱氢，特别是V2O5在SiO2上的支持，考虑了OV(O)3表面物种的单体。第一次氢原子的抽象仅发生在OVV位点上，而第二次氢原子的抽象也可以发生在VOSi桥接氧位点上。在OVV位点上读取后丙烯的形成速率远大于在HOVIV位点上读取后异丙醇或丙烯的形成速率。提出的机制与可获得的周转频率和活化能相容，而其他建议则不受计算的支持。如果钒酸盐位点是体表面的一部分，而不是作为单体在二氧化硅上支持，则它们在丙烷的ODH中可能显着更活跃。但是，由于在三维颗粒中仅有一部分位点可访问，因此V2O5晶体表面上的表面的表观周转频率可能较低。
