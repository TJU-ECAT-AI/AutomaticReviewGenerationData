Departamento de Ingenier a Qu mica, Facultad de Ciencias Qu micas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real 13004, Spain Received 29 June 1999; received in revised form 2 February 2000; accepted 2 February 2000 Abstract Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure. Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, poly- molybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized. Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In the last years, the direct conversion of methane into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical com- pounds has attracted great interest because of the considerable increase in the world natural gas reserves [13]. Among the different processes proposed, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts has been one of the most studied processes. However, in spite Corresponding author.

The most recent papers about the use of MoO3/SiO2 catalysts in the title reaction have been focused on the elucidation of the relationship between the structure of the supported metal oxide phase and their role in the reaction mechanism. Baares et al. have proposed that methane activation occurs through oxygen acti- vation on the reduced sites of the supported molybde- num oxide [4]. Parmaliana et al. showed the existence of a straight correlation between the density of the re- duced sites, evaluated in steady-state conditions by O2 chemisorption, and the reaction rate [5,6]. Moreover,it has been shown that catalyst reducibility depends 0926-860X/00/$  see front matter  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

on the interaction between the metal oxide phase and the support surface varying with several factors such as metal oxide loading and nature of the support [7,8].
Several active Mo sites have been described for silica-supported molybdena catalysts. It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation [6,911]. Thus, Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products.
Recently, we have reported the methane partial oxidation to formaldehyde over tungsten oxide based catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolite and SiO2 [12,13]. It was shown that both methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are closely related to the dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst. Thus, the relative high reducibility of the poorly dispersed tungsten oxide species (mainly poly- meric species) for loading higher than 4.0 wt.% lead to a significant increase in the methane conversion values obtained for the catalysts [13]. On the other hand, a relation between monomeric W species and the Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite was suggested [12].
In this paper, we compete to demonstrate the speci- ficity of the monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane. In the first place, we report the catalytic results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over conventional aqueous impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 cat- alysts. Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts contain- ing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions. Both catalyst series were charac- terized in order to understand the structure of the sup- ported molybdena phase.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
NaZSM-5 zeolite was prepared following a synthe- sis procedure described elsewhere [14]. The product was 100% crystalline (determined by X-ray diffrac- tion) with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 90. Fully ex- changed HZSM-5 (checked by chemical analysis) was obtained by ion exchange of 10 g of the zeolite with 200 ml of 0.6 M aqueous solution of HCl followed by drying at 110C for 14 h.
The Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by aque- ous impregnation, according to an earlier procedure [12]. The HZSM-5 zeolite powder was impregnated in a rotary evaporator with aqueous solutions of ammo- nium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24Â·4H2O (10 ml of solution/g zeolite). The concentration of the salt was adequately selected in order to yield molybde- num loading in the range 0.33.3 wt.%. After 4 h of stirring at ambient temperature, the water was com- pletely removed by evaporation at 70C under vac- uum. Next, the impregnated samples were calcined in air at 675C for 2.5 h. These catalysts will be named to as ZMo x where x indicates the weight percentage of molybdenum in the catalyst.
A different catalyst series was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite. The first step of preparation method was the aqueous impregnation with solutions of am- monium heptamolybdate (with the same conditions described above), obtaining uncalcined samples with Mo loading in the range 2.06.6 wt.%. These ma- terials were then further treated with an ammonia aqueous solution in order to remove the physically adsorbed molybdenum species of the catalysts. The dry sample (10 g) was stirred for 5 min with 200 ml of 1 M ammonia solution, then filtered and repeatedly washed with deionized water. Finally the samples were dried at 110C for 4 h and calcined at 675C for 2.5 h. These catalyst will be referred to as t-ZMo x (treated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts), x indicating the molybdenum loading of the samples.
2.2. Catalytic runs
Methane conversion tests were carried out at atmo- spheric pressure in a fixed bed installation previously described [12,13]. It basically consisted of a gas feed system for methane and oxygen (without diluent), a fixed bed quartz reactor (the dimensions of the reaction zone were internal diameter 21.4 mm and length 6 cm) and an exit gas flowmeter. The reactor was heated by means of an oven with three independently con- trolled heating zones. A thermocouple was placed in the center of the bed in order to measure the reaction

83 temperature (bed axial variation being only 5C). A HewlettPackard 5890A gas chromatograph was em- ployed for the analysis of the feed and reactor effluent streams. A Porapak Q column was used to separate CH4, CO2, CO+O2, HCOH and water and a molec- ular sieve 5A packed column to separate CO and O2.
Calibration for formaldehyde was obtained with a 40% HCOH aqueous solution.
In all the experiments, catalyst samples were pre- treated in situ in an oxygen flow from the ambient temperature to the reaction temperature, 600C, and held at the latter approximately 1 h. Space velocity of the feed was 7.41 g h mol1 and the CH4:O2 mo- lar ratio was 5.3:1. Approximately 2 h were required to reach apparently steady state conditions. Sampling of the product stream was repeated until the analyti- cal results were reproducible. The carbon balance was always better than 97% for all the runs.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Molybdenum analysis were carried out by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Varian SpectrAA- 220FS spectrometer. UV diffuse reflectance spectra (UV DRS) were performed by using Spectralon as a
