[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres- sure."
[2] "Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."
[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."
[4] "A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."
[5] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."
[6] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

1.The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as Mo/HZSM-5, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Two series of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The first series was prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate, resulting in two molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. The second series was prepared by aqueous impregnation followed by washing with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species. The two catalyst series showed different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to low formaldehyde selectivity, while treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

1.金属基催化剂的组成和结构，如Mo/HZSM-5，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。测试了两系列Mo/HZSM-5催化剂在甲烷部分氧化为甲醛过程中的作用。第一系列通过常规的含水浸渍七钼酸铵制备，产生了两种钼物种：四面体单体Mo(VI)和八面体配位多钼酸盐。当钼负载高于1.3 wt.%时，多钼酸盐物种占主导，导致分散度下降和HZSM-5沸石通道的部分堵塞。第二系列通过含水浸渍后用氨水溶液洗涤制备，得到主要由四面体单体物种构成的分散良好的钼氧化物相。两个催化剂系列在甲烷转化中的活性不同。多钼酸盐物种在甲烷活化中更活跃，但导致甲醛选择性较低，而处理后的催化剂显示较低的甲烷转化率，但甲醛选择性较高。这些结果证明了单体物种的Mo=O位点在甲醛生产中的特异性。
