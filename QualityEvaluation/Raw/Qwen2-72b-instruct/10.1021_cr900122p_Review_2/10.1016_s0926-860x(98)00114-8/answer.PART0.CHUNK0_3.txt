[1] "The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu- able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the eld of catalysis [13]."
[2] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."
[4] "Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst."
[5] "In this paper, we report the results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as oxidant."
[6] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

1.将甲烷催化转化为更有价值的液体燃料仍然是催化领域的一个挑战性问题。
2.直接部分氧化甲烷为C1含氧化合物、甲醛或甲醇已经被广泛研究，因为它有可能替代传统的三步工业过程。
3.金属氧化物相的性质和分散度对催化剂的行为有重大影响。
4.Banares等人报告说，使用MoO3/SiO2催化剂在甲烷转化率为0.6%时，选择性超过90%。
5.本文报道了使用分子氧作为氧化剂，在W/HZSM-5催化剂上部分氧化甲烷为甲醛的结果。
6.甲醛的选择性似乎与钨氧化物相的分散度有关，而钨氧化物相的分散度又受到金属负载量的影响。
