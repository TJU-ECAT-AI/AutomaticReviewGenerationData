1.The catalytic conversion of methane to more valuable liquid fuels is a significant challenge in the field of catalysis. Direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, is a widely studied route that could potentially replace the conventional three-step industrial process. The nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a significant impact on the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. reported formaldehyde selectivities above 90% at a methane conversion of 0.6% using a MoO3/SiO2 catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly influence the behavior of catalysts. Banares et al. and Faraldos et al. have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of surface species. This paper reports the results of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

1.将甲烷催化转化为更有价值的液体燃料是催化领域的一个重大挑战。直接将甲烷部分氧化为C1氧酸，如甲醛或甲醇，是一种广泛研究的途径，有可能取代传统的三步工业过程。金属氧化物相的性质和分散性对催化剂的行为有重大影响。Banares等人报道，在甲烷转化率为0.6%时，使用MoO3/SiO2催化剂，甲醛选择性超过90%。已经证明，金属氧化物相的性质和分散性对催化剂的行为有重大影响。Banares等人和Faraldos等人报告说，甲烷转化率和甲醛选择性取决于金属负载和表面物种的分散性。本文报道了使用分子氧作为氧化剂，在W/HZSM-5催化剂上将甲烷部分氧化为甲醛的结果。甲醛选择性似乎与钨氧化物相的分散性有关，而钨氧化物相的分散性又受到金属负载的影响。
