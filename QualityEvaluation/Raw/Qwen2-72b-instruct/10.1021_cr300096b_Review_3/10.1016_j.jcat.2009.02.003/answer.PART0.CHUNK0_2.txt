[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
[2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation techniques and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques are widely used but may not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is crucial for the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts. RDP, on the other hand, is a promising technique that involves the deposition of the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal, leading to a close interaction between the two metals. RDP has shown advantages in catalytic performance, but detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and the active metal has been lacking.

1.用于制备负载型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括浸渍技术和还原沉积沉淀(RDP)。浸渍技术虽然广泛使用，但不一定能实现两种金属之间的紧密接触，这是双金属催化剂效果的关键。另一方面，RDP是一种有前景的技术，涉及通过第一种金属催化的氧化还原化学沉积第二种金属，从而实现两种金属之间的紧密相互作用。RDP在催化性能方面显示出优势，但对促进剂与活性金属之间相互作用的详细表征一直缺乏。
