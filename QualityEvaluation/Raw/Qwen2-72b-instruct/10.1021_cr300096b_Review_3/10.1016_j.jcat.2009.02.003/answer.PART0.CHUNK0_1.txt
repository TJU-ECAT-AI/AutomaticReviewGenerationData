[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
[2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques are widely used but may not ensure a close contact between the two metals, which is crucial for optimal catalytic performance. RDP, on the other hand, involves the deposition of the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal, leading to a closer interaction between the metals. RDP has shown advantages in catalytic performance, but detailed characterization of the metal interaction is still lacking.

1.用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括浸渍和还原沉积沉淀(RDP)。浸渍技术虽然广泛使用，但可能无法确保两种金属之间的紧密接触，这对最佳催化性能至关重要。另一方面，RDP涉及通过第一金属催化的氧化还原化学沉积第二种金属，从而导致金属之间的更紧密相互作用。RDP在催化性能方面显示出优势，但对金属相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。
