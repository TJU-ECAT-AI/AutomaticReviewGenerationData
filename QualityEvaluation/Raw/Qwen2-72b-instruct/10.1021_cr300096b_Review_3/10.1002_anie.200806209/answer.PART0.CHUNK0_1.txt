[1] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing,5 chemical leaching of the non-noble material,68 or electrochemical deposition techniques.9,10 All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."

[2] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."

1.Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have disadvantages such as loss of active surface area and material, formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the need for potential control during preparation. A novel method using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect has been developed to overcome these issues.
