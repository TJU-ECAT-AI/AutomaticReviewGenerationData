          [1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
          [2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
          [3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles through the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method results in close contact between promoters and active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has also been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, leading to shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods.

          支撑双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。IMP和离子交换方法虽然简单，但制备的催化剂活性通常较差，与更复杂的方法如HDP和RDP相比。RDP方法涉及将氢吸附在预还原的母体金属催化剂上，然后通过吸附氢还原促进剂前体，在预形成的金属纳米颗粒上沉积促进剂。这种方法使促进剂与活性中心紧密接触，导致有利的催化性能。还提出了一种新型的制备方法，即微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR），用于合成基于Pt的电催化剂。这种方法允许在几秒钟内将金属前体均匀加热到高温，与传统方法相比，导致更短的结晶时间和更均匀的成核。
