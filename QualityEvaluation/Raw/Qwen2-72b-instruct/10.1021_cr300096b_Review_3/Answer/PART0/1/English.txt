The literature does not provide a comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. It does, however, describe two methods used in the preparation of cobalt and cobalt-platinum catalysts: classical impregnation and an ammonia method. The ammonia method leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports used in the study, silica (SiO2) and synthetic kenyaite. This method also results in the formation of hardly reducible cobalt silicate phases predominantly on the SiO2 support. The Co3O4 particle size varies between 5 and 20 nm, depending on the support. The monometallic Co samples prepared by the ammonia method on both supports are more active in benzene combustion than the impregnated ones due to the finer dispersion of the easily reducible Co3O4. Addition of Pt improves the activity and the promoting effect is more evident for the impregnated sample. This is explained with the synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of the bimetallic kenyaite-supported samples is attributed to the stronger interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process. The ammonia method is advantageous for achieving higher catalytic activity in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation due to the finer dispersion of easily reducible Co3O4.

Various methods have been proposed for the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, including electrochemical deposition, chemical reduction, hydrolysis, vacuum deposition, and colloidal methods. Each method has its own potential advantages and applications in catalyst production. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition, which is difficult to achieve with other techniques.

Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have disadvantages such as loss of active surface area and material, formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the need for potential control during preparation. A novel method using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect has been developed to overcome these issues.

The literature describes methods for preparing bimetallic dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) that can be immobilized on supports using a co-complexation route to form alloy-type bimetallics or a sequential dendrimer-templating approach to create core/shell structures. These methods offer advantages such as control over the size and composition of the nanoparticles, stability of the DENs, and enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for hydrogenation and carbon-coupling reactions. Another method involves incorporating DENs into sol-gel matrices and calcining the composites to remove the dendrimer, minimizing particle growth and retaining the size and chemical composition of individual particles. The literature also discusses synthesizing bimetallic DENs through co-complexation of two different metal ions or through redox displacement reactions, highlighting their stability and catalytic activity. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in terms of potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention several methods that have been reported in the literature, including precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method. The literature highlights the use of organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles as a method that offers excellent control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes, which can lead to more stable and active catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. The use of organometallic cluster precursors is highlighted as offering advantages in terms of control over particle size and bimetallic composition, leading to more active and selective catalysts. This method is demonstrated to be useful in the design of efficient ethanol steam reforming catalysts.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, uses microemulsions to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors. The reverse micelle method has the potential to improve nanoparticle size uniformity and control, which can enhance the understanding of catalyst activity. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in catalyst production, but reverse micelle synthesis is particularly noted for its ability to produce uniform nanoparticles and improve hydrogenation activity.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation techniques and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques are widely used but may not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is crucial for the catalytic performance. RDP, on the other hand, is a promising technique that involves the deposition of the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal, leading to a close interaction between the two metals. RDP has shown advantages in catalytic performance, but detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and the active metal is still lacking.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method and the one-step route. The two-step method is general but complicated, while the one-step route is simpler and more efficient. The one-step method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au NPs, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form Co shells. This method has been applied to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs and non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs. Other reducing agents, such as octadecylamine (ODA), bayberry tannin (BT), and ascorbic acid, have also been used in one-step synthesis methods for bimetallic coreshell NPs. The choice of reducing agent is crucial for the success of the synthesis. The one-step route has the potential advantages of being simpler, more efficient, and more general than the two-step method. It can be applied to synthesize various bimetallic coreshell NPs with different compositions and morphologies. The impregnation/co-reduction method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. The successive two-step reduction method involves the deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs, which is effective but requires the pre-formed metal NPs to be chemically surrounded by the deposited element. These methods have potential advantages in terms of their ability to tune the properties of the catalysts by controlling their chemical composition and the relative sizes of the core and shell. They are widely applied in various catalytic reactions due to the synergistic effects between the two metals.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include wet impregnation, slurry synthesis, organometallic cluster precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer support synthesis, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), and laser vaporization. Wet impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. Slurry synthesis is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors help in achieving higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition allows for targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a transition metal core and a shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis produces supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. MAPR allows for very rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, morphology, and composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation methods. These methods have been widely used in industrial processes due to the beneficial modifications in activity, selectivity, and stability that can be achieved by including additional metals. However, these traditional methodologies often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. This complex mixture of particles leads to poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes it virtually impossible to establish definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step, usually reduction. However, this method can lead to chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support. A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing, but this risks possible excessive sintering. Some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution, but particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions. Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst. A different approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. This method has been used in past studies, particularly with mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors. In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal. These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles through the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method results in close contact between promoters and active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has also been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, leading to shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, uses microemulsions to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors. The reverse micelle method has the potential to improve nanoparticle size uniformity and control, which can enhance the understanding of catalyst activity. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in catalyst production, but reverse micelle synthesis is particularly noted for its ability to produce uniform nanoparticles and improve hydrogenation activity.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation techniques and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques are widely used but may not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is crucial for the catalytic performance. RDP, on the other hand, is a promising technique that involves the deposition of the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal, leading to a close interaction between the two metals. RDP has shown advantages in catalytic performance, but detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and the active metal is still lacking.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method and the one-step route. The two-step method is general but complicated, while the one-step route is simpler and more efficient. The one-step method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au NPs, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form Co shells. This method has been applied to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs and non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs. Other reducing agents, such as octadecylamine (ODA), bayberry tannin (BT), and ascorbic acid, have also been used in one-step synthesis methods for bimetallic coreshell NPs. The choice of reducing agent is crucial for the success of the synthesis. The one-step route has the potential advantages of being simpler, more efficient, and more general than the two-step method. It can be applied to synthesize various bimetallic coreshell NPs with different compositions and morphologies. The impregnation/co-reduction method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. The successive two-step reduction method involves the deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs, which is effective but requires the pre-formed metal NPs to be chemically surrounded by the deposited element. These methods have potential advantages in terms of their ability to tune the properties of the catalysts by controlling their chemical composition and the relative sizes of the core and shell. They are widely applied in various catalytic reactions due to the synergistic effects between the two metals.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include wet impregnation, slurry synthesis, organometallic cluster precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer support synthesis, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), and laser vaporization. Wet impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. Slurry synthesis is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors help in achieving higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition allows for targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a transition metal core and a shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis produces supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. MAPR allows for very rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, morphology, and composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation methods. These methods have been widely used in industrial processes due to the beneficial modifications in activity, selectivity, and stability that can be achieved by including additional metals. However, these traditional methodologies often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. This complex mixture of particles leads to poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes it virtually impossible to establish definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step, usually reduction. However, this method can lead to chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support. A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing, but this risks possible excessive sintering. Some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution, but particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions. Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst. A different approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. This method has been used in past studies, particularly with mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors. In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal. These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles through the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method results in close contact between promoters and active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has also been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, leading to shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods.

The literature does not provide a comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. It does, however, describe two methods used in the preparation of cobalt and cobalt-platinum catalysts: classical impregnation and an ammonia method. The ammonia method leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports used in the study, silica (SiO2) and synthetic kenyaite. This method also results in the formation of hardly reducible cobalt silicate phases predominantly on the SiO2 support. The Co3O4 particle size varies between 5 and 20 nm, depending on the support. The monometallic Co samples prepared by the ammonia method on both supports are more active in benzene combustion than the impregnated ones due to the finer dispersion of the easily reducible Co3O4. Addition of Pt improves the activity and the promoting effect is more evident for the impregnated sample. This is explained with the synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of the bimetallic kenyaite-supported samples is attributed to the stronger interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process. The ammonia method is advantageous for achieving higher catalytic activity in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation due to the finer dispersion of easily reducible Co3O4.

Various methods have been proposed for the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, including electrochemical deposition, chemical reduction, hydrolysis, vacuum deposition, and colloidal methods. Each method has its own potential advantages and applications in catalyst production. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition, which is difficult to achieve with other techniques.

Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have disadvantages such as loss of active surface area and material, formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the need for potential control during preparation. A novel method using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect has been developed to overcome these issues.

The literature describes methods for preparing bimetallic dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) that can be immobilized on supports using a co-complexation route to form alloy-type bimetallics or a sequential dendrimer-templating approach to create core/shell structures. These methods offer advantages such as control over the size and composition of the nanoparticles, stability of the DENs, and enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for hydrogenation and carbon-coupling reactions. Another method involves incorporating DENs into sol-gel matrices and calcining the composites to remove the dendrimer, minimizing particle growth and retaining the size and chemical composition of individual particles. The literature also discusses synthesizing bimetallic DENs through co-complexation of two different metal ions or through redox displacement reactions, highlighting their stability and catalytic activity. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in terms of potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention several methods that have been reported in the literature, including precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method. The literature highlights the use of organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles as a method that offers excellent control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes, which can lead to more stable and active catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

Wet impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. Slurry synthesis is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors help in achieving higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition allows for targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a transition metal core and a shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis produces supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. MAPR allows for very rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, morphology, and composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation methods. These methods have been widely used in industrial processes due to the beneficial modifications in activity, selectivity, and stability that can be achieved by including additional metals. However, these traditional methodologies often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. This complex mixture of particles leads to poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes it virtually impossible to establish definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step, usually reduction. However, this method can lead to chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support. A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing, but this risks possible excessive sintering. Some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution, but particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions. Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst. A different approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. This method has been used in past studies, particularly with mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors. In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal. These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles through the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method results in close contact between promoters and active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has also been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, leading to shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods.
