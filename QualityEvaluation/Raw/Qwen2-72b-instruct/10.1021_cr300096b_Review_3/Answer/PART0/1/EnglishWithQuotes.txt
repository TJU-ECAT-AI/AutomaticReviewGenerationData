It does, however, describe two methods used in the preparation of cobalt and cobalt-platinum catalysts: classical impregnation and an ammonia method. The ammonia method leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports used in the study, silica (SiO2) and synthetic kenyaite. This method also results in the formation of hardly reducible cobalt silicate phases predominantly on the SiO2 support. The Co3O4 particle size varies between 5 and 20 nm, depending on the support. The monometallic Co samples prepared by the ammonia method on both supports are more active in benzene combustion than the impregnated ones due to the finer dispersion of the easily reducible Co3O4. Addition of Pt improves the activity and the promoting effect is more evident for the impregnated sample. This is explained with the synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of the bimetallic kenyaite-supported samples is attributed to the stronger interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process.

A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing, but this risks possible excessive sintering. Some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution, but particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions. Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst. A different approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. This method has been used in past studies, particularly with mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors. In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal.
