          [1] "An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite [18] . Other techniques proposed include chemical reduction [15] , hydrolysis [16] , vacuum deposition [17] , and colloidal methods [19] ."

[1] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing,5 chemical leaching of the non-noble material,68 or electrochemical deposition techniques.9,10 All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
          [2] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."





[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."
          [2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
          [4] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."
          [5] "The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles [6] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."

          [12] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."
          [13] "These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4] ,[36] ."
          [14] "In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles."
          [15] "Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique."

[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
          [4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
          [2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
          [3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
          [4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
          [5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
          [6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
          [7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
          [8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
          [9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
          [10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
          [11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
          [12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
          [13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
          [14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
          [15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
          [16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
          [17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
          [18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."
          [19] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
          [20] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation.
          Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas.
          Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods.
          Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts.
          Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst.
          Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles.
          CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt.
          Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.
          Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm.
          Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds.
          Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition.

Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] .

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
          [2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."
          [3] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
          [4] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13)."
          [5] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
          [6] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."
          [7] "Past studies in this field have largely involved the use of mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors; several reviews on the subject are available (1522)."
          [8] "In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports (e.g., silica, alumina, magnesia, or zeolites) and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere."
          [9] "Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal (2325)."
          [10] "These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites (2325)."

[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
          [2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
          [3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."

[1] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing,5 chemical leaching of the non-noble material,68 or electrochemical deposition techniques.9,10 All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
          [2] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."





[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."
          [2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
          [4] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."

          [12] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."
          [13] "These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4] ,[36] ."
          [14] "In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles."
          [15] "Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique."

[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
          [4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
          [2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
          [3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
          [4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
          [5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
          [6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
          [7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
          [8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
          [9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
          [10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
          [11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
          [12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
          [13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
          [14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
          [15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
          [16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
          [17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
          [18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."
          [19] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
          [20] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation.
          Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas.
          Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods.
          Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts.
          Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst.
          Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles.
          CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt.
          Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.
          Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm.
          Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds.
          Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition.

Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] .

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
          [2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."
          [3] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
          [4] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13)."
          [5] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
          [6] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."
          [7] "Past studies in this field have largely involved the use of mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors; several reviews on the subject are available (1522)."
          [8] "In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports (e.g., silica, alumina, magnesia, or zeolites) and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere."
          [9] "Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal (2325)."
          [10] "These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites (2325)."

[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
          [2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
          [3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."



[1] "For these techniques, however, it is difficult to achieve a consistent alloy composition in the nanoparticles prepared. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition."
          [1] "An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite [18] .

[1] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing,5 chemical leaching of the non-noble material,68 or electrochemical deposition techniques.9,10 All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
          [2] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."





[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."
          [2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
          [4] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."

          [12] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."
          [13] "These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4] ,[36] ."
          [14] "In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles."
          [15] "Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique."

[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
          [4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
          [2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
          [3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
          [4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
          [5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
          [6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
          [7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
          [8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
          [9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
          [10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
          [11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
          [12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
          [13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
          [14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
          [15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
          [16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
          [17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
          [18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."
          [19] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
          [20] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation.
          Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas.
          Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods.
          Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts.
          Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst.
          Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles.
          CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt.
          Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.
          Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm.
          Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds.
          Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition.

Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] .

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
          [2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."
          [3] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
          [4] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13)."
          [5] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
          [6] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."
          [7] "Past studies in this field have largely involved the use of mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors; several reviews on the subject are available (1522)."
          [8] "In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports (e.g., silica, alumina, magnesia, or zeolites) and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere."
          [9] "Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal (2325)."
          [10] "These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites (2325)."

[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
          [2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
          [3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."



[1] "For these techniques, however, it is difficult to achieve a consistent alloy composition in the nanoparticles prepared. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition."
          [1] "An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite [18] .

[1] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing,5 chemical leaching of the non-noble material,68 or electrochemical deposition techniques.9,10 All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
          [2] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."





[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."
          [2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
          [4] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."
          [5] "The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles [6] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
          [6] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."
          [7] "Reverse micelle synthesis was used to improve the nanoparticle size uniformity of bimetallic Pt/Ni nanoparticles supported on Î³-Al2O3."
          [8] "These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [9] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."
          [10] "The reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."
          [11] "The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles [6] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."
          [12] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."
          [13] "These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4] ,[36] ."
          [14] "In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles."
          [15] "Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique."

[1] "Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation."
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal [11] . This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
          [4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated [13] ,[14] , detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
          [2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
          [3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
          [4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
          [5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
          [6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
          [7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
          [8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
          [9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
          [10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
          [11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
          [12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
          [13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
          [14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
          [15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
          [16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
          [17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
          [18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."
          [19] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
          [20] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation.
          Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas.
          Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods.
          Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts.
          Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst.
          Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles.
          CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt.
          Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.
          Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm.
          Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds.
          Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition.

Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] .

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
          [2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."
          [3] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
          [4] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13)."
          [5] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
          [6] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."
          [7] "Past studies in this field have largely involved the use of mono- and bimetallic carbonyl clusters as precursors; several reviews on the subject are available (1522)."
          [8] "In most studies, molecular cluster compounds were supported on various oxide supports (e.g., silica, alumina, magnesia, or zeolites) and subsequently decarbonylated by heating under vacuum or inert atmosphere."
          [9] "Further studies have shown that in some cases the structure of the metal core remains substantially intact after ligand removal (2325)."
          [10] "These well-defined metal cluster catalysts have been examined with a variety of probe reactions, the results of which have important implications toward the nature of catalytic active sites (2325)."

[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
          [2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
          [3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."
