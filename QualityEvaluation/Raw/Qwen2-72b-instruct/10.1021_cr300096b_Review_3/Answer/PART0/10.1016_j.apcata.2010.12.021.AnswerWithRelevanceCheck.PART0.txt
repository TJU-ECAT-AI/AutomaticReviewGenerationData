          [1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."
          [2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, uses microemulsions to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors. The reverse micelle method has the potential to improve nanoparticle size uniformity and control, which can enhance the understanding of catalyst activity. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in catalyst production, but reverse micelle synthesis is particularly noted for its ability to produce uniform nanoparticles and improve hydrogenation activity.

          用于支撑双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括初始湿性浸渍和反胶束合成。初始湿性浸渍涉及将金属盐溶解在等于或略小于支撑物孔体积的水体积中。浸渍后，催化剂通常会经历干燥、煅烧和/或加热处理，特别是为了将前体盐还原成金属纳米颗粒。然而，这些处理必须优化，以最小化金属颗粒的烧结和聚结。另一方面，反胶束合成使用微乳液通过化学还原金属前体来产生均匀的金属纳米颗粒。反胶束方法有潜力改善纳米粒子的大小均匀性和控制，从而增强对催化剂活性的理解。这两种方法在催化剂生产中都有各自的优势和应用，但反胶束合成特别因其能够产生均匀的纳米粒子并提高氢化活性而受到关注。
