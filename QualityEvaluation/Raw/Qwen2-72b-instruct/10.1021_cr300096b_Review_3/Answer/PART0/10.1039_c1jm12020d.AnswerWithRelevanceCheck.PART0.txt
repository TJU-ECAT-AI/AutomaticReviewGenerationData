          [1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
          [2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
          [3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
          [4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
          [5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
          [6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
          [7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
          [8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
          [9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
          [10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
          [11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
          [12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
          [13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
          [14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
          [15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
          [16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
          [17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
          [18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."
          [19] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
          [20] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method and the one-step route. The two-step method is general but complicated, while the one-step route is simpler and more efficient. The one-step method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au NPs, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form Co shells. This method has been applied to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs and non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs. Other reducing agents, such as octadecylamine (ODA), bayberry tannin (BT), and ascorbic acid, have also been used in one-step synthesis methods for bimetallic coreshell NPs. The choice of reducing agent is crucial for the success of the synthesis. The one-step route has the potential advantages of being simpler, more efficient, and more general than the two-step method. It can be applied to synthesize various bimetallic coreshell NPs with different compositions and morphologies. The impregnation/co-reduction method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. The successive two-step reduction method involves the deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs, which is effective but requires the pre-formed metal NPs to be chemically surrounded by the deposited element. These methods have potential advantages in terms of their ability to tune the properties of the catalysts by controlling their chemical composition and the relative sizes of the core and shell. They are widely applied in various catalytic reactions due to the synergistic effects between the two metals.

          用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括两步还原/外延生长法和一步法。两步法虽然通用，但较为复杂，而一步法则更简单、更高效。一步法涉及使用适合具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子的还原剂。例如，NH3BH3可以用来还原Au3+形成Au NPs，然后作为催化剂还原Co2+形成Co壳层。该方法已被用于制备可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳NPs和非贵金属基双金属核壳NPs。其他还原剂，如十八烷基胺（ODA）、五倍子鞣质（BT）和抗坏血酸，也已在一步合成方法中用于双金属核壳NPs。还原剂的选择对于合成的成功至关重要。一步法具有比两步法更简单、更高效、更通用的潜在优势。它可以应用于合成具有不同组成和形态的各种双金属核壳NPs。浸渍/共还原方法用于单金属NPs的合成，但双金属NPs会共引入两种金属前体。连续两步还原方法涉及将壳金属沉积在预形成的核金属NPs上，这很有效，但要求预形成的金属NPs被沉积的元素化学包围。这些方法在通过控制其化学组成和核心与壳的相对大小来调节催化剂的性质方面具有潜在优势。由于两种金属之间的协同效应，它们被广泛应用于各种催化反应中。
