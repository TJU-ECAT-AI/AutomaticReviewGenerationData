{"DOC": "Two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are classical impregnation and the ammonia method. The ammonia method yields finely dispersed Co3O4 on silica and synthetic kenyaite, enhancing catalytic activity in benzene combustion compared to impregnation. Monometallic Co samples prepared by the ammonia method exhibit higher activity due to finer dispersion. Adding Pt boosts activity, with a more pronounced effect on impregnated samples, attributed to the synergy between cobalt oxide and Pt.
