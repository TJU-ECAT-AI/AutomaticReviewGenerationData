2.2 Supported Catalysts
2.2.1 Synthesis of Supported Bimetallic Catalysts
Supported bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using a wide range of synthesis techniques. In this section we will provide a summary of some of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods and the potential advantages of each method.
Wet Impregnation Method
Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation. It involves infusing the desired support material with a solution containing a precursor of the desired metallic species. The support is impregnated with a volume of precursor solution that is equal to the pore volume of the support material. The amount of precursor required is calculated based on the desired metal loading for each catalyst, and the volume of the pores of the support material is measured prior to impregnation using deionized water. (137) To synthesize the catalyst, a known mass of a metal precursor is dissolved in a solvent. Deionized water is the most commonly used solvent for wet impregnation, but research groups have also used Pt&ndash;acetylacetonates dissolved in toluene to avoid acidification of the support, (138) ethylene glycol, (139) formic acid, (140) and acetone. (141) Catalysts can also be prepared with organometallic bimetallic molecular precursors. These precursors are advantageous to traditional metallic salts because the bimetallic bond is already present, leading to a higher extent of bimetallic bonds and a higher activity of bimetallic catalysts. (142)
Once the precursor is fully dissolved, the solution is added dropwise to the support. Capillary action carries the aqueous solution up into the pores of the support, where the metal precursor is deposited. By varying the drying rate of the catalyst, the precursor can deposit deep within the pores or solely at the pore entrances. After drying, the catalyst is calcined at high temperature to vaporize the nonmetallic components of the precursor salt, leaving the metal in an oxidized state on the support surface. Calcination is required to stabilize metals on the support surface and to prevent metal dissolution when exposed to moisture. Incipient wetness impregnation of bimetallic catalysts can be performed sequentially or simultaneously. In sequential impregnation, one metal is impregnated first, and then the catalyst is dried and calcined. After calcination, the second metal is impregnated to complete the catalyst synthesis. Sequential impregnation is preferred in cases where the metal precursors react with each other, but it has been shown that simultaneous impregnation of a bimetallic catalyst yields a greater extent of bimetallic bond formation and higher activity. (143) For example, Lonergan et al. have shown that Pt&ndash;Ni catalysts synthesized by simultaneous impregnation were more active for 1,3-butadiene and benzene hydrogenation than catalysts synthesized using sequential impregnation. (143)
Slurry Synthesis Method
This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas. The slurry is made with the support material, metal precursor, and water. The amounts of support and precursor are chosen to achieve the desired weight loading of catalyst, and typically ∼15 mL of deionized water is used for each gram of catalyst. After mixing the components, the slurry is stirred for at least 8 h, during which an equilibrium amount of the precursor should adsorb to the support. (144) During stirring, the pH value is controlled to a set level using NaOH. Once the set stirring time has elapsed, the slurry is filtered and washed and then placed in a drying oven to evaporate the excess water. Catalysts are calcined at high temperatures after drying to stabilize the metal on the support and to remove unwanted elements from the metal precursors. This synthesis method has been used to prepare catalysts for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics, which shows that adding a small amount of Pt to an Au/TiO2 catalyst increases the hydrogenation activity by an order of magnitude. (144)
Organometallic Cluster Precursors
Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods. (145) The dispersion of the active phase on the surface of a support is controlled by many factors, including the support type, method of preparation, calcination conditions, precursors, and metal loading. (146) A common problem of impregnation and slurry techniques is the separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support, preventing the effective formation of the bimetallic bonds. An improved method to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then thermally remove the ligands. (147) For example, a bimetallic cluster, [(PPh3)Pt(AuPPh3)6](NO3)2, is used to prepare a Pt&ndash;Au catalyst particle, previously described in detail for different bimetallic precursors. (148) The organometallic cluster is mixed with an organic solvent such as CH2Cl2, and the cluster solution is slowly added to the oxide support with constant swirling. The clusters are spontaneously adsorbed onto the oxide support, and the remaining solvent is decanted. Residual solvent is removed by heating in vacuum, and the clusters are activated by heating in oxygen up to 573 K. Studies have shown that the bimetallic core of the cluster remains intact while the ligands are removed after heating. (145) In probe reactions of ethanol reforming, bimetallic catalysts synthesized with organometallic clusters outperformed catalysts synthesized using traditional impregnation methods. (149)
Reductive Deposition Precipitation
This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. It is an alternative to the organometallic precursor method, which sometimes experiences premature decomposition of the organometallic complex, leading to inactive phases on the catalyst support. (140) In reductive deposition precipitation, a monometallic catalyst, for example, Pt, is prepared by conventional wet impregnation or slurry methods and then held under hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Pt particles react with a second metal precursor, resulting in the formation of a bimetallic surface complex. The surface complex is decomposed in hydrogen, leading to formation of a stabilized bimetallic species. (150) However, this method does not exclusively lead to formation of bimetallic particles, with some of the second metal precursor also depositing on the support. (151) Ekou et al. have shown that Pt&ndash;Ge/TiO2 catalysts synthesized using the reductive deposition precipitation method are active for the selective hydrogenation of citral into unsaturated alcohols. (152)
Electroless Deposition
This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. This method is used for the synthesis of Pt&ndash;Ag bimetallic catalysts. (153) A preprepared Pt catalyst is suspended in deionized water with a second metal source (AgNO3), an ionic strength adjuster (NaNO3), a reducing agent (HCHO), and NaOH or HNO3 to adjust the solution pH. The mixture is stirred for 2 h while the pH is kept at 9 by small additions of NaOH or HNO3. After deposition, the slurry is filtered and washed to remove excess ions, then fully dried. Results indicate that Ag deposition is restricted to the Pt surface and does not readily occur on the catalyst support. (153) For hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB), the addition of Ag to a monometallic Pt catalyst increases the activity by ∼3 times. The effect of Ag addition is not as pronounced on the catalyst prepared using impregnation, indicating that electroless deposition leads to targeted placement of Ag on the Pt surface. (153)
Colloidal Synthesis
This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles. The metallic colloid is prepared by making a solution of metal precursors, such as K2PtCl4 for Pt, in the presence of a cationic surfactant such as C14TABr. For bimetallic synthesis, precursors of both metals are mixed with the surfactant. The interaction between the precursor metal anions and the surfactant cation in aqueous solution leads to the formation of an organic metal precursor. The reactants are then stirred vigorously and heated to 323 K upon addition of NaBH4, a reducing agent. After reaction, the metallic particles are precipitated and washed in decreasing concentration of ethanol and increasing concentration of water until the particles are filtered and stored. (154) To prepare a supported catalyst, the metallic nanoparticles are added to the desired support in chloroform and sonicated for several hours. The suspension is centrifuged and washed with an acetone&ndash;ethanol mixture and then dried in an oven. (155) It is important to point out that the removal of carbon from the surfactants and colloids is critical for the utilization of these materials for catalytic applications. In particular, further studies are needed to identify procedures for carbon removal without changing the structure and surface morphology of the catalysts. Pt&ndash;Co catalysts prepared by this method and supported on mesoporous silica have been used for CO2 hydrogenation into CO and CH4 between 473 and 573 K. (155)
Core&ndash;Shell Synthesis
Core&ndash;shell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 1&ndash;2 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt. The transition metal core is prepared by dissolving a metallic chloride precursor in ethylene glycol with polyvinyl alcohol as a surfactant, while holding the solution under nitrogen. The solution is heated and the metal precursor is reduced by dropwise addition of NaBH4. After reaction, the colloid is quenched on ice, centrifuged in an acetone&ndash;ethanol mixture, and then dispersed in ethylene glycol. (156) To form the Pt shells, PtCl2 is dissolved in ethylene glycol at room temperature. With a syringe, a small amount of the metallic nanoparticle suspension is added to the PtCl2 solution. The mixture is often heated and held at elevated temperatures before quenching in an ice bath. The supported catalysts are formed by adding an oxide support to the colloidal suspension and drying the slurries in vacuum. Pt@Ru core&ndash;shell nanoparticles synthesized with this method were shown to be more active than their constituent pure metal nanoparticles, as well as their nanoalloys synthesized from conventional methods for CO oxidation in hydrogen. (156)
For core&ndash;shell systems, it is also desirable to synthesize catalysts with a low-cost transition metal core and Pt or other precious metals at the outermost layer. Mayrhofer et al. have found that, in PtCo@Pt core&ndash;shell nanoparticles, Pt segregates to the surface under a CO environment. (157) Another study with a M@Pt (M = Ni, Co) system shows high activity for hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). (158) Fe@Pt NPs supported on carbon have also been used for NH3BH3 oxidation. These catalysts are low cost, highly stable, and much more active than the commercial Pt/C catalysts used for NH3BH3 oxidation. (159)
Reverse Micelle Synthesis
This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The microemulsion is formed by dissolving a small amount of a metal precursor in an aqueous environment inside of a nonionic surfactant. Upon addition of a reducing agent, such as hydrazine (N2H4), the metal precursors are chemically reduced, leaving nanosized metallic particles. (160) Synthesis of supported catalysts begins by mixing an aqueous solution with the metal precursor and surfactant with an oil-phase solution of the reducing agent. Under stirring, the solution becomes clear, indicating the formation of reverse micelles. A metal oxide support is added as the solution is titrated with acetone to disrupt the micelles, leading to the adsorption of micelles to the support. (161) Reverse micelle synthesis is a useful technique because the size of the metallic nanoparticles can be directly controlled by the ratio of water to surfactant. The amount of reducing agent can also influence the size of particles by increasing the nucleation rate and, thus, decreasing the particle size. (160) Pt&ndash;Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts synthesized using this method exhibit increased activity over their parent metals for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation due to an enhanced bimetallic effect. (162)
Dendrimer Support Synthesis
Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 1&ndash;2 nm. This synthesis method overcomes the weakness of traditional impregnation techniques, which tend to make nanoparticles with wide size distributions. (163) Dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) are synthesized by extracting metal ions into the interior of dendrimers and then chemically reducing the metal ions to form monodisperse particles that are <3 nm in diameter. (164) DENs are prepared by adding a low concentration of K2PtCl4, or another metallic precursor, to an aqueous solution of hydroxyl-terminated dendrimers. The generation (size) of the dendrimers can be used to directly control the size of the metallic nanoparticles. After adding the metal precursor to the dendrimer solution and stirring for 3 days, the solution is purged with N2 and then chemically reduced with NaBH4 overnight. The metallic nanoparticles are removed by dialysis and then filtered. (165) Once the solution of metallic nanoparticles is obtained, the particles can be deposited on a support by impregnation. Catalysts synthesized with dendrimer supports have been tested in several catalytic applications including hydrogenation (164) and CO oxidation. (163)
Other Synthesis Methods
Several other synthesis techniques have been employed to synthesize supported catalysts. Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds. This shortens the crystallization period of the metal nanoparticles, leading to more homogeneous nucleation when compared to traditional synthesis methods. In MAPR synthesis, the support is immersed in an aqueous metal precursor solution and then dried in vacuum. (166) The MAPR method can be applied to bimetallic catalysts by adding a second metal precursor to the aqueous solution. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have been successfully synthesized using the MAPR method with high activity and selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, with the MAPR catalysts outperforming catalysts synthesized by the conventional impregnation method. (166)
Another interesting approach is to directly deposit metal on an oxide support on the reactor wall. The reactor consists of an Fe&ndash;Cr&ndash;Al cylinder placed in a stainless steel tube, which is heated to high temperatures to produce a γ-Al2O3 film on the surface of the cylinder. (167) To prepare the supported catalyst, the Fe&ndash;Cr&ndash;Al alloy cylinder is dipped into a slurry of metallic precursors until the desired loading is reached, followed by drying and calcining the alloy cylinder. (167) The advantage of this synthesis process is that the catalyst is formed directly on the walls of the reactor, allowing for high loading and potentially uniform catalyst deposition. This approach has been used for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich gas streams, leading to a reduction of CO in the feed from 1% to <10 ppm. (167)
Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition. In the laser-vaporization technique, a low-energy Nd:YAG pulsed laser vaporizes a metal of interest from a rod to create a plasma. Crystal growth begins by introducing a continuous flow of He or Ar into the evaporation chamber, leading to the deposition of metal clusters onto the catalyst support. These clusters are highly uniform in size and composition as they are fully formed before they are deposited onto the support. (168) Although the quantity of the catalysts produced in this method is relatively small, these samples offer the opportunity for obtaining fundamental correlations between catalytic properties and the size, shape, and composition of bimetallic catalysts. Pt&ndash;Pd/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by laser vaporization show similar trends as catalysts prepared by traditional methods for toluene hydrogenation. (168)

A comprehensive analysis of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts reveals that the ammonia method, compared to classical impregnation, yields finer dispersion of Co3O4 on silica and synthetic kenyaite, enhancing catalytic activity in benzene combustion \[10.1007/s10853-006-0894-x\]. The addition of Pt further boosts activity, with a more pronounced effect on impregnated samples due to synergy between cobalt oxide and Pt. Microemulsion preparation offers precise control over nanoparticle size and composition, an advantage lacking in other techniques \[10.1016/s0022-0728(04)00328-6\]. A novel adsorbate-induced surface segregation technique overcomes challenges faced by high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching, and electrochemical deposition, offering a significant advantage in catalyst production \[10.1002/anie.200806209\]. Co-complexation for alloy-type bimetallics, sequential dendrimer-templating for core/shell structures, and integrating dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) into sol-gel matrices offer control over nanoparticle size and composition, stability, and enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for hydrogenation and carbon-coupling reactions \[10.1021/jp0469665\]. Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles offer superior control over bimetallic composition and particle size, leading to more stable and active catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and efficient ethanol steam reforming \[10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.044\]. Reverse micelle synthesis, involving microemulsions for uniform nanoparticle production, offers improved size control \[10.1016/j.apcata.2010.12.021\]. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), by contrast, deposits the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first, promoting better metal interaction and showing enhanced catalytic performance \[10.1016/j.jcat.2009.02.003\]. The one-step synthesis method, using reducing agents like NH3BH3, ODA, BT, and ascorbic acid, is simpler and more efficient than the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method, offering advantages in simplicity, efficiency, and generality \[10.1039/c1jm12020d\].
                
                Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel synthesis techniques that combine the advantages of various methods, such as the precise control of microemulsion preparation with the enhanced catalytic performance of RDP. The exploration of new reducing agents for one-step synthesis methods could also lead to the creation of bimetallic catalysts with unprecedented properties. Additionally, the integration of computational modeling and machine learning could aid in the design of catalysts with optimized composition and structure, potentially revolutionizing the field of catalysis. The use of sustainable and eco-friendly synthesis methods, such as microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), could also be prioritized to address environmental concerns in catalyst production.
