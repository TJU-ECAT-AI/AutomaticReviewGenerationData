{"DOC": "In the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, the ammonia method and classical impregnation are compared. The ammonia method yields finely dispersed Co3O4 on silica and synthetic kenyaite, with particle sizes varying based on the support. Monometallic Co samples prepared by this method exhibit higher activity in benzene combustion due to finer dispersion. Pt addition boosts activity, with a more pronounced effect on impregnated samples, attributed to the synergy between cobalt oxide and Pt.
