NH3BH3 reduces Au3+ to form Au NPs, which catalyze Co2+ reduction to Co shells, creating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs. This method is also applicable to non-noble metal-based coreshell NPs. Octadecylamine (ODA), bayberry tannin (BT), and ascorbic acid have been used in one-step synthesis for AuNi, Au@Pd, and Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs, respectively. The choice of reducing agent is critical.
