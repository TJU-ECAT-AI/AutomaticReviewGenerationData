[1] "Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."
[2] "Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas."
[3] "An improved method to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then thermally remove the ligands."
[4] "Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts."
[5] "Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst."
[6] "Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."
[7] "CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt."
[8] "Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution."
[9] "Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm."
[10] "Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds."
[11] "Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation, slurry synthesis, adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer support synthesis, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), and laser vaporization. Incipient wetness impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. The slurry synthesis method is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas. Adsorbing ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support improves the uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition uses a controlled chemical reaction to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis allows for precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis involves a transition metal core covered with a monolayer shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse particles. MAPR allows for very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of the same size, morphology, and composition.
