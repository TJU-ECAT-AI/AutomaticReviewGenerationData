[1] "Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."
[2] "Slurry Synthesis Method This method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas."
[3] "Organometallic Cluster Precursors Metal segregation, sintering, surface enrichment of one of the metals, and the inherent heterogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation and slurry methods."
[4] "Reductive Deposition Precipitation This is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts."
[5] "Electroless Deposition This method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst."
[6] "Colloidal Synthesis This method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."
[7] "CoreShell Synthesis Coreshell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 12 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt."
[8] "Reverse Micelle Synthesis This method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution."
[9] "Dendrimer Support Synthesis Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm."
[10] "Microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) allows very rapid uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds."
[11] "Finally, laser vaporization has been used to synthesize monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of approximately the same size, morphology, and composition."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include wet impregnation, slurry synthesis, organometallic cluster precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer support synthesis, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), and laser vaporization. Wet impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. Slurry synthesis is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors help in achieving higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition allows for targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a transition metal core and a shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis produces supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse metallic nanoparticles. MAPR allows for very rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, morphology, and composition.
