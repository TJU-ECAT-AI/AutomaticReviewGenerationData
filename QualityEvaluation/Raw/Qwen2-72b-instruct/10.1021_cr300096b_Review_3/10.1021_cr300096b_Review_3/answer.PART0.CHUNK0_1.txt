1.Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly used method for its simplicity in sample preparation. It is suitable for catalysts with low metal loadings and high surface area supports. Slurry synthesis is used for catalysts with high metal loadings or low surface area supports. Adsorbing ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then removing the ligands thermally can achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition uses a controlled chemical reaction to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis allows for precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles. CoreShell synthesis creates a transition metal core covered with a monolayer shell of another metal. Reverse micelle synthesis uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse particles. Microwave-assisted polyol reduction allows for rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, morphology, and composition.
