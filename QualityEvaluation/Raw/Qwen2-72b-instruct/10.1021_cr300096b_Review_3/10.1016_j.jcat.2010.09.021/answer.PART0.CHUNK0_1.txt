1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but result in catalysts with poorer activities compared to those prepared by more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method leads to close contact between promoters and main active centers, which is favorable for catalytic properties in selective hydrogenation. Recently, a novel preparation method called microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) has been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within a few seconds, resulting in shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional preparation methods.

1. 支撑双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。离子交换和浸渍方法虽然简单，但制备的催化剂活性通常较差，与更复杂的方法如HDP和RDP相比。在RDP方法中，氢气被吸附在预还原的母体金属催化剂上，然后通过吸附氢气还原促进剂前体，在预形成的金属纳米颗粒上沉积促进剂。这种方法使促进剂与主要活性中心紧密接触，有利于选择性氢化中的催化性能。最近，一种称为微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）的新合成方法被提出，用于合成用于燃料电池的Pt基电催化剂。该方法允许在几秒钟内将金属前体均匀加热到高温，与传统制备方法相比，导致更短的结晶时间和更均匀的成核。
