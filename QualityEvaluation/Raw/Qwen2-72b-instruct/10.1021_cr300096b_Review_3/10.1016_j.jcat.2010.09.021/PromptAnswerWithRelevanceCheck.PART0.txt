[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."
[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen [11] ."
[3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells [12] ,[13] . Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods [13] ."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method leads to close contact between promoters and active centers, enhancing catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, resulting in shorter crystallization times and more homogenous nucleation compared to conventional methods.

1. 支撑双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。IMP和离子交换方法虽然简单，但与更复杂的方法如HDP和RDP相比，所制备的催化剂活性较差。RDP方法涉及将氢气吸附在预还原的母体金属催化剂上，然后通过吸附氢气还原促进剂前体，将促进剂沉积在预形成的金属纳米颗粒上。这种方法使促进剂与活性中心紧密接触，增强催化性能。最近，提出了一种新型的制备方法，即微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR），用于合成基于Pt的电催化剂。这种方法允许金属前体在几秒钟内均匀加热到高温，与传统方法相比，导致更短的结晶时间和更均匀的成核。

The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method leads to close contact between promoters and main active centers, which is favorable for catalytic properties in selective hydrogenation. Recently, a novel preparation method called microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) has been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within a few seconds, resulting in shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional preparation methods.
