[1] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) [8] ."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). The IMP and ion-exchange methods are simple but result in poorer catalyst activities compared to more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst and then depositing promoters on pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method leads to close contact between promoters and active centers, enhancing catalytic properties. A novel preparation method, microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR), has been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts. This method allows for uniform heating of metal precursors to high temperatures within seconds, resulting in shorter crystallization times and more homogenous nucleation compared to conventional methods.

1. 支撑双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。IMP和离子交换方法虽然简单，但与更复杂的方法如HDP和RDP相比，所制备的催化剂活性较差。RDP方法涉及将氢气吸附在预还原的母体金属催化剂上，然后通过吸附氢气还原促进剂前体，将促进剂沉积在预形成的金属纳米颗粒上。这种方法使促进剂与活性中心紧密接触，增强催化性能。最近，提出了一种新型的制备方法，即微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR），用于合成基于Pt的电催化剂。这种方法允许金属前体在几秒钟内均匀加热到高温，与传统方法相比，导致更短的结晶时间和更均匀的成核。
