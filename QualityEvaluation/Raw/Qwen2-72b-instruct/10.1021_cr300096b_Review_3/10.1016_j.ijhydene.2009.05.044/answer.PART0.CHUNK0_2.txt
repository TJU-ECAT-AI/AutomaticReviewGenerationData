1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention several methods that have been reported in the literature, including precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method. The literature highlights the advantages of using organometallic cluster precursors for the preparation of supported bimetallic catalysts, which include better control of particle size and bimetallic composition, higher dispersion, and improved catalytic performance.
