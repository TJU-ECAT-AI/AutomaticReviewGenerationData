1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention various methods such as precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. The use of organometallic cluster precursors is highlighted as offering advantages in terms of control over particle size and bimetallic composition, leading to more active and selective catalysts.
