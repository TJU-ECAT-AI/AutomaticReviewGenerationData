1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention several methods such as precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently reported method. The literature highlights the use of organometallic cluster precursors for the preparation of bimetallic catalysts, which offers advantages in terms of control over particle size and bimetallic composition. This method is demonstrated to be useful in the design of efficient ethanol steam reforming catalysts.

1.文献没有直接比较用于制备双金属催化剂的合成方法。但是，它确实提到了几种方法，如沉淀、沉积-沉淀、共沉淀、溶胶-凝胶、声化学和初始湿性浸渍。其中，初始湿性浸渍是最常报道的方法。文献强调了使用有机金属簇前体制备双金属催化剂的优点，这在控制颗粒尺寸和双金属组成方面提供了优势。这种方法被证明在设计高效的乙醇蒸汽重整催化剂方面是有用的。
