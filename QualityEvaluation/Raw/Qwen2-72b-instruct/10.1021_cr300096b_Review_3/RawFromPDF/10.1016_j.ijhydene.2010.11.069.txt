We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x ¼ 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67,
and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia
borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic
acid as the surfactant. The structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the
obtained samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), inductively coupled
plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results
show that the Ni coreePt shell nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the carbon surface
with the diameters of 2e4 nm, and furthermore, the catalysts show favorable performance
toward the hydrolysis of NH3BH3. Among the nanoparticles, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C displays the
highest catalytic activity, delivering a high hydrogen release rate of 5469 mL min1 g1 and
a low activation energy of 33.0 kJ mol1.

Introduction
Effective hydrogen releasing is very important in the appli-
cation of hydrogen energy [1,2]. Among various hydrogen
storage materials, ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) has attrac-
ted a great deal of attentions as an alternative medium
because of its high hydrogen content of 19.6 wt% [3]. Hydrogen
stored in AB can be released through either pyrolysis or
hydrolysis [4]. The catalytic hydrolysis of AB has been studied
using various catalysts [5e8], while precious metals such as Pt
and Pt-based alloys have been proved to outperform the other
non-noble metals [9,10]. However, the high price and limited
abundance of Pt are disadvantageous to its widespread
application.
Therefore, reducing
the
amount
of
Pt
and
improving the activity of Pt-based catalyst is necessary for
practical application.
Pt-based metals have indeed demonstrated favorable
catalytic activities toward AB hydrolysis [11]. Yang and co-
workers prepared the Pt3Ni nanoparticles with the diameters
of about 5e20 nm by a chemical impregnation method [12].
Liu’s group synthesized Pt/Ni hollow spheres by a hydro-
thermal method [13]. Our group showed the preparation of
nest-like
PteNi
submicrometer-size
hollow
spheres
by
a template-replacement synthesis [14] and nanosized PteNi
particles
by
a
reverse-microemulsion
method
[15].
The
hydrolysis rates of the as-prepared PteNi catalysts ranged
from 242.4 to 4785 mL min1 g1. It should be noted that the
previously-reported PteNi catalysts exhibited a relatively

wide size distribution and large particle size or unsatisfactory
dispersions, which limit the rate of hydrogen generation from
AB hydrolysis. The coreeshell nanoarchitectures, which
integrate multifunctionality of individual component into one
single particle, are attractive due to the peculiar physical and
chemical properties [16]. Recently, Xu’s group has studied the
catalytic hydrolysis of AB with Au@Co coreeshell catalyst [17].
It is found that the nanosized coreeshell catalysts with
narrow size distributions and well dispersions display more
attention for their catalytic properties. However, to the best of
our knowledge, few studies have been carried out on the
hydrolysis of AB by using Pt-based coreeshell catalysts.
In this work, Ni coreePt shell nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs,
x ¼ 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) and carbon supported Ni
coreePt
shell
nanoparticles
(Ni1x@Ptx/C
NPs)
(30
wt%
Ni1x@Ptx loading) with small sizes of several nanometers
have been synthesized through a simple redox method
employing an oleic acid as the surfactant. It is noted that
Ni@Pt stands for the coreeshell structure which means that Ni
is the core and Pt is the shell. This notation is according to the
deﬁnition what follows “@” is deposited on the surface of what
precedes it [18]. The properties of the as-prepared coreeshell
nanoparticles were investigated. The results show that the as-
prepared catalysts exhibited high catalytic activities for the
hydrolysis of AB.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalysts preparation
The Ni nanopaticles (Ni NPs), Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs),
Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs), the carbon-supported
Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx
loading) and the carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C NPs)
(30 wt% Pt loading) were prepared using an oleic acid as the
surfactant, while the submicrometer-sized Ni particles (Ni
MPs), Ni1x@Ptx paticles (Ni1x@Ptx MPs) were synthesized
without the addition of oleic acid. The Ni NPs were prepared by
a polyol synthesis route following modiﬁed procedures of
a previous report [19,20]. In the synthesis, 20 mmol of nickel
acetate and 20 mmol of NaOH were mixed and stirred in
deoxygenated ethylene glycol under Ar atmosphere. The
solution was heated to 150 C and then 20 mmol of oleic acid
was added. The mixture was further heated to 200 C and
reﬂuxed for 2 h. For comparison, Ni MPs were also synthesized
without using surfactant under the same conditions. The
synthesized Ni particles in the solution were precipitated by
centrifugation and washed with ethanol. Finally, the Ni parti-
cles were dried under vacuum at 60 C for 12 h.
Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x ¼ 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were
chemically prepared through a redox reaction method. A
certain amount of H2PtCl6 (50 mM isopropanol) was slowly
dripped to the dried Ni NPs at room temperature with
ultrasonic cleaner applied. The reactant molar ratios of Ni to
H2PtCl6 were chosen at 14, 11, 9, 7, and 5 in order to obtain
catalysts with different Pt contents. The molar ratios were
chosen because the early studies showed that when the
reactant molar ratio of Ni to H2PtCl6 was 7, the coreeshell
structure was formed [21]. Pure Pt was prepared when the
reactant ratio added to the reaction of Ni to H2PtCl6 was 1.8,
which far exceeds of the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of
the oxidation for Ni to Ni2þ, so as to make sure H2PtCl6
overdose. As a comparison, Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs with the

(x ¼ 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using
similar process depicted above except that the required
amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the
reduction reaction. Pt/C (30 wt% Pt loading) was also
prepared for comparison as the reactant ratio of Ni to
H2PtCl6 was 1.8.

The present method is different from the preparation of
PtxNi1x alloy reported by our previous paper using a reverse-
microemulsion method [15]. In the preparation of PtxNi1x
alloy, Ni is in the microemulsion without taking out until the
alloy formed. However, in order to synthesize the coreeshell
catalysts, Ni is departed from the solution and dried before the
reaction with H2PtCl6 so as to prevent the amalgamation of Ni
and Pt as reported in the previous paper [22].
2.2.
Catalyst characterization
The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray generator,
Cu Ka radiation), transmission electron microscopy equipped
with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM and EDX,
Philips Tecnai F20, 200 kV), and inductively coupled plasma
emission spectroscopy (ICP). At different stages of the hydro-
lysis reaction, the resulting solutions were ﬁltered, and the
ﬁltrates were collected for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
analysis.
11B NMR spectra were recorded on a MERCU-
RY.VX300 spectrometer with an operating frequency of
128.15 MHz D2O and BF3$(C2H5)2O were used as a lock and an
external reference, respectively.
2.3.
Hydrogen generation measurement
The hydrogen generation rate (r) and the apparent activation
energy (Ea) of the hydrolysis were measured in order to evaluate
theactivityofthecatalysts.Thehydrogengenerationratecanbe
determined from the slopes of the ﬁtting lines that are derived
from the curves of the generated hydrogen volumes (measured

The
volume of the generated H2 (VmL) was measured by the water
displacement method [23]. AB solution and a certain amount of
catalysts were placed in a sealed ﬂask, which was immersed in
a constant temperature bath with controlled temperatures. The
reaction was performed without stirring because the catalysts
will stick to the magnetic stir. A small power ultrasonic cleaner
(CREST 175HT, 220 W, 50/60 Hz) was applied during the reaction
in order to make the catalysts and the reactant uniform. The
outlet exhaust ﬁtted with the ﬂask was placed under an inver-
ted, water-ﬁlled gas burette that was situated in a water-ﬁlled
vessel for recording the evolved H2 volume. The hydrogen
generation rates are tested at different temperatures (measured
below the hydrogen volumes of 60 mL) in order to get the
apparent activation energy [24]. On the basis of the slope of the
arrhenius plot, Ea is calculated according to the equation
lnk ¼ lnA  Ea/RT [25], where the rate constant kðmol min1g1Þ is

Catalyst characterization
Fig. 1 shows the preparation process of Ni1x@Ptx NPs. The ﬁrst
step is the synthesis of Ni particles by a surfactant-mediated
polyol process [26]. The formation of the coreeshell nano-
structures is attained in the second step through the reaction
between Ni NPs and PtCl6
2. In Fig. 1, there are three processes:

the Ni MPs prepared without any oleic acid in the up row, the
Ni NPs obtained using an oleic acid in the middle row, and the
Ni/C NPs achieved using an oleic acid and Vulcan-XC 72 in the
third row. The presence of a lone pair electron in an oleic acid
keeps the formed Ni particles separated. Therefore, the
particle size is regulated and controlled.
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples.
Three characteristic diffraction peaks in curves a, c and f can
be indexed as (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of face
centered cubic (fcc) Ni (JCPDS No. 70e1849). The particles with
deposited Pt in curves b, d, e, g, and h display three new
diffraction peaks which correspond to (111), (200), and (220)
planes of fcc Pt (JCPDS No. 87e647). The patterns of Ni/C NPs
(30 wt% Ni loading), Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67
loading), and Pt/C NPs (30 wt% Pt loading) samples present one
broad peak at 2q ¼ 25, which can be indexed to the vulcan
carbon. The XRD patterns of the catalysts show the peaks of
both Ni and Pt without any noticeable shift, meaning that the
products are not alloys, which are different from the results of
our previous paper [15] owing to the different preparation
methods used. In the previous preparation, the Pt and Ni
atoms can merge with each other well in the in-situ reaction,
while in this work, the Ni NPs were separated from the solu-
tion before the addition of H2PtCl6, and thus the Pt and Ni are
not alloyed but form coreeshell structure [22].
Fig. 3 shows the typical TEM images of the as-prepared
products. It can be seen that the particles of Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs
are in irregular spherical shape with diameters of about
150 nm (Fig. 3a). A higher-magnitude TEM image of a single
particle reveals the coreeshell structure (Fig. 3b). In order to
conﬁrm the Ni@Pt coreeshell architecture, the EDX mapping
of Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs was tested (Fig. 3c). It can be detected that
the green color denoted as Ni element is in the core and the
red color standing for Pt element presents in the shell. The line
scanning analysis (inset of Fig. 3c) extracted data from the
white line in Fig. 3c reveal that the intensity of Pt element is
relatively high on the surface and low in the core of the
particle while the Ni element presents the reverse distribu-
tion. This detection is the typical feature of Ni coreePt shell
architecture. Thus, for Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs, the shell (about
10 nm) is Pt and the core is Ni.
The Ni NPs and Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs prepared with the addition
of oleic acid are uniformly distributed with the sizes ranging
from 2 to 4 nm (Fig. 3d and g). For carbon-supported samples,
the metal particles are well dispersed on the carbon surface
and no obvious agglomeration is observed (Fig. 3j). From the
HRTEM images of an individual nanoparticle (Fig. 3e, h, k), the
clear lattice fringes are obvious. A contrast of core and shell
structure can be observed (Fig. 3h and k), and the dark core is
Ni (1e2 nm) and the gray shell is Pt. From the size distribution
histograms (Fig. 3f and i), the Ni NPs are well distributed with
an average diameter of about 3 nm while Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs
possess the average size of 3.5 nm. The particle sizes increase
by about 0.5 nm after Pt formation, which is in accordance
with previous report that a Pt outer layer would enlarge the
coreeshell structure by less than 0.55 nm [21]. The EDX
mapping was also applied to analyze the Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs.
However, the nanoparticles are too small to be detected, and

the loss energy of Pt is so serious that the regions containing Pt
are difﬁcult to be identiﬁed. The EDX spectra (Fig. 3l and m) of
Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs and Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs catalysts conﬁrm the
presence of Pt and Ni, and the metal loading of the carbon-
supported catalyst is 30 wt% (Fig. 3m). The elemental ratios
detected by EDX agree well with ICP results as summarized in
Table 1, and the ICP data are used as the ratios of the samples.
3.2.
Catalytic activities
We have investigated the catalytic activities of the synthe-
sized catalysts for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of
AB solution. Fig. 4 shows the generated H2 amount as a func-
tion of time with 7 mg of catalysts (not considering the weight
of the support) at 25  0.5 C. The hydrogen generation rates of
the released hydrogen summarized in Table 2. In Fig. 4A, the
Ni NPs exhibit weak catalytic activity during the hydrolysis of
AB, while the release of hydrogen is greatly quickened in the
presence of Ni1x@Ptx NPs. The synthesized Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs
exhibit very low catalytic activities, while the performances
are greatly improved when using oleic acid to downsize the
particle size. In Fig. 4B, the activity of the catalysts is improved
with carbon supporting.
The activities of the catalysts with different Pt contents
vary with the elemental composition. As the Pt content
increases, the hydrogen release rates ﬁrst increase and then
decrease, showing a volcano-shape trend. The Ni0.33@Pt0.67
NPs display the highest catalytic activity, even better than
pure Pt catalyst. The rates of hydrogen generation for
Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs and Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67
loading) NPs are 4892 and 5469 mL min1 g1, respectively.
These
values
are
much
larger
than
that
of
Pt3Ni
(w1388 mL min1 g1) reported by Yao et al. [12] and Pt/Ni
hollow spheres (w242.4 mL min1 g1) reported by Yi et al. [13],
and also exceed our pervious results for submicrometer-size
Ni0.88Pt0.12 hollow spheres (w2333 mL min1 g1) [14] and
Pt0.65Ni0.35 nanoparticles (w4785 mL min1 g1) [15].
Fig. 5A shows the effect of temperature on the hydrogen
generation rates of the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67
loading) NPs. The hydrogen generation rates and rate constant
k at various temperatures (T ) are summarized in Table 3. The
arrhenius plot of lnk versus 1/T for the catalyst is plotted in
Fig. 5B. The slope of the straight line gives apparent activation
energy of 33.0 kJ mol1. In comparison, the apparent activa-
tion energies are usually 39 kJ mol1 for Pt0.65Ni0.35 [15],
30 kJ mol1 for Ni0.88Pt0.12 [14], and 62e70 kJ mol1 for non-
noble metal catalysts [27e29]. Therefore, the present Ea value
is lower than most of the reported data, indicating the
prominent catalytic activity of Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt%
Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading).
Fig. 6 shows the 11B NMR spectra of the solutions taken at
different
stages
of
the
reaction
that
is
catalyzed
by
Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading). The initial AB
solution presents quadruplet peaks centered at d ¼ 23.9 ppm
(Fig. 6a), which coincides with previous results [30,31]. After
reaction for 30 s, the intensities of the quadruplet peaks
become lower (Fig. 6b), indicating the break of BeN and BeH
bonds in AB [14]. After hydrolysis for 1 min, the 11B quadruplet
peaks vanish, and a new peak centered at d ¼ 9.8 ppm appears
(Fig. 6c), illustrating the formation of BeO bond. After the
completion of the reaction, the single
11B peak shifts to
13.3 ppm, and the initial resonance signals centered at
23.9
ppm
disappear
(Fig.
6d),
revealing
the
complete
consumption of AB [32] Accordingly, the hydrolysis reaction of
the AB aqueous solution containing Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs can
simply be described as Eq. (1) [33]:
NH3BH3 þ 2H2O/NHþ
4 þ BO
2 þ 3H2
(1)
The above results indicate that the Ni1x@Ptx NPs outper-
form pure Pt and Ni in catalyzing AB hydrolysis, and
Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs show the best characteristics.

Conclusion
In summary, Ni-core Pt-shell nanostructured Ni1x@Ptx and
Ni1x@Ptx/C (x ¼ 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) (30 wt%
Ni1x@Ptx loading) catalysts with average particle diameter of
about 3 nm have been synthesized via a surfactant-mediated
polyol process. As the catalyst for AB hydrolysis, the prepared
Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) outperform pure
Pt and Ni catalysts and are superior to Ni1x@Ptx particles with
larger size. In the Ni1x@Ptx series, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt%
Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) show the highest catalytic activities,
resulting in a considerable hydrogen release rate exceeding
5000 mL min1 g1 at 25 C as well as high hydrogen genera-
tion efﬁciency and low activation energy.
