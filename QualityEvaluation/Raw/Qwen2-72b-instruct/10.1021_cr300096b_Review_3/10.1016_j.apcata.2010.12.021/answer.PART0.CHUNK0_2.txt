1.The most commonly utilized synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. The reverse micelle synthesis method has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions. This method has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for control over nanoparticle size using reverse micelles as nanoreactors, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles.

1.最常用的双金属催化剂支撑合成方法是初始湿性浸渍，它涉及将金属盐溶解在等于或略小于支撑物孔体积的水体积中。浸渍后，催化剂通常会经历干燥、煅烧和/或加热处理，特别是为了将前体盐还原成金属纳米颗粒。然而，这些处理必须优化，以最小化金属颗粒的烧结和聚结。据报道，反胶束合成方法通过在微乳液中化学还原金属前体来产生均匀的金属纳米颗粒。该方法有可能提高对支撑催化剂活性的理解，特别是考虑到支撑催化剂的活性通常取决于金属纳米颗粒的形状和大小。先前的研究已经证明了使用反胶束作为纳米反应器、树状大分子封装和双嵌段共聚物自组装成胶束来控制纳米颗粒尺寸的潜力。
