1.The most commonly utilized synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. The reverse micelle synthesis method is another approach that has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions. The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis using the reverse micelle method has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles. The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts.

1.最常用的双金属催化剂支撑合成方法是初始湿性浸渍，它涉及将金属盐溶解在等于或略小于支撑物孔体积的水体积中。浸渍后，催化剂通常会经历干燥，煅烧和/或加热处理，特别是将前体盐还原为金属纳米颗粒。然而，这些处理必须优化以最小化金属颗粒的烧结和聚结。反向微乳液合成方法是另一种方法，据报道，它通过在微乳液中化学还原金属前体来产生均匀的金属纳米颗粒。在支撑催化剂合成中使用反向微乳液方法控制纳米颗粒尺寸的能力有可能改善对支撑催化剂活性的理解，特别是考虑到支撑催化剂通常根据金属纳米颗粒的形状和尺寸表现出独特的活性。当前论文的主要目标是使用反向微乳液方法合成尺寸可控的支撑双金属催化剂。
