1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, uses microemulsions to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors. Incipient wetness impregnation can lead to challenges in maintaining narrow particle size distributions, while reverse micelle synthesis offers the potential to control nanoparticle size, which can improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts. Reverse micelle synthesis was used in this study to improve the nanoparticle size uniformity of bimetallic Pt/Ni nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3. The reverse micelle method was employed to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts. Supported Pt/Ni catalysts synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts.

1.用于制备双金属负载催化剂的最常用合成方法包括初始湿性浸渍和反胶束合成。初始湿性浸渍涉及将金属盐溶解在等于或略小于支撑物孔体积的水体积中。另一方面，反胶束合成使用微乳液通过化学还原金属前体来产生均匀的金属纳米颗粒。初始湿性浸渍可能导致维持窄颗粒尺寸分布的挑战，而反胶束合成提供了控制纳米颗粒尺寸的潜力，这可以改善对负载催化剂活性的理解。在本研究中，使用反胶束合成来改善负载在γ-Al2O3上的双金属Pt/Ni纳米颗粒的粒径均匀性。使用反胶束方法来合成尺寸可控的负载双金属催化剂。使用初始湿性浸渍合成的负载Pt/Ni催化剂在低温下对苯、环己烯和1,3-丁二烯的氢化显示出比单金属Pt和Ni催化剂显著更高的活性。
