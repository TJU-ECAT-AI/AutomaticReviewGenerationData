[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support [1] ,[2] ."

[2] "After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination and/or heating treatments, particularly to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. These treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles [1] ,[3] ."

[3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation [4] ,[5] ,[6] ."

[4] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ."

[5] "The internal structure of a microemulsion is dependent upon the relative concentration of water and oil. At low water concentrations in oil, the microemulsions formed will be droplets of water. These droplets of water provide discrete environments of aqueous solution into which a certain amount of water-soluble material can be dissolved."

[6] "Upon mixing two microemulsions, one containing metal precursor and another containing a reducing agent, metal precursor will reduce to metal nanoparticles within the water droplets. This environment provides two major advantages: (1) nanoparticle growth is restricted by the presence of surfactants, thus promoting uniform particle sizes,[9] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] and (2) nanoparticle size is dependent on the size of the water droplets, which can be varied by changing the molar ratio of water to surfactant (known as the ω parameter) [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ."

[7] "The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles [6] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ."

[8] "Previous research has demonstrated the potential for control over nanoparticle size using reverse micelles as nanoreactors [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , dendrimer encapsulation [25] ,[26] , and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles [27] ,[28] ."

[9] "The main objective of the current paper is to employ the reverse micelle method to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts."

[10] "One of the model bimetallic systems that has been previously well-studied is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. Depending on experimental conditions, a monolayer of Ni atoms can either reside on the surface to produce a NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface, or diffuse into the subsurface to form a Pt-terminated PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure. These two surfaces exhibit properties that differ from each other and from their monometallic surfaces [29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] ."

[11] "Due to the decreased adsorbate binding energy of atomic hydrogen and alkenes, novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways have been identified on the Pt-terminated bimetallic model surfaces [29] ,[33] ,[34] ."

[12] "On the other hand, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface configuration binds adsorbates more strongly and is predicted to be beneficial to produce H2 from oxygenates [31] and ammonia [35] ."

[13] "The trends of enhanced hydrogenation activity on the Pt-terminated bimetallic model surfaces have been recently extended to oxide-supported Pt/Ni catalysts synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation. These studies showed that supported Pt/Ni catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity for low-temperature hydrogenation of benzene, cyclohexene, and 1,3-butadiene as compared to the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts [4] ,[36] ."

[14] "In the current paper we utilize reverse micelle synthesis to obtain uniform, supported, reduced Ni nanoparticles and use incipient wetness impregnation to deposit Pt to produce supported core-shell Pt/Ni nanoparticles. Co-impregnation of Pt/Ni catalyst in a single microemulsion was also performed to provide a comparison with the step-impregnation technique."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. After impregnation, catalysts often undergo drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments to reduce the precursor salts into metal nanoparticles. However, these treatments must be optimized to minimize sintering and agglomeration of the metal particles. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions. This method provides two major advantages: (1) nanoparticle growth is restricted by the presence of surfactants, thus promoting uniform particle sizes, and (2) nanoparticle size is dependent on the size of the water droplets, which can be varied by changing the molar ratio of water to surfactant. The ability to control nanoparticle size during supported catalyst synthesis has the potential to improve the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, particularly given that supported catalysts often exhibit unique activity depending on the shape and size of metal nanoparticles.

1.用于支撑双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括初始湿性浸渍和反胶束合成。初始湿性浸渍涉及将金属盐溶解在等于或略小于支撑物孔体积的水体积中。浸渍后，催化剂通常会经过干燥、煅烧和/或加热处理，以将前体盐还原为金属纳米颗粒。然而，这些处理必须进行优化，以最小化金属颗粒的烧结和聚结。另一方面，反胶束合成已被报道通过在微乳液中化学还原金属前体来产生均匀的金属纳米颗粒。这种方法提供了两个主要优势：(1)由于表面活性剂的存在，纳米颗粒的生长受到限制，从而促进均匀的颗粒尺寸，(2)纳米颗粒的尺寸取决于水滴的大小，这可以通过改变水与表面活性剂的摩尔比来改变。在支撑催化剂合成过程中控制纳米颗粒尺寸的能力有可能提高对支撑催化剂活性的理解，特别是考虑到支撑催化剂的活性通常取决于金属纳米颗粒的形状和尺寸。
