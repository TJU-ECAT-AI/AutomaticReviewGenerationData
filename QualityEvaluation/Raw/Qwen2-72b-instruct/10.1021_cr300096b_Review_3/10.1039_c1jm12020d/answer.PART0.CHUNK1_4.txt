[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
[2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
[4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
[5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
[6] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
[7] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
[8] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
[9] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
[10] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
[11] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
[12] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
[13] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
[14] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[15] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
[16] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
[17] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
[18] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."

1.The two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is a common synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts, but it is somewhat complicated. A one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has been developed recently, which is simpler and more efficient. This method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used as a reducing agent to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through a one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes. The one-step synthetic method is achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to NH3BH3 simultaneously. Au NPs are formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species. The pre-formed Au NPs serve as in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduce Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells. The basic concept of this one-step synthesis is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts, where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential. This method is general and can be used to prepare non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs as well. Another one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures has been presented, in which octadecylamine (ODA) is used as a suitable reducing agent. In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on a specific reduction mechanism. Most recently, bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, has been used as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature. Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT can preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs serve as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs. The morphology of the Pd shell can be adjusted by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio. One-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape has also been reported, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) is used as both reductant and stabilizer. Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent.

1.两步还原/外延生长法是制备双金属催化剂的常用合成方法，但有些复杂。最近开发了一种一步法路线，用于制备双金属核壳纳米颗粒，这种方法更简单、更高效。该方法涉及使用适合具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子的还原剂。例如，NH3BH3可用作还原剂，通过一步种子生长路线在室温下在大气气氛中几分钟内制备可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳纳米颗粒。一步合成方法是通过同时将Au3+和Co2+前体暴露于NH3BH3来实现的。首先，NH3BH3还原Au3+形成Au纳米颗粒，然后Au纳米颗粒作为水解脱氢NH3BH3以提供活性H物种的催化剂。预形成的Au纳米颗粒作为原位种子，产生的活性H物种还原Co2+以连续生长外Co壳。这种一步合成的基本概念是利用两种金属盐的不同还原电位，其中NH3BH3作为温和的还原剂是必不可少的。该方法具有普遍性，也可用于制备非贵金属基双金属核壳纳米颗粒。另一种一锅湿化学路线用于合成Au@Co核壳纳米晶体和AuNi纺锤状纳米结构，其中使用辛基胺(ODA)作为合适的还原剂。在ODA溶剂中，M2+(M=Co，Ni)不能被还原，而Au3+和M2+可以基于特定的还原机制共还原。最近，黄柏单宁(BT)，一种天然植物多酚，已被用作一步法合成Au@Pd核壳纳米颗粒在水溶液中室温下的还原剂。由于其温和和逐步的还原能力，BT可以优先还原Au3+至Au纳米颗粒，当与Au3+/Pd2+混合物接触时，随后形成的Au纳米颗粒作为原位种子用于Pd壳的生长，从而形成Au@Pd纳米颗粒。通过改变Pd2+/Au3+摩尔比可以调整Pd壳的形态。一锅水溶液合成具有明确定义的八面体形状的双金属Au@Pd核壳纳米颗粒也已报道，其中十六烷基三甲基氯化铵(CTAC)用作还原剂和稳定剂。类似地，使用抗坏血酸作为特殊还原剂合成了三层Au@Pd@Pt核壳纳米颗粒。
