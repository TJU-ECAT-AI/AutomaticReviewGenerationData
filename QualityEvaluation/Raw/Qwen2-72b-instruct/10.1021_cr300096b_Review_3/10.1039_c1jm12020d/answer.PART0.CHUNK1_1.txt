[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
[2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
[4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells."
[5] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
[6] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
[7] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[8] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
[9] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method and the one-step route. The two-step method is general but complicated, while the one-step route is simpler and more efficient. The one-step method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au NPs, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form Co shells. This method has been applied to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs and non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs. Other reducing agents, such as octadecylamine (ODA), bayberry tannin (BT), and ascorbic acid, have also been used in one-step synthesis methods for bimetallic coreshell NPs. The choice of reducing agent is crucial for the success of the synthesis. The one-step route has the potential advantages of being simpler, more efficient, and more general than the two-step method. It can be applied to synthesize various bimetallic coreshell NPs with different compositions and morphologies.

1.用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括两步还原/外延生长法和一步法。两步法虽然通用，但较为复杂，而一步法则更简单、更高效。一步法涉及使用适合具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子的还原剂。例如，NH3BH3可以用来还原Au3+形成Au NPs，然后作为催化剂还原Co2+形成Co壳层。该方法已被用于制备可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳NPs和非贵金属基双金属核壳NPs。其他还原剂，如十八烷基胺（ODA）、五倍子鞣质（BT）和抗坏血酸，也已在一步合成方法中用于双金属核壳NPs。还原剂的选择对于合成的成功至关重要。一步法具有比两步法更简单、更高效、更通用的潜在优势。它可以应用于合成具有不同组成和形态的各种双金属核壳NPs。
