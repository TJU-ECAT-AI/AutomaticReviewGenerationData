[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include alloying and coreshell structure preparation. Alloying involves impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent, where two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. This method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but is adapted for bimetallic NPs. The coreshell structure preparation typically involves a successive two-step reduction, where the shell metal is deposited on pre-formed core metal NPs. This method is effective for creating coreshell bimetallic NPs, but it requires careful deposition to ensure the pre-formed metal NPs are chemically surrounded by the deposited element. Both methods have their potential advantages and applications in catalyst production, with alloying offering distinct binding properties and coreshell structure preparation allowing for the tuning of properties by controlling chemical composition and relative sizes of the core and shell.

1.用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括合金化和核心壳结构制备。合金化涉及使用相对强还原剂的浸渍/共还原，其中两个金属前体为双金属NPs共引入。此方法用于单金属NPs的合成，但适应于双金属NPs。核心壳结构制备通常涉及连续的两步还原，其中壳金属沉积在预形成的核金属NPs上。此方法对于创建双金属核心壳NPs是有效的，但需要仔细沉积以确保预形成的金属NPs被沉积元素化学包围。这两种方法在催化剂生产中都有其潜在的优势和应用，合金化提供独特的结合性质，而核心壳结构制备允许通过控制化学组成和核心和壳的相对大小来调整性质。
