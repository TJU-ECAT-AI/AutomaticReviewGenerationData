1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does describe various methods such as one-step reduction, galvanic replacement, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and others. These methods have their own advantages and applications, but the overall efficacy in catalyst production depends on the specific catalytic reaction and the desired properties of the catalyst.
