[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
[2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
[4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
[5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
[6] "It is worthy to note here that use of a strong reducing agent (for example, NaBH4) will result in the formation of alloy NPs whereas use of a very weak reducing agent (for example, alcohol) cannot yield NPs or give only Au NPs because Co2+ cannot be reduced."
[7] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
[8] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
[9] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
[10] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
[11] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
[12] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
[13] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
[14] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
[15] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[16] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
[17] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
[18] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
[19] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."

1.The two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is a common method for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts, but it is somewhat complicated. A one-step method for synthesizing bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles has been developed recently, which is simpler and more efficient. This method involves using a suitable reducing agent that can selectively reduce metal cations with different reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au nanoparticles, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form a Co shell around the Au core. This method takes advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts and the moderate reducing power of NH3BH3. The use of a strong reducing agent like NaBH4 can result in the formation of alloy nanoparticles, while a very weak reducing agent like alcohol cannot yield nanoparticles or can only yield Au nanoparticles. This method has been used to synthesize magnetically recyclable Au@Co core-shell nanoparticles and has also been applied to non-noble metal-based bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles. Another one-pot wet chemical route has been developed using octadecylamine (ODA) as a reducing agent, which can co-reduce Au3+ and M2+ (M = Co, Ni) to form Au@Co or AuNi core-shell nanostructures. The reduction mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from ODA to Au3+, followed by the adsorption of M2+ on the surface of Au and the sharing of the electron cloud. This method has also been used to synthesize Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles using bayberry tannin (BT) as a reducing agent. The morphology of the Pd shell can be adjusted by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio. One-step aqueous synthesis of Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles with a well-defined octahedral shape has also been reported using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both a reductant and stabilizer. Triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticles have been synthesized using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent.

1.两步还原/外延生长法是合成负载型双金属催化剂的常用方法，但有些复杂。最近开发了一种一步法制备双金属核壳纳米粒子，更简单、更高效。该方法涉及使用合适的还原剂，能够选择性地还原具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子。例如，NH3BH3可以用来还原Au3+形成Au纳米粒子，然后作为催化剂还原Co2+在Au核周围形成Co壳。该方法利用了两种金属盐的不同还原电位和NH3BH3的适度还原能力。使用NaBH4等强还原剂会导致合金纳米粒子的形成，而使用酒精等弱还原剂则无法产生纳米粒子或只能产生Au纳米粒子。该方法已被用于合成可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳纳米粒子，并已应用于非贵金属基双金属核壳纳米粒子。还开发了一种使用辛基胺（ODA）作为还原剂的一锅湿化学路线，可以共还原Au3+和M2+（M = Co，Ni）形成Au@Co或AuNi核壳纳米结构。还原机制涉及从ODA向Au3+转移电子，随后M2+吸附在Au表面并共享电子云。该方法还被用于使用bayberry单宁（BT）作为还原剂合成Au@Pd核壳纳米粒子。通过改变Pd2+/Au3+摩尔比可以调整Pd壳的形态。还报道了一步水相合成具有明确定义的八面体形状的Au@Pd核壳纳米粒子，使用十六烷基三甲基氯化铵（CTAC）作为还原剂和稳定剂。使用抗坏血酸作为特殊还原剂合成了三层Au@Pd@Pt核壳纳米粒子。
