[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

1.用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括使用相对强还原剂的浸渍/共还原法来制备双金属合金NPs，以及分别对核心和壳NPs进行连续两步还原，以制备双金属核壳NPs。浸渍/共还原方法用于单金属NPs的合成，但为双金属NPs共引入两种金属前体。连续两步还原方法涉及将壳金属沉积在预形成的核金属NPs上，这是有效的，但要求预形成的金属NPs被沉积的元素化学包围。
