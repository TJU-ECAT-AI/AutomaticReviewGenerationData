1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does describe various methods such as the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method, one-step reduction methods, galvanic replacement, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and others. Each method has its own advantages and applications. For instance, the one-step reduction method is simpler and faster than the two-step method, while galvanic replacement is effective for creating hollow interiors in bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles. The choice of method depends on the desired structure, composition, and properties of the catalyst.

1.文献没有直接比较用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法。但是，它确实描述了各种方法，例如两步还原/外延生长方法、一步还原方法、电置换、表面相分离、物理混合等。每种方法都有其自身的优势和应用。例如，一步还原法比两步法更简单、更快，而电置换对于在双金属核壳纳米粒子中形成空腔是有效的。方法的选择取决于催化剂所需的结构、组成和性质。
