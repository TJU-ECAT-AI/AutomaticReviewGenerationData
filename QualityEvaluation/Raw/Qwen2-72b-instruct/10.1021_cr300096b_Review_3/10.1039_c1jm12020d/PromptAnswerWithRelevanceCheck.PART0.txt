[1] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."
[2] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[3] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
[4] "The pre-formed Au NPs served as the in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduced Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells (Scheme 2)."
[5] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
[6] "It is worthy to note here that use of a strong reducing agent (for example, NaBH4) will result in the formation of alloy NPs whereas use of a very weak reducing agent (for example, alcohol) cannot yield NPs or give only Au NPs because Co2+ cannot be reduced."
[7] "Following a similar strategy, non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs have also been prepared by using NH3BH3 as reducing agent, demonstrating the generality of this method."
[8] "Wang and Li have also presented a one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures, in which a suitable reducing agent, octadecylamine (ODA), is crucial for their success."
[9] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism: the Au3+ can obtain electrons from ODA and be reduced to Au (step I)."
[10] "Once the Au forms, it is surrounded by an electron cloud offered by free electrons of other Au atoms."
[11] "M2+ cannot be directly reduced by either ODA or Au, but it can be adsorbed on the surface of Au and share a small portion of the electron cloud through its empty orbital (step II)."
[12] "This causes the spherical electron cloud distribution surrounding Au to become an elliptical distribution."
[13] "The shift in the electron cloud leads to a partial positive charge on the Au surface, which is immediately neutralized by electrons offered by ODA."
[14] "The continual supply of electrons from ODA to Au makes the shift in the electron cloud from Au to M occur continuously until M2+ is reduced completely."
[15] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[16] "Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT was able to preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs served as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs."
[17] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."
[18] "Han and coworkers have also reported one-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both reductant and stabilizer is very critical and cannot be substituted by ascorbic acid or CTAB."
[19] "Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent, which we will discuss in detail in Section 4."

1.The two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is a common method for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts, but it is somewhat complicated. A one-step method for synthesizing bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles has been developed recently, which is simpler and more efficient. This method involves using a suitable reducing agent that can selectively reduce metal cations with different reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used to reduce Au3+ to form Au nanoparticles, which then act as a catalyst for the reduction of Co2+ to form a Co shell around the Au core. This method takes advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts and the moderate reducing power of NH3BH3. The use of a strong reducing agent like NaBH4 can result in the formation of alloy nanoparticles, while a very weak reducing agent like alcohol cannot yield nanoparticles or can only yield Au nanoparticles. This method has been used to synthesize magnetically recyclable Au@Co core-shell nanoparticles and has also been applied to non-noble metal-based bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles. Another one-pot wet chemical route has been developed using octadecylamine (ODA) as a reducing agent, which can co-reduce Au3+ and M2+ (M = Co, Ni) to form Au@Co or AuNi core-shell nanostructures. The reduction mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from ODA to Au3+, followed by the adsorption of M2+ on the surface of Au and the sharing of the electron cloud. This method has also been used to synthesize Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles using bayberry tannin (BT) as a reducing agent. The morphology of the Pd shell can be adjusted by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio. One-step aqueous synthesis of Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles with a well-defined octahedral shape has also been reported using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as both a reductant and stabilizer. Triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt core-shell nanoparticles have been synthesized using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent.

1.两步还原/外延生长法是合成负载型双金属催化剂的常用方法，但有些复杂。最近开发了一种一步法制备双金属核壳纳米粒子，更简单、更高效。该方法涉及使用合适的还原剂，能够选择性地还原具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子。例如，NH3BH3可以用来还原Au3+形成Au纳米粒子，然后作为催化剂还原Co2+在Au核周围形成Co壳。该方法利用了两种金属盐的不同还原电位和NH3BH3的适度还原能力。使用NaBH4等强还原剂会导致合金纳米粒子的形成，而使用酒精等弱还原剂则无法产生纳米粒子或只能产生Au纳米粒子。该方法已被用于合成可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳纳米粒子，并已应用于非贵金属基双金属核壳纳米粒子。还开发了一种使用辛基胺（ODA）作为还原剂的一锅湿化学路线，可以共还原Au3+和M2+（M = Co，Ni）形成Au@Co或AuNi核壳纳米结构。还原机制涉及从ODA向Au3+转移电子，随后M2+吸附在Au表面并共享电子云。该方法还被用于使用bayberry单宁（BT）作为还原剂合成Au@Pd核壳纳米粒子。通过改变Pd2+/Au3+摩尔比可以调整Pd壳的形态。还报道了一步水相合成具有明确定义的八面体形状的Au@Pd核壳纳米粒子，使用十六烷基三甲基氯化铵（CTAC）作为还原剂和稳定剂。使用抗坏血酸作为特殊还原剂合成了三层Au@Pd@Pt核壳纳米粒子。

[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include alloying and coreshell structure preparation. Alloying involves impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent, where two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. This method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but is adapted for bimetallic NPs. The coreshell structure preparation typically involves a successive two-step reduction, where the shell metal is deposited on pre-formed core metal NPs. This method is effective for creating coreshell bimetallic NPs, but it requires careful deposition to ensure the pre-formed metal NPs are chemically surrounded by the deposited element. Both methods have their potential advantages and applications in catalyst production, with alloying offering distinct binding properties and coreshell structure preparation allowing for the tuning of properties by controlling chemical composition and relative sizes of the core and shell.

A one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has been developed recently, which is simpler and more efficient. This method involves using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with differential reduction potentials. For example, NH3BH3 can be used as a reducing agent to fabricate magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through a one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes. The one-step synthetic method is achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to NH3BH3 simultaneously. Au NPs are formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species. The pre-formed Au NPs serve as in situ seeds and the produced active H species reduce Co2+ for the successive growth of outer Co shells. The basic concept of this one-step synthesis is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts, where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential. This method is general and can be used to prepare non-noble metal-based bimetallic coreshell NPs as well. Another one-pot wet chemical route to the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell nanocrystals and AuNi spindly nanostructures has been presented, in which octadecylamine (ODA) is used as a suitable reducing agent. In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on a specific reduction mechanism. Most recently, bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, has been used as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature. Due to its mild and stepwise reduction ability, BT can preferentially reduce Au3+ to Au NPs when placed in contact with an Au3+/Pd2+ mixture, and subsequently, the formed Au NPs serve as in situ seeds for the growth of a Pd shell, resulting in the formation of Au@Pd NPs. The morphology of the Pd shell can be adjusted by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio. One-step aqueous synthesis of bimetallic Au@Pd coreshell NPs with a well-defined octahedral shape has also been reported, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) is used as both reductant and stabilizer. Similarly, triple-layered Au@Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been synthesized by using ascorbic acid as a special reducing agent.

1.两步还原/外延生长法是制备双金属催化剂的常用合成方法，但有些复杂。最近开发了一种一步法路线，用于制备双金属核壳纳米颗粒，这种方法更简单、更高效。该方法涉及使用适合具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子的还原剂。例如，NH3BH3可用作还原剂，通过一步种子生长路线在室温下在大气气氛中几分钟内制备可磁性回收的Au@Co核壳纳米颗粒。一步合成方法是通过同时将Au3+和Co2+前体暴露于NH3BH3来实现的。首先，NH3BH3还原Au3+形成Au纳米颗粒，然后Au纳米颗粒作为水解脱氢NH3BH3以提供活性H物种的催化剂。预形成的Au纳米颗粒作为原位种子，产生的活性H物种还原Co2+以连续生长外Co壳。这种一步合成的基本概念是利用两种金属盐的不同还原电位，其中NH3BH3作为温和的还原剂是必不可少的。该方法具有普遍性，也可用于制备非贵金属基双金属核壳纳米颗粒。另一种一锅湿化学路线用于合成Au@Co核壳纳米晶体和AuNi纺锤状纳米结构，其中使用辛基胺(ODA)作为合适的还原剂。在ODA溶剂中，M2+(M=Co，Ni)不能被还原，而Au3+和M2+可以基于特定的还原机制共还原。最近，黄柏单宁(BT)，一种天然植物多酚，已被用作一步法合成Au@Pd核壳纳米颗粒在水溶液中室温下的还原剂。由于其温和和逐步的还原能力，BT可以优先还原Au3+至Au纳米颗粒，当与Au3+/Pd2+混合物接触时，随后形成的Au纳米颗粒作为原位种子用于Pd壳的生长，从而形成Au@Pd纳米颗粒。通过改变Pd2+/Au3+摩尔比可以调整Pd壳的形态。一锅水溶液合成具有明确定义的八面体形状的双金属Au@Pd核壳纳米颗粒也已报道，其中十六烷基三甲基氯化铵(CTAC)用作还原剂和稳定剂。类似地，使用抗坏血酸作为特殊还原剂合成了三层Au@Pd@Pt核壳纳米颗粒。

[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit. Usually, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."
[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs, and the successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs respectively to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The impregnation/co-reduction method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs. The successive two-step reduction method involves the deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs, which is effective but requires the pre-formed metal NPs to be chemically surrounded by the deposited element. These methods have potential advantages in tuning the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, stabilizing the transition state on the alloy catalysts, and controlling the chemical composition and the relative sizes of the core and shell.

1.用于制备双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法包括使用相对强还原剂的浸渍/共还原法来制备双金属合金NPs，以及分别对核心和壳NPs进行连续两步还原以制备双金属壳NPs。浸渍/共还原方法用于单金属NPs的合成，但双金属NPs时会引入两种金属前体。连续两步还原方法涉及在预形成的金属NPs上沉积壳金属，这是有效的，但需要预形成的金属NPs被沉积元素化学包围。这些方法在调节催化剂表面与反应物之间的结合，稳定合金催化剂上的过渡态，以及控制核心和壳的化学组成和相对大小方面具有潜在优势。
