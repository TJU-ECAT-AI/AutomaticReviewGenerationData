[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] ."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive impregnation and co-impregnation methods. These methods have been widely used in industrial processes due to the beneficial modifications in activity, selectivity, and stability that can be achieved by including additional metals. However, these traditional methodologies often lack precise control over metal placement, leading to catalysts that contain both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions.
