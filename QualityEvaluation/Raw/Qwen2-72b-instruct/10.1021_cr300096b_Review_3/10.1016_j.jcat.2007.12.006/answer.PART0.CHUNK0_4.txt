[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] . These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] . However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] . This complex mixture of particles results in poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes any definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition virtually impossible."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation methods. These methods have been widely used in industrial processes due to the beneficial modifications in activity, selectivity, and stability that can be achieved by including additional metals. However, these traditional methodologies often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. This complex mixture of particles leads to poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes it virtually impossible to establish definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition.

1.用于支撑双金属催化剂的最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍和共浸渍方法。由于在工业过程中通过添加额外的金属可以实现有益的活性、选择性和稳定性修改，这些方法已被广泛使用。然而，这些传统的方法学通常对金属放置的控制不足，导致催化剂同时含有孤立的单金属颗粒和组成不同的双金属颗粒。这种复杂的颗粒混合物导致对最终催化剂性能的控制不佳，几乎不可能在催化剂性能、催化剂表征和催化剂组成之间建立明确的关联。
