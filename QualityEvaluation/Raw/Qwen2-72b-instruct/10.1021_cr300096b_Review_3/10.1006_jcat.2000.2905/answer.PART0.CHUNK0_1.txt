[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, im- pregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."

[2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dis- persed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (partic- ularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step, usually reduction. Another approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors, particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds, onto the support and thermally remove the ligands. The former method is widely used but may result in issues like chromatographic separation of precursor ions and excessive sintering. The latter method can produce highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts.

1.制备负载型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法涉及将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到载体上,然后进行活化步骤,通常是还原。另一种方法是将配体稳定的双金属分子前体,特别是无机和有机金属簇合物,吸附到载体上,然后热去除配体。前者方法虽然广泛使用,但可能导致前体离子的色谱分离和过度烧结等问题。后者方法可以产生高度分散的负载型金属颗粒催化剂。
