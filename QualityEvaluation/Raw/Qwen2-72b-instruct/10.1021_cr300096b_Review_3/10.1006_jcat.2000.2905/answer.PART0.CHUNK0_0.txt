[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."

[2] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

1.The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step, usually reduction. Another approach is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and thermally remove the ligands to prepare highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts.

1.制备负载型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法涉及将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到支撑体上，然后进行活化步骤，通常是还原。另一种方法是将配体稳定的双金属分子前体吸附到支撑体上，然后热去除配体，以制备高度分散的负载金属颗粒催化剂。
