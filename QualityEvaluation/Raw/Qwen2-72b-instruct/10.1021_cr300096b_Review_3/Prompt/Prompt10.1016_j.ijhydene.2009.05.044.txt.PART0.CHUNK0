Introduction The hydrogen economy is seen as a possible solution to the various economical, environmental and security woes asso- ciated with the current fossil fuel-based economy [15].
Hydrogen is, however, rarely found in its elemental form on Earth. As such, a hydrogen economy would only be realisable with sustainable and cost-effective large-scale H2 production technologies. Besides the conventional steam reforming of natural gas, various H2 production methods are currently being explored, including the partial oxidation of methane [6],gasification of coal [7],electrolysis or thermochemical decomposition of water [8], microbial H2 metabolism [9,10],and the reforming of ethanol [4,1118]. In particular, there are several advantages of using this last production method.
Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel.

uptake and release depends on various factors, including infrastructure, the type of crops and processing methods [1921]. Ethanol also has a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily transported, and is relatively non-toxic.
The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low tempera- tures and have notoriously low CO-tolerance [22]. The advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can also be extracted from the steam.

(1) Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipi- tation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently,incipient wetness impregnation [2427].
Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts,and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]. However, in spite of its demonstrated advan- tages, to the best of our knowledge, no cluster-derived ethanol steam reforming catalysts have been reported prior to our recent communication [11]. Therein, the catalytic performance of a monometallic Ru cluster-derived catalyst and a bimetallic RuPt cluster-derived catalyst outperformed all their salt- derivedcounterparts, as well as a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst.
In the previous report, the two cluster-derived catalysts were prepared from the cluster anions [HRu3(CO)11] and [Ru5PtC(CO)15]2 [11]. In this work, an additional cluster- derived catalyst, also supported on g-Al2O3, was prepared from the neutral cluster Ru3(CO)12. These cluster precursors were chosen so that differences between neutral and charged cluster precursors (Ru(2.5)[c0] versus Ru(2.5)[c]), as well as the bimetallic effects of platinum (Ru(2.5)[c], Ru(2.5)[c0] versus Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]), could be studied. The differences between the three cluster-derived catalysts vis-a -vis their salt-derived counterparts were studied to allow for better rationalisation of future catalyst designs. To probe such differences, various techniques,including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature- programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed H2 desorption (H2-TPD) and ethanol temperature-programmed desorption (EtOH-TPD) have been employed. The results of these studies will be discussed herein.

Experimental
2.1.
Precursor and catalyst preparation Ru3(CO)12 (Oxkem) was purified by recrystallization according to the suppliers instructions before use. Gases and other reagent grade chemicals were obtained from various commercial sources and used without further purification.
Distilled water was used to prepare aqueous solutions. The cluster compounds [Et4N][HRu3(CO)11] [36] and [PPh4]2[Ru5PtC(CO)15] [37] were synthesized following litera- ture methods. Syntheses and manipulations of organome- tallic clusters were carried out under an argon atmosphere,using standard Schlenk techniques. Manipulations of inor- ganic salts were carried out on the open bench, without precautions to exclude oxygen or moisture.
Supported cluster-derived catalysts of nominal 2.5 wt.% Ru loadings were prepared as previously described [11,3335].
Briefly, the cluster precursor and the g-Al2O3 (Merck) support were slurred in a two-solvent system (diethyl ether/dichloro- methane, or diethyl ether/ethanol). The system was chosen such that the cluster was insoluble in the first bulk solvent but soluble in the second solvent, of which only a few drops were added. The slurry was stirred for 2 d at room temperature to load the cluster onto the support. The mixture was then filtered under Ar. The residue was washed with a small amount of the first solvent, which was then removed as before. Finally, the residue was heated at 195 C under vacuum for 6 h to yield the catalyst as a greyish powder. Catalysts were prepared from Ru3(CO)12, [Et4N][HRu3(CO)11] and [PPh4]2[Ru5PtC(CO)15], and will hereafter be referred to as Ru(2.5)[c0], Ru(2.5)[c], and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c], respectively, where [c0] refers to a neutral cluster precursor and [c] an anionic cluster precursor.
Salt-derived Ru/Pt catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method, with aqueous solu- tions of RuCl3.nH2O and/or H2PtCl6.nH2O and g-Al2O3 as support. Impregnation refers to the process by which the solid support is contacted with a certain volume of solution con- taining the precursor of the active catalyst element (the inorganic salts in this case). If the solution volume equals, or is smaller than, the pore volume of the support, then this method is known as incipient wetness [38]. For simplicity,salt-derived impregnation catalysts will be denoted as Ru(x)Pt( y)[i], where x and y are the nominal weight percent- ages of Ru and Pt, respectively. A 5 wt.% Ru/Al2O3 commercial catalyst (Strem Chemicals) was also tested. This catalyst is hereafter referred to as Ru(5)[com].
Finally, a 1% Rh catalyst was prepared using the incipient wetnessimpregnationmethodfromaRhCl3.nH2Osolution,while a ZnO-supported Co catalyst of nominal 2.5 wt.% Co was prepared in accordance to the reported procedure [28]. These two catalysts, hereafter referred to as Rh(1) and Co(2.5), are consid- ered to be among the best performing ethanol steam reforming catalysts [12,24,25] and were prepared for comparison.
2.2.
Catalyst characterisation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature- programmed desorption of
H2
(H2-TPD)
studies were performed using a TPDRO 1100 series equipment (Thermo- electron). For TPR study, the catalyst was first heated at 500 C under Ar gas flow for 30 min to remove any absorbed species such as CO2 or H2O. TPR was then carried out from room temperature to 500 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min in the gas flow of 5% H2/Ar. For H2-TPD study, the catalyst was reduced at 500 C (for Ru/Pt catalysts)/300 C (for Rh catalyst) for 2 h, then purged with Argas whilecooling downto 30 C.At 30 C,H2 was i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 3 4 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 5 6 9 1  5 7 0 3 5692 introduced again to allow adsorption for 1 h. After that, the sample was purged by Ar at 30 C for another 1 h. The H2-TPD was performed under the Ar flow with a heating rate of 20 C/ min. The amount of H2 consumed/desorbed was measured as a function of temperature by means of a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD).
Dispersion of the metallic component,expressed in terms of H/Metal ratio, was obtained assuming that each metal atom chemisorbs one hydrogen atom.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done on a FEI Tecnai G2 microscope. All the samples were pre-reduced in pure H2 at 800 C to get well crystalline images. X-ray photo- electron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using a Mg Ka radiation source. Data was processed using the XPS Peak 4.1 software [31,39], with respect to the neutral carbon C1s peak set at 284.5 eV.
Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption (EtOH-TPD) studies were performed with pre-reduced 20 mg samples in a micro-quartz tube reactor system. The sample was first reduced at 800 C under H2 flow for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature in Ar flow, the carrier gas was then bubbled through ethanol at 30 C to allow for the adsorption of ethanol on the catalyst. The bubbling was then stopped after 15 min,and Ar was used to purge the system of any free ethanol by passing it through the system for about an hour. The furnace temperature was then increased to 600 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The products were monitored using a Hiden Analytical HPR-20 mass spectrometer system. Signals at m/e ratios of 44, 43, 40, 32, 31, 28, 26, 15 and 2 were assigned as CO2, CH3CHO, Ar, O2, CH3CH2OH, CO, C2H4, CH4 and H2, respectively.
2.3.
Catalyst evaluation Catalytic runs were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed stainless steel micro-reactor (I.D. 4 mm) packed with 50 mg or 100 mg samples. All catalysts,except Co(2.5), were first reduced in situ under hydrogen (40 ml/min) for 1 h at 800 C prior to each run. An ethanol/ water solution (1/3, v/v) was then introduced into a vaporiser (150 C), by means of a HPLC pump (Shimadzu LC-20AT), at a rate of 0.025 ml/min. N2 (300 ml/min) was used to carry the vaporised mixture to the reactor. The reaction products were measured by on-line gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC- 2010 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionising detector (FID). The TCD was used for detec- tion of H2, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, CO, CO2 and N2; while the FID was used for detection of CH3CHO, C2H5OH and other products. N2 was used as the internal standard.
The ethanol conversion (XEtOH), and the selectivities of C- containing products (SC) of the various samples were calcu- lated according to Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively: XEtOH  molEtOHin  molEtOHout molEtOHin 100% (2) SC  molC
P
n i pi 100% (3) where Pi represents the molar yield of a detected C-containing product. Calculations were done based on detected carbon numbers only, on the assumption that no coke was formed.
This assumption is reasonable as the relatively high steam-to- ethanol molar ratio used (w10:1) should minimise coke formation [12,40]. Hydrogen yield YH2 was evaluated in terms of the number of moles of H2 produced per mole of injected ethanol, as given in Eq. (4):

The GHSV cited in this study was calculated based on the total flow rate of the feed mixture in gas phase.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Preparation of cluster-derived catalysts A cluster is defined herein as a discrete unit with at least three metal atoms, and in which metal-metal bonds are present [41]. Organometallic clusters can be simplistically viewed as metallic cores that are wrapped within a layer of ligands. In the preparation of cluster-derived catalysts, clus- ters of the desired metallic component(s) were first loaded onto the support material. With the Ru3(CO)12 cluster, a slight colouration of the solvent was observed during filtering and washing. This indicated a slight leaching of the cluster precursor from the support, which had not been observed previously with the other two clusters [HRu3(CO)11] and [Ru5PtC(CO)15]2. This was, however, not very surprising, as the use of charged cluster precursors should limit cluster lost due to stronger cluster-support electrostatic interactions.
Upon solvent removal, a coloured powder was obtained,indicating the presence of adsorbed organometallic cluster on the supports surface. This was followed by gentle thermolysis in vacuo, yielding a greyish powder. The heat treatment served to remove the CO ligands, leaving behind the naked metallic cores as supported nanoparticles (see Fig. 1). Indeed, the carbonyl regions of the IR spectra (nujol mull) of such catalysts became featureless.
Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]. During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sin- tering was kept to a minimum. Indeed, subsequent TEM, TPR and H2-TPD studies support this hypothesis (vide infra).
3.2.
Characterisation of catalysts Temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR)
studies were carried out to study the effects of the preparation method on the catalysts reducibility and the metal/support interactions. i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 3 4 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 5 6 9 1  5 7 0 3 5693 The resulting TPR profiles of Ru(2.5)[c], Ru(2.5)[c0], Ru(2.5)[i] and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The salt- derived Ru(2.5)[i] showed a broad peak at about 190 C with a shoulder at 155 C , which can be assigned to the reduction of RuO2 to Ru0. This value is in good agreement with that reported in a recent work, in which a hydrogen reduction peak was observed at 480 K over a Ru/g-Al2O3 catalyst [42]. This similarity was not surprising as the same preparation methods were used: therein, the authors had also prepared their catalysts by impregnation of the support in an aqueous solution of RuCl3.nH2O, followed by drying and calcinations.
The TPR profile of Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] in Fig. 2 shows a broad response, peaking at about 170 C, with another smaller peak at lower temperature of 120 C. This can be attributed to the presence of PtO species, which are reducible at lower temperatures than RuO2 [43]. The lowering of the RuO2 reduction temperature can be attributed to the effect of Pt addition for Pt is more easily reduced than Ru, as had been suggested by Bi et al. in their studies of Ru/ZrO2 and Pt-Ru/ ZrO2 catalysts [43].
Interestingly,the reduction peak maximum of the Ru(2.5)[c0] and Ru(2.5)[c] catalysts were shifted to a much higher temperature of about 350 to 380 C.
The increased difficulty in reduction is probably due to a stronger metal-support interaction as a result of decreased metallic particle size [44,45]. This is consistent with the hypothesis that smaller nanoparticles can be obtained from organometallic cluster precursors.
The higher reduction temperature of Ru(2.5)[c] than Ru(2.5)[c0] (380 vs. 350 C) supports that charged cluster precursors has stronger cluster- support electrostatic interactions.
TEM and H2-TPD studies support the above conclusions.
TEM micrographs of the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.
It should be pointed out that under the reduction conditions used (800 C, 1 h under pure H2), metal sintering is often observed. Nonetheless, Ru particle sizes of cluster-derived catalyst Ru(2.5)[c] (w1 to 2 nm) remained much smaller than those of salt-derived Ru(2.5)[i] (w5 nm) and commercial Ru(5)[com] (w10 nm). Table 1 summarises the data calculated from H2-TPD results. The metal dispersion, expressed in terms of H/Ru ratio, of the cluster-derived catalysts is more than 3 times that of the salt-derived catalysts.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the compositions and electronic states of the supported particles. Unfortunately, the principal photoelectron spectral lines of Ru3d5/2 and Pt4f7/2 fall in similar regions as those of C1s and Al2 p, respectively. It was thus difficult to identify the various chemical states of all the elements unambiguously.
Nonetheless, as listed in Table 2, some chemical states were identified. The identified Ru states corresponded to Ru0 and RuO2 for pre-reduced Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] and Ru(5)Pt(2)[i], as well as to Ru0 for pre-reduced Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]. In addition, a Pt0 state was also assigned for both Ru(5)Pt(2)[i] and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalysts, though that of the cluster-derived catalyst was found to be considerably more electron deficient. A striking difference was noted for the Ru:Pt surface atomic ratios of the Ru(5)Pt(2)[i] and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalysts, which were calcu- lated using area ratios of Ru3d and Pt4f to be 22.65 and 5.45,respectively (see Table 2). It thus appears that the bulk of the Pt was embedded under layers of Ru, and indeed, may also account for the absence of Pt signals for the Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] catalyst. Recently, Alayoglu et al. reported marked improve- ments in the preferential oxidation of CO in H2 feeds by RuPt Fig. 1  An organometallic cluster can be simplistically viewed as a metallic core (represented as dark grey centres above) surrounded by a ligand shell (represented as light grey spheres above).

The authors attributed the enhanced perfor- mance to the increased availability of Pt surface sites on the RuPt core-shell particles. Their results suggest a more selective oxidation of CO over H2 for the cluster-derived Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalyst as compared to the salt-derived cata- lysts, as the latter have Pt-poor surfaces. This may possibly account for the better CO2 selectivity of the cluster-derived catalyst. At this point, we would also like to emphasize the excellent control of bimetallic ratios that one has when using the cluster decarbonylation method over the conventional impregnation method. Note that the Ru:Pt surface atomic ratio of the cluster-derived catalyst (Ru:Pt z 5.45) was remarkably similar to the desired Ru:Pt molar ratio of 5; on the other hand, for the salt-derived catalyst, Ru dominates the surface (Ru:Pt z 22.65).
3.3.
Catalytic performance The catalytic activities evaluated in terms of ethanol conver- sion of the three cluster-derived catalysts, the salt-derived Ru(2.5)[i], Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i], Rh(1) catalysts,the commercial Ru(5)[com] catalyst, as well as the Co(2.5) catalyst, are pre- sented in Fig. 4. As reported [28], the Co(2.5) catalyst was indeed highly active at low temperatures (500 C and lower), and had the highest ethanol conversion among all non-cluster-derived catalysts. Strikingly, the three cluster-derived catalysts were found to be significantly more active than all Ru-based salt- derived catalysts, Ru(5)[com] and Co(2.5). For example, at a reforming temperature of 500 C, conversion of ethanol was almost complete over the cluster-derived catalysts,as compared to conversions of 50 % or lower for the others.

Note that the Rh catalyst is often considered as one of the most active catalyst for ethanol steam reforming reaction [12,24,25].
The CO2 selectivities of the various catalysts are presented in Fig. 5. For effective hydrogen production, ethanol steam reforming catalysts should have low selectivities for hydrogen containing compounds (principally acetaldehyde, ethylene,ethane, methane, but also other hydrocarbons). Also, as mentioned in the introduction, PEMFCs have low CO-toler- ance. As such, a high CO2 selectivity is desirable. The CO2 selectivities at 800 C were similar for all catalysts. However,with decreasing temperatures, the improved CO2 selectivities of the cluster-derived catalysts became evident. The CO2 selectivities of the cluster-derived catalysts peaked at approximately 500600 C, and fell sharply at lower tempera- tures. At 350 C, negligible amounts of CO2 were detected over all catalysts except Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] (w20%). These results suggest that Pt would be a useful co-catalyst for low temper- ature ethanol steam reforming, presumably as a promoter of the water gas shift reaction [4] in the presence of excess steam (Eq. (5)).
CO  H2O / CO2  H2
(5) The improved ethanol steam reforming efficiencies of the cluster-derived catalysts over the others become more evident when the hydrogen yields YH2 are calculated. In the presence of excess steam,the reaction produces a theoretical maximum of six moles of H2 for each mole of injected ethanol (see Eq. (1)). As presented in Fig. 6, the cluster-derived cata- lysts were producing hydrogen at, or close to, the theoretical maximum for reforming temperatures of 550 C or greater. At 500 C, YH2 became negligible over the Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i], Ru(2.5)[i],and Ru(5)[com] catalysts, while Co(2.5) and Rh(1) yielded about 1 and 3.5 moles of H2 per mole of ethanol substrate, respec- tively. In comparison, at this same temperature, the various cluster-derived catalysts still had H2/EtOH molar yields of approximately 4.5 to 5.5.

In addition, the cluster-derived catalysts were as active, and slightly more selective, than a Rh catalyst. Under the reaction conditions used herein, optimal reforming temperatures over the cluster-derived catalysts would lie between 500 to 600 C, while those of the other catalysts would be at least 100 C higher. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of organometallic clusters as catalyst precursors.
3.4.
Influence of GHSV on catalytic performance It should be pointed out that a Co/ZnO catalyst was reported to have 100% ethanol conversion at 450 C [28]. However,a conversion of only 20% was obtained at this same temper- ature under our conditions using Co(2.5). A plausible expla- nation would be the different experimental conditions used in the two works. Several factors, such as the steam/ethanol ratio and the rate at which ethanol is introduced would,a priori, affect the percentage conversion of ethanol.

The more likely factor is the gas hourly space velocity (GSHV), which represents the relation between the volumetric gas flow to the volume of the catalyst [50]. In that work, the GHSV was varied from between 1,250 h1 to 30,000 h1; 100% ethanol conversion was achieved only at GHSV of 15,000 h1 or lower, while at higher GHSV, and thus shorter contact times,ethanol conversion was Fig. 7  (a) Ethanol conversions over the three cluster-derived catalysts at gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) of 180,000 hL1 (filled symbols) and 360,000 hL1 (open symbols).

For example, at a GHSV of 30,000 h1, the reported conversion was approximately 65% (Fig. 2 of ref. [28]). In this paper, a much higher GHSV of approximately 360,000 h1 was used. It is thus highly plausible that with the much shorter contact times experienced in our catalytic runs, lower ethanol conversions were obtained over Co(2.5).
As it appears that the conversion of ethanol is highly dependent on the space velocity, a further series of tests was done with the GHSV halved to 180,000 h1. As can be seen from Fig. 7(a), lowering the GHSV leads to a corresponding increase in catalytic activity of the three cluster-derived catalysts. This clearly shows that, as predicted, higher ethanol conversions were obtained with longer contact times. The influence of GHSV on the selectivity of various C- containing products, at temperatures of 400 C and 600 C, is also presented in Fig. 7(b). At 600 C, the product distribution remains relatively constant over
GHSV
of 180,000 to 360,000 h1. Ethanol conversion was also almost complete and invariant, suggesting all three cluster-derived catalysts were operating close to the thermodynamic equilibrium at this temperature. On the other hand, differences in the product distribution were observed at 400 C. When GHSV was lowered, significant increases in CO2 and CH4 were observed, with accompanying drops in CO and CH3CO. Only traces of C2H4 were detected in all cases. These results suggest that, at low reforming temperatures, ethanol dehy- drogenation dominates over ethanol dehydration at the beginning. At longer contact times, the acetaldehyde thus formed is further reformed or decomposed, accounting for the observed increases in CO2 and CH4. Note that a similar trend had been previously reported by Cavallaro et al. over a Rh/Al2O3 catalyst [51].

Stability of catalysts The long-term stability on-stream of cluster-derived catalyst, Ru(2.5)[c0] was evaluated,along with the commercial Ru(5)[com] catalyst for comparison. Their time-on-stream behaviours, monitored at a constant reforming temperature of
600 C,
are presented in Fig.
8.
The cluster-derived Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst gave complete ethanol conversion and near maximum hydrogen yields (5.86.0) throughout the 48 h of on-stream testing. The CO2 and CO selectivities were stable throughout at 8090% and 1020%, respectively. On the other hand, ethanol conversions over Ru(5)[com] dropped rapidly from the 16th hour,accompanied with corresponding increases of CO and CH4 selectivity.
The time-on-stream runs showed that the cluster-derived Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst was more robust than a inorganic salt- derived catalyst, maintaining high activity and selectivity throughout 48 h of testing at 600 C. The cluster-derived catalyst was also found to be quite stable over three catalytic cycles, with the regeneration step carried out by heating the catalyst under
H2
at
800 C
for 1 h.
The bimetallic Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c0] was evaluated, and its H2 selectivity was found to be relatively stable over the three cycles, although a slight decrease in activity was evident with each run (see Fig. 9). The high efficiency of cluster-derived catalysts has previously been attributed to its small size [11]. As such, it is likely that the observed drop in catalytic activity might be due to 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Conversion & Selectivity / % Time-on-stream / h 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Conversion & Selectivity / % Time-on-stream / h a b Fig. 8  Evaluation of time-on-stream behaviours of (a) Ru(2.5)[c0] and (b) Ru(5)[com] catalysts.

EtOH-TPD studies of catalysts The reaction of ethanol over Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] and Ru(2.5)[c0] catalysts was studied using ethanol temperature-pro- grammed desorption (EtOH-TPD). Admittedly, the conditions used for EtOH-TPD were not the same as the actual catalytic conditions;nevertheless,mechanistic insights could be obtained with this technique, and it has been widely used by others to study ethanolcatalyst interactions [15,5257]. The EtOH-TPD profiles of the two cluster-derived catalysts are shown in Fig. 10. As expected, significant amounts of H2 were detected over both catalysts, reflecting their high activities. Two H2 desorption peaks were observed in each case:around
230 C
and
380 C
for the bimetallic catalyst, and around 280 C and 460 C for the monometallic catalyst. The lower desorption temperatures over the former catalyst suggests a synergistic effect between the two metals. The presence of two H2 desorption peaks had previously been reported over RhPt/CeO2 (445 K, 655 K) [56] and Ir/Al2O3 (520 K, 750 K) [15] catalysts. Some CO2 and CH3CHO were also detected, consistent with what had been previously reported for noble metal/Al2O3 catalysts [15].
However, while the authors only reported trace amounts of CO, this was formed in comparable amounts to CO2 over the cluster-derived catalysts,with the peaks appearing in approximately the same temperature range as H2. The CO2 and CH3CHO peak maxima fell in the range of 350450 C and 100150 C, respectively. These were similar to the values reported by Idriss et al. (650 K and 450 K, respectively) over a supported Rh catalyst [54], but lower than those reported Fig. 10  Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption profiles of (a) Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[cL] and (b) Ru(2.5)[c0] catalysts. i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 3 4 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 5 6 9 1  5 7 0 3 5700 by Erd} ohelyi et al. (750 K and 500 K, respectively) over a supported Ir catalyst [15]. Idriss proposed that for the reaction of ethanol, there is an inverse correlation between the desorption temperature of CH3CHO and the turnover number [58]. A low CH3CHO desorption temperature, as in the case of the cluster-derived catalysts, is thus desirable since it would imply a high ethanol turnover number. Some C2H4 was also formed, albeit in significantly smaller quan- tities. Its formation was expected since Al2O3, which favours ethanol dehydration, was used as the support [15,52]. Inter- estingly, only trace amounts of ethanol were detected,primarily at temperatures below 200 C. This suggests that the bulk of adsorbed ethanol had reacted at low tempera- tures. These results support the conclusions obtained from the series of GHSV experiments (vide supra); indeed, it appears that the decomposition of ethanol occurs mainly via its dehydrogenation over the metallic particles and, to a lesser extent, its dehydration over the support.
Another point worthy of note is that significant CH4 formation was only observed over Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]. In studies on RhPt/CeO2 catalysts, Idriss and co-workers noted that significantly more CH4 was formed over RhPt/CeO2 as compared to Pt/CeO2 and PdPt/CeO2, which led them to the conclusion that the presence of Rh was crucial for a more efficient ethanol CC bond dissociation [56,57]. The authors proposed that, as a first step, the OH bond of the adsorbed ethanol was cleaved (Eq. (6)). Over monometallic Pt or Pd catalysts, this subsequently led to the formation CH3CHO and H2 (Eqs. (7) and (8)). Over RhPt catalysts, the formation of a five-membered oxometallocycle was favoured (Eq. (9)), fol- lowed by a CC bond cleavage leading to the formation of CH4 and CO (Eq. (10)).

(10) where [M] represents an active catalytic site.
In view of our similar observations, it is thus reasonable to deduce that ethanol CC bond dissociation is also more fav- oured over the bimetallic Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] than over the monometallic Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst. Indeed, the desorption peaks of both CH4 and CO appeared in the same regions, as would have been expected from Eq. (10). It should be added that the presence of the CH3CHO desorption peak suggests that, for Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c], both reaction pathways may occur.
Over the monometallic Ru cluster-derived catalyst,the ethanol reaction appears to proceed almost exclusively via the CH3CHO intermediate.

Conclusion Monometallic Ru and bimetallic RuPt supported nano- particles, derived from organometallic cluster precursors,were found to be highly efficient ethanol steam reforming catalysts, outperforming all others that were tested under the identical reaction conditions. The high catalytic efficiencies of the cluster-derived catalysts are attributed to the very small sizes of the metallic nanoparticles. Ethanol TPD experiments suggested that the presence of Pt in the cluster-derived cata- lyst lowers the H2 desorption temperature and increases the efficiency of the ethanol CC bond dissociation. Further, as shown from XPS studies, the cluster decarbonylation method was also shown to be much more reliable in the preparation of supported catalysts of desired bimetallic compositions. In view of all results,the cluster-derived bimetallic Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] can be an excellent candidate catalyst for the production of hydrogen via the steam reforming of ethanol.
