Design of highly active and chemoselective bimetallic goldplatinum hydrogenation catalysts through kinetic and isotopic studies Abstract Kinetic model for the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds on Au/TiO2 has been established by combining the HougenWatson formalism and isotopic studies. It has been found that, with this catalyst, the controlling step corresponds to the dissociation of H2 on gold atoms of low coordination. Taking this into account, a new bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 solid has been prepared that, when optimised, increases the rate of H2 dissociation while preserving high chemoselectivity. The resultant catalyst is the most effective catalyst reported, up to now, for hydrogenating nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of other sensitive functionalities.

1. Introduction
The discovery of gold catalysts for the production of substituted anilines and related derivatives has opened up new possibilities around the chemistry of nitrogenated compounds [1] ,[2] . Regarding the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, the use of synthesis procedures to create well-dispersed metal, and especially gold nanoparticles, onto the appropriated support allows designing processes where inefficient stoichiometric reducing agents such as sodium hydrosufide [3] , iron [4] , tin [5] or zinc in ammonium hydroxide [6] , or catalysts based on PbPt/CaCO3 with iron salts in solution or H3PO2Pt/C with vanadium salts in solution [7] ,[8] can be substituted by more efficient and greener catalytic systems. In this sense, gold can be especially sensitive to discriminate different functional groups in poly-substituted compounds, offering an alternative for manufacturing complex chemicals and fine chemicals [1] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] . Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications [2] . The challenge was then to increase the catalyst activity while preserving its high chemoselectivity.
When attempting to design a more efficient catalyst, it is highly desirable to know the molecular mechanism and the catalytic active sites involved. A contribution to this has been recently presented [21] , in which the activation of the nitroaromatic compound was shown to take place at Au/Ti boundaries, and the reduction process occurs on the gold nanoparticle after the dissociation of H2. Thus, in order to design a more active catalyst one should know if the controlling step of the reaction corresponds to the adsorption of the substituted nitroaromatic compound through the nitro group, to the rate of H2 dissociation on gold atoms or to the surface reaction between the adsorbed nitro compound and the dissociated H2. It is clear that depending on the rate-controlling step, one will take different actions to modify the characteristics of the catalyst to improve its activity.
In the present work, a kinetic and isotopic study has been carried out, which has allowed finding that the rate-controlling step for the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics on Au/TiO2 corresponds to the dissociation of H2 on the gold nanoparticles. Taking this into account, a new optimised bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalyst has been prepared. Thanks to the presence of Pt, the amount of dissociated H2 available on the catalyst surface increases, resulting in a solid that is almost one order of magnitude more active than the corresponding monometallic gold material, and can work in solvent-free media. Meanwhile, the high chemoselectivity of gold is preserved.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25). The deposition-precipitation procedure was carried out by adding to the support an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.01 M) containing a proper amount of gold. The resulting mixture must be maintained for 2 h at 343 K under vigorous stirring, controlling the pH of the solution with NaOH at a specific set point. Then, the resulting powder is filtered, washed with distilled water to remove chlorides, dried in an oven at 373 K, and finally calcined in air at the desired temperature. Depending on the pH of deposition, loading of gold and calcination temperature, gold particles of different sizes and morphologies can be obtained, leading to variable levels of activity [22] .The kinetic work was done with the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council (standard reference catalyst), which contains 1.5 wt% of gold, and this has been synthesised according to the described deposition-precipitation procedure at a pH 7, followed by calcination in air flow at 673 K. In addition, other samples were prepared to obtain catalysts with different levels of activity (see synthesis conditions in Table S1 ).
Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K.
2.2. Kinetic experiments
Kinetic measurements were performed in liquid phase using a batch reactor, and the evolution of composition with reaction time was analysed by taking samples at different times on stream. The experiments were carried out in the same reactor (2 ml home-made reinforced glass vial), keeping the volume of the reaction mixture (1 ml) and the stirring rate (1000 rpm) constant, and using always the same amount of catalyst (7.1 mg of the 1.5 wt% Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council). In a typical experiment, the catalyst is placed into the reactor together with the reaction mixture. The system is then purged with H2, before heating up the solution, in order to completely remove the oxygen from the system. Under atmospheric pressure of H2, the reactor is heated up to the desired temperature, and finally the H2 pressure is fixed and maintained during all the experiment at a selected set point value. Several samples were taken at different times to have a minimum of three results at conversion levels below 20%. The conversion-time results were fitted to a straight line through the origin, and initial rates were obtained from the slope.
2.3. Isotopic HD exchange experiments
Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange experiments were carried out in a flow reactor at 298, 348 and 393 K, according to the procedure depicted in [23] . The feed gas consisted of 2 ml/min H2, 2 ml/min D2 and 6 ml/min argon, and the total weight of catalyst was 125 mg. Reaction products (H2, HD and D2) were analysed with a mass spectrometer (Omnistar, Balzers). Prior to catalytic test, the samples were activated in flowing Argon (10 ml/min) at room temperature (298 K) for 30 min. Then, the gas feed was changed to the reactant gas composition, while the temperature was maintained at 298 K for additional 30 min. At this point, the temperature was increased to 348 K at 10 K/min, maintained for 30 min at that temperature and further increased to 393 K at 10 K/min.
3. Kinetic experiments and models
To study the kinetic behaviour of the Au/TiO2 system on the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, we have selected nitrobenzene as a model reactant. Indeed, the kinetics of nitrobenzene hydrogenation into aniline has been widely studied in the literature with metal catalysts such as Pd [24] , Pt [25] ,[26] , Cu [27] or Ni [28] ,[29] , but no references were found for gold-based materials. According to HougenWatson/LangmuirHinshelwood principles, for describing the mechanism of reactions occurring onto the surface of heterogeneous catalyst [30] ,[31] , different rate expressions can be obtained when assuming different reaction steps as the rate-limiting step.
In the case of the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics on Au/TiO2 catalysts, it has been previously reported that the nitro groups are activated at Au/Ti interphases [21] ,[32] , while H2 dissociatively adsorbs on certain positions of the gold crystals [33] . Considering this previous knowledge, a reduced set of reasonable kinetic equations may be initially proposed as the most probable candidates to match the behaviour of the gold catalyst. These models, which have been summarised in Table 1 , involve that both reactants, i.e. nitrobenzene and H2, are adsorbed onto the surface of Au/TiO2 before reacting, with the adsorption of H2 molecules being dissociative. However, it remains to be known if nitrobenzene and H2 share one unique type of active site or, on the contrary, they adsorb on different sites (with a different nature, e.g. on the top of gold nanoparticles or at Au/Ti interphases), and moreover which step of the process (surface reaction, adsorption of any reactant, etc.) is limiting the global reaction rate. According to the mathematical formulation of the models in Table 1 , it is possible to predict the evolution of the initial reaction rate with the initial concentration of nitrobenzene and initial pressure of H2 for each of the potential mechanisms.
Figure S1 in Supplementary Online Material graphically shows these trends, which will facilitate discrimination among the different potential mechanisms by comparing the real experimental results with the theoretical curves.

CNB = concentration of nitrobenzene; PH2 = pressure of H2.
We have considered a specific range of working conditions for the kinetic study taking into account feasible industrial conditions [34] ,[35] , previous literature on the field [7] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] and our knowledge about the behaviour of Au/TiO2 catalysts [1] ,[21] ,[32] . This space of research is shown in Table S2 , where the range of process variables studied, i.e. concentration of substrate (CNB), H2 pressure (PH2) and reaction temperature (T), has been presented.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Kinetic study
4.1.1. Influence of the concentration of nitrobenzene on the reaction rate
From the kinetic equations presented in Table 1 , it is possible to infer that the effect of the initial nitrobenzene concentration on the initial hydrogenation rate should allow an easy discrimination between models 236 and models 145, since the former group of expressions involve a continuous increase in the initial reaction rate with CNB, while the latter group involve a decrease in the initial rate of hydrogenation over a certain initial concentration of the nitroaromatic compound. Thus, initial reaction rates were measured at different CNB levels under constant H2 pressure and temperature ( Fig. 1 ). It can be observed that for highly diluted reaction mixtures the initial reaction rate rapidly increases when the concentration of nitrobenzene increases up to a maximum (r0 = 0.31 mmol/h at CNB = 0.198 mmol/l), and then decreases when increasing further the concentration of nitrobenzene. This kinetic behaviour for CNB > 0.198 mmol/l, which is the preferred range of nitrobenzene concentration from a process point of view, cannot be reproduced by models 2, 3 and 6 (see the reference curves for each model in Figure S1 ). On the contrary, models 1 and 4, which correspond to a competing adsorption between H2 and nitrobenzene in one unique type of active sites, or model 5 controlled by adsorption/dissociation of H2 at higher CNB values, could properly fit the experimental results within the most interesting range of CNB (0.41.2 mmol/l). Up to this point, three-reaction models, i.e. 1, 4 and 5, could fit the experimental results, and further work is required to discriminate among them.

Influence of the concentration of nitrobenzene on its initial hydrogenation rate at a constant reaction temperature (393 K), constant H2 pressure (8 bar) and constant amount of the Au/TiO2 catalyst (7.1 mg). Initial reaction rates were always calculated at conversion levels inferior to 15%.
4.1.2. Influence of H2 pressure
Eqs. (1) and (4) could be easily distinguished from 5 by evaluating the effect of hydrogen pressure (PH2) on the initial reaction rate (r0) [30] ,[31] , since a non-lineal increase of the reaction rate (asymptotic or parabolic) should be observed for the surface reaction control (models 1 and 4), whereas a linear increase should be observed if the dissociation of H2 is the limiting step (model 5). Therefore, new experiments were performed at variable initial hydrogen pressures (from 2 to 12 bar), keeping the concentration of nitrobenzene (0.418 mmol/l), the reaction temperature (393 K) and the amount of catalyst (7.1 mg) constant. When initial reaction rates at different PH2 are plotted in Fig. 2 , a linear increase in the initial reaction rate can be seen when increasing the H2 pressure within the range of pressures studied here. This kinetic behaviour indicates that, at least for high concentrations of nitrobenzene, the adsorption/dissociation of H2 is the controlling step of the reaction (see curves of reference for each model 5 in Figure S1 ).

Influence of the H2 pressure on the nitrobenzene hydrogenation rate at a fixed reaction temperature (393 K), fixed concentration of nitroaromatic compound (0.418 mmol/l) and fixed amount of the Au/TiO2 catalyst (7.1 mg).We have decided to confirm the conclusion previously achieved through a classical HougenWatson/LangmuirHinshelwood kinetic approach, by measuring the rate of H2D2 exchange with the previous catalyst as well as with a series of Au/TiO2 catalysts showing different activities for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Thus, several Au/TiO2 samples were prepared under variable synthesis conditions (see Section 3 ), leading to catalysts with different activity levels. We could assume that if a direct correlation between the rate of hydrogenation and the rate of H2D2 exchange is observed, it will be a confirmation that for Au/TiO2 catalysts the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics is indeed controlled by H2 dissociation. Results from Fig. 3 show a linear correlation between the rate of H2D2 exchange for the different Au/TiO2 catalysts and their activity to reduce 3-nitrostyrene, confirming that the reaction is controlled by H2 dissociation on gold, and that model 5 represents the kinetic behaviour (see
