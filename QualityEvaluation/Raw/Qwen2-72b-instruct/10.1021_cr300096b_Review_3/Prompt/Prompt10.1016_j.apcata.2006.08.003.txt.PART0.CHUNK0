Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for citral hydrogenation: I. Preparation and characterization of the catalysts Abstract Bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic rhodium or platinum catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method). They were characterized by elemental analysis, transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and by their activity for the gas phase dehydrogenation of cyclohexane.
Elemental analysis of the bimetallic catalysts showed that germanium can effectively be deposited by the catalytic reduction method on titania-supported Rh and Pt catalysts. Moreover, the different characterization methods (TEM, TPR and cyclohexane dehydrogenation) proved that germanium is in great interaction with rhodium and platinum. Nevertheless, some germanium deposition occurred also separately on the titania support.
TEM and cyclohexane dehydrogenation results revealed that both rhodium and platinum particles were stable on titania support under the conditions of bimetallic catalyst preparation contrary to previous results obtained with silica or alumina supports. Effectively, no sintering has been observed when they were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling (catalytic reduction protocol). Their catalytic performances for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction indicate that all the catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C versus 300 C) developed the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect, which implied the formation of TiO(2x) species. Whatever the nature of the parent metal (Rh and Pt), this effect was totally destroyed by air exposure of the samples at ambient temperature whereas one part of the TiO(2x) moieties remained after immersion of the catalysts in an aqueous medium.
1. Introduction
The preparation of unsaturated alcohols by selective hydrogenation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance and constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favoured over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] or by addition of a second metal [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. Recently, Reyes et al.
[19] ,[20] as well as Silva et al.
[21] ,[22] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols.
We have previously reported our investigations concerning the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral over bimetallic Rh-Ge/silica and Rh-Ge/alumina catalysts prepared by a surface redox reaction, namely the catalytic reduction method [16] ,[17] . We concluded that the main effect of germanium addition to rhodium catalysts was to improve the reaction selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols (nerol and geraniol), this effect being more obvious on alumina-supported catalysts. The present contribution is the continuation of the study on Rh-Ge systems prepared by catalytic reduction with a comparison to Pt-Ge systems prepared by the same technique. The important aspect is the influence of a reducible support, TiO2, on the surface and catalytic properties of these such prepared catalysts.
This paper deals with the preparation of the titania-supported bimetallic rhodium-germanium and platinum-germanium catalysts by the so-called catalytic reduction method and the effect of their reduction temperature. In this way, the different catalysts were characterized by chemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) under hydrogen was also used to follow the reduction of the catalyst metallic phase. Their catalytic performances were measured for a model reaction, that is cyclohexane dehydrogenation (structure insensitive reaction) to evaluate the interaction between germanium and the active phase.
The hydrogenating properties of these catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral will be discussed in Part II of this paper.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The TiO2 support (Degussa P25, surface area = 50 m2 g1) was calcined in flowing air for 4 h at 500 C. Prior to use, it was ground and then sieved to retain particles with sizes between 0.04 and 0.10 mm. Monometallic 1.0 wt.% Rh/TiO2 and 1.0 wt.% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by an ion exchange method using RhCl3 and H2PtCl6 as described elsewhere [16] ,[23] ,[24] . Both catalysts were dried at 110 C overnight, followed by calcination for 4 h in flowing air at 300 C for Rh/TiO2 and at 400 C for Pt/TiO2. Finally, they were reduced at 300 C or 500 C in flowing pure hydrogen for 4 h. Catalysts activated following the above temperatures are denoted in this manuscript as Rh(300), Pt(300) and Rh(500), Pt(500), respectively.
Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on metal parent (Rh or Pt) particles and the germanium salt (GeCl4) dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method). A known amount of the prereduced parent catalyst was introduced into a reactor [25] under nitrogen and was activated at the same temperature than its first reduction, i.e., 300 C or 500 C, for 1 h under hydrogen. Then the solution of the germanium precursor, previously degassed under hydrogen flow, was introduced onto the catalyst at room temperature. After 1 h reaction time under hydrogen bubbling, the solution was filtered out and the catalyst was dried overnight at 100 C under hydrogen flow. Finally, the bimetallic catalyst was reduced under hydrogen flow either at 300 C or at 500 C for 1 h (2 C min1 heating rate). Blank platinum and rhodium catalysts were prepared following the same procedure but the germanium salt was replaced by a hydrochloric solution of the same pH, that is pH = 1.
The elemental analysis of the platinum, rhodium, germanium and chlorine contents was determined by the atomic absorption method. All the prepared catalysts are listed in Table 1 with their code name and metallic composition.

2.2. Transmission electron microscopy measurements
Transmission electron microscopy studies were performed on a Philips CM 120 instrument operating at 120 kV. All the samples were embedded in a polymeric resin (spurr) and cut into a section as small as 40 nm with an ultramicrotome equipped with a diamond knife. Cuts were then deposited on an Al grid previously covered with a thin layer of carbon. Average particle sizes were determined by measuring at least 100 particles for each sample analyzed, from at least 5 different micrographs.
2.3. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments
The TPR experiments were done with a 1.0 vol.% H2/Ar gas mixture. The temperature range was 25500 C with a ramp of 5 C min1 and then maintained at 500 C for 1 h. The hydrogen uptake was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector.
2.3.1. Monometallic catalysts
Prior to the TPR, the monometallic rhodium and platinum catalysts were first pretreated in situ under oxygen for 30 min at 300 C or 400 C, respectively, and cooled down to room temperature.
2.3.2. Bimetallic catalysts
The purpose of the TPR experiments was to investigate the hydrogen consumption during the final reduction of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge/titania catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction method. The procedure has been reported previously [17] . In brief, the TPR were conducted on catalysts dried at 100 C under hydrogen and transferred to the TPR reactor under inert atmosphere in order to avoid the oxidation by air.
2.4. Gas phase reaction
Cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out under atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow reactor at 270 C. Injection of cyclohexane was made using a calibrated motor-driven syringe. The partial pressures were 97 and 3 kPa for hydrogen and cyclohexane, respectively. All measurements were performed with a total flow rate of 100 cm3 min1. Analysis of the reaction products was performed by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (Varian 3400X) on a HP-PLOT Al2O3 KCl column. The only detected product was benzene.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts
Monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts were characterized by TPR after being pretreated in situ under oxygen for 30 min at 300 C or 400 C, respectively, and cooled down to room temperature.
The total hydrogen consumptions deduced from the TPR experiments are 189 μmol gcatalyst1 for 1.0 wt.% Rh/TiO2 and 171 μmol gcatalyst1 for 1.0 wt.% Pt/TiO2, whereas the theoretical values for the reduction of Rh2O3 and PtO2 are 146 and 102 μmol gcatalyst1, respectively. These differences are attributed to the partial reduction of the titania support, that is the so-called strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect which generates TiO(2x) species. This phenomenon is clearly evidenced in Fig. 1 which shows a comparison of TPR profiles of 1.0 wt.% Rh/TiO2 and 1.0 wt.% Rh/Al2O3 catalysts. The vertical dotted line at 345 C indicates when the H2 consumption reaches 146 μmol gcatalyst1 for the 1.0 wt.% Rh/TiO2 sample. If we admit that all the rhodium is reduced before the support, this temperature would then correspond to the beginning of the partial reduction of TiO2.

3.2. Deposition of germanium on Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts
The purpose of the preparation of bimetallic catalysts by the catalytic reduction method is to deposit germanium by redox reaction between hydrogen activated over the metal parent surface and germanium ions following the procedure described in the experimental part. Indeed, the electrochemical potential of the Ge4+/Ge0 couple (0.124 V/SHE) would allow the reduction of Ge4+ ions by hydrogen adsorbed on rhodium or platinum.
3.2.1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2
Fig. 2 displays the amount of germanium deposited on the two parent rhodium/titania catalysts (Rh(300) and Rh(500)) as a function of the germanium content initially introduced in solution. Curves (a) and (b) of Fig. 2 show that the amount of germanium deposited on both parent catalysts increases with the germanium content of the solution. However, the Ge deposition is not complete, with the exception of Rh(300)/TiO2 when the initial amount of germanium in solution is lower or equal to 1.0 wt.% ( Fig. 2 , curve (a)).

Ge (wt.%) deposited by catalytic reduction (under hydrogen flow) over Rh/titania catalysts reduced at (a, ) 300 C and (b, ) 500 C as a function of the Ge (wt.%) introduced in solution. Same experiments performed under nitrogen flow on Rh/titania catalysts reduced at () 300 C and () 500 C.
Comparing curves (a) and (b) of Fig. 2 for a same germanium content in the solution, it appears that the amount of germanium deposited is more important when Rh/TiO2 is reduced at 300 C than at 500 C, despite their similar metallic particle sizes ( Table 1 ). This behaviour may result from the titania support which is partially reduced during the reduction step of the catalyst at high temperature (500 C) and then covers one part of the active Rh surface (SMSI effect) [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] .
It should be reminded that the preparation of bimetallic catalysts by the catalytic reduction method consists in depositing germanium by redox reaction between hydrogen activated over the rhodium (or platinum) surface and germanium ions. However, the deposition reaction may compete with the adsorption of the germanium salt on the support (depending on the nature of the support and the operating conditions). Effectively, in the case of bimetallic Rh-Ge/alumina and Rh-Ge/silica catalysts, it was observed some additive deposition on alumina, while no deposit occured on silica support [16] . Then, in order to determine the contribution of the TiO2 support, same experiments were carried out under nitrogen flow instead of hydrogen for 2.5 wt.% Ge initially introduced in solution. The results reported in Fig. 2 indicate that whatever the reduction temperature of the parent catalyst some germanium deposition indeed occurs under nitrogen flow on the titania support. Nevertheless, the greater additive deposition under hydrogen flow compared to that observed under nitrogen (1.6 wt.% Ge versus 0.8 wt.% Ge for Rh(300) and 1.3 wt.% Ge versus 0.7 wt.% for Rh(500)) bolsters that hydrogen activated on the parent metal particles participates to the deposition reaction. If we assume that the difference between the Ge deposition under H2 and N2 flows corresponds to the part of Ge effectively deposited on Rh by redox reaction, the average Ge/RhS atomic ratio can be estimated. That is 3.1Ge deposited per surface Rh atom for Rh(300) and 2.3Ge for Rh(500). The number of surface rhodium atoms were calculated from the average metallic particle size of the blank catalysts determined by TEM measurements ( Table 1 ). The values of Ge/RhS indicate that the Ge deposition certainly occurs as tridimensionnal islands on Rh surface. Some Ge can also be deposited at the Rhsupport interface. Moreover, the lower Ge/RhS obtained for Rh(500) is in accordance with the fact that one part of Rh surface is covered by TiO(2x) species.
3.2.2. Bimetallic Pt-Ge/TiO2
Fig. 3 shows that the germanium deposition on Pt(300)/TiO2 (curve (a)) and Pt(500)/TiO2 (curve (b)) is similar when the germanium content initially introduced in solution does not exceed 0.5 wt.% and is slightly higher on Pt(300)/TiO2 beyond 0.5 wt.%. The amount of germanium deposited increases with the content introduced in solution, as previously observed with Rh based catalysts. However, the deposition is smaller on Pt based catalysts. This result is not surprising since Rh and Pt metal loading was kept constant at 1.0 wt.%. Consequently, considering the atomic weights, the number of rhodium atoms is almost twice higher than that of platinum.

3.3. Transmission electron microscopy measurements
The different monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts, selected bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts and rhodium and platinum blank catalysts (prepared following the catalytic reduction procedure but without addition of the germanium salt) were characterized by TEM after reduction at 300 C and 500 C.
In all cases the TEM images reveal small and well-dispersed particles on the titania support. Moreover, analysis of these micrographs indicates a narrow particle size distribution. Examples of characteristic images and size distribution histograms obtained for blank Pt(500)/TiO2 and Pt(500)-0.4Ge/TiO2 catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 . Average particle sizes obtained through analysis of similar TEM images for all other considered samples are summarized in Table 1 .

TEM images and metal particle size distributions of: (a) the blank Pt(500)/TiO2 and (b) the bimetallic Pt(500)-0.4Ge/TiO2 catalysts.TEM characterization of the blank Rh/titania and blank Pt/titania catalysts, reduced at 300 C or 500 C, showed a mean particle size comparable to that of their parent Rh/titania and Pt/titania catalysts ( Table 1 ). In other words, the blank treatment does not lead to a sintering of the parent metal particles. In previous works, it was observed that hydrogen adsorbed on metal particles promotes the sintering of supported rhodium or platinum over silica in aqueous medium [16] ,[23] ,[26] . It was also reported that, under such conditions, rhodium and platinum supported on alumina are less sensitive to sintering [16] ,[23] ,[26] . Then, the present results indicate that both rhodium and platinum particles are stable on titania support contrary to silica or alumina supports when they are immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling (catalytic reduction protocol).It should be pointed out that the reduction temperature (300 C or 500 C) of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts has no effect on the particle size distribution and then on the mean particle size ( Table 1 ). The average particle size of the bimetallic catalysts slightly increases with Ge addition which is in accordance with a Ge deposition onto the parent metal particles.
3.4. Characterization of catalysts by temperature-programmed reduction
In order to follow the hydrogen consumption in the course of the final reduction of blank and bimetallic catalysts, the different samples were characterized by TPR. At the end of the preparation by surface redox reaction, blank and bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts were dried overnight at 100 C under hydrogen flow. After flushing with nitrogen at ambient temperature, the catalysts were introduced into the TPR reactor without exposure to air and switched to the H2/Ar mixture.
The obtained results being nearly the same for Rh and Pt based catalysts, only the TPR concerning Rh systems are detailed in this part.
3.4.1. Blank catalysts
TPR profiles corresponding to the reduction of blank Rh(300)/TiO2 and blank Rh(500) catalysts are presented in Fig. 5 . For both catalysts, an hydrogen consumption is observed from the ambient temperature which corresponds to the adsorption of weakly bound hydrogen on reduced rhodium particles since the catalyst has already undergone a drying treatment under hydrogen until 100 C and a further degassing under inert gas before the TPR experiment. A second hydrogen consumption, which can be attributed to the partial reduction of the titania support, appears from 300 C in the case of the blank Rh(300)/TiO2 and only around 350 C for the blank Rh(500)/TiO2. The total hydrogen comsumption is 65 μmol gcatalyst1 for the blank Rh(300) versus 52 μmol gcatalyst1 for the blank Rh(500).

In short, the blank Rh(500) presents a shift of about 50 C toward higher reduction temperatures as well as a lower H2 consumption than the blank Rh(300). These observations tell us that some substoichiometric TiO(2x) species formed during the reduction of the monometallic Rh/TiO2 catalyst at 500 C are still present on the blank Rh(500) in spite of the immersion of the parent catalyst in the aqueous solution.
3.4.2. Effect of the germanium content
The TPR curves of the Rh(300)-Ge/TiO2 bimetallic catalysts were compared to that of the blank Rh(300)/TiO2 and the 2.5 wt.% Ge/TiO2 monometallic catalysts which were submitted to the same treatment before the TPR experiments (drying under hydrogen at 100 C and flushing with nitrogen).
The results summarized in Fig. 6 indicate that the addition of germanium modifies the shape of the TPR curve of rhodium. The observed evolutions are in complete accordance with our previous work dealing with Rh-Ge/Al2O3 [17] . In brief, the first peak near 35 C can be correlated to the same peak observed above on the blank catalysts and attributed to the adsorption of weakly bound hydrogen on reduced rhodium particles. Nevertheless, this hydrogen consumption is all the more high as the germanium content is low. Then, it corresponds also to the hydrogen adsorption on Rh-Ge species containing few germanium atoms. In the 150300 C temperature range, the hydrogen consumption increasing with Ge content means that partially oxidized germanium atoms are reduced. Otherwise, this reduction of the germanium species is promoted by rhodium since the reduction of the monometallic germanium catalyst starts only at 300 C ( Fig. 6 ). Finally, at 300 C start the reduction of oxidized germanium species isolated on titania support as well as the partial reduction of TiO2.

3.5. Catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation
The different catalysts were tested for a structure insensitive reaction [27] ,[28] ,[29] , the cyclohexane dehydrogenation, at 270 C and at atmospheric pressure. The deposition of a catalytically inert metal (germanium) on rhodium and platinum would greatly affect the activity of the parent catalysts. This reaction would then permit to evaluate the interaction between germanium and the active phase after reduction.
3.5.1. Effect of the germanium content
First, the data reported in Table 2 indicate that the specific activity of the parent and the blank catalysts are comparable. This observation bolsters that the blank treatment of the monometallic Rh/titania and Pt/titania catalysts does not lead to a sintering of metal particles. It confirms the high stability of the metallic phase on TiO2, previously observed from TEM analysis.

Rh(500) parent 500 3.1 Rh(500) blank 500 2.3 Rh(500) blank 300 4.4
Pt(300) parent 300 19.4 Pt(300) blank 300 18.7
Pt(500) parent 500 10.0 Pt(500) blank 500 8.5 Pt(500) blank 300 18.0 Moreover, the lower activities observed for the catalysts reduced at 500 C instead of 300 C is in accordance with the SMSI effect developped by TiO2-supported catalysts reduced at high temperature. Indeed, the TiO(2x) species cover one part of the metallic active surface leading to a decrease of the specific activity. This decrease is more pronounced with Pt (near 50%) than with Rh (near 30%) parent catalysts, suggesting than Pt is more sensitive than Rh to the SMSI. This difference of sensitivity between the two metals has already been reported in the literature and deduced from conductivity measurements [30] .
The evolution of the catalytic properties of bimetallic Rh(300), Rh(500) and Pt(300), Pt(500) based catalysts is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the Ge/parent metal (Rh or Pt) atomic ratio. From this figure it can be seen that whatever the reduction temperature of the catalysts, the addition of germanium strongly inhibits the specific activity of platinum and rhodium, this effect being all the more significant as the Ge/parent metal atomic ratio is high. This result suggests a great interaction between the two metals (Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge). Otherwise, the catalytic properties of Rh-Ge/titania catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction (then under hydrogen flow) were compared to that of catalysts prepared by the same way but under nitrogen flow. From Fig. 7 , it can be observed that the effect of germanium depends on the preparation protocol. Indeed, all the catalysts present comparable particle sizes but the inhibiting effect of germanium is lower on the catalysts prepared under nitrogen. The effect of germanium of such catalysts corresponds to that of catalysts prepared under hydrogen with lower Ge loadings. These results prove that activated hydrogen in the course of the catalytic reduction is mainly responsible for germanium deposition in great interaction with the parent metal.

Catalysts prepared under nitrogen flow: () Rh(300)-Ge/TiO2 and () Rh(500)-Ge/TiO2.
On the other hand, it appears that whatever the Ge loading, the bimetallic catalysts reduced at 300 C are less deactivated than their couterparts reduced at 500 C. This result can be explained by the covering of the active Rh and Pt metal surface by TiO(2x) species generated by the strong metalsupport interaction effect developed during the reduction step of the catalyst at high temperature (500 C). So, for a same Ge content, Rh and Pt are more poisoned after reduction at 500 C than after reduction at 300 C. Nevertheless, two other factors can also contribute to this phenomenon: a change of the reduction degree of germanium in contact with rhodium after reduction at 500 C as well as a germanium migration over the support to the parent metal after reduction at 500 C, which would lead to a germanium enrichment of bimetallic particles.
Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 7 that for a same Ge/parent metal atomic ratio, the reaction is more strongly poisoned by added germanium to platinum than rhodium, whatever the reduction temperature of the catalysts. Then, it seems that germanium modifies more the catalytic properties of platinum particles than the rhodium ones. The phase diagrams for binary alloys of Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge allow one to explain this result. Indeed, only Pt is able to form solide solution with Ge, and that from very low Ge contents [31] ,[32] ,[33] .
3.5.2. Effect of air exposure on the stability of TiO(2x) species
The results of cyclohexane dehydrogenation previously reported in the present work were obtained on catalysts exposed to air after their preparation and activation under hydrogen, then reduced again in the dehydrogenation reactor at the same temperature than the initial reduction, i.e., 300 C or 500 C. We wanted to examine the effect of the temperature of this last reduction on the catalytic properties of both the blank Pt(500) and the blank Rh(500).
Table 2 shows that for both catalysts the specific activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is enhanced when the air exposure is followed by a reduction step at 300 C instead of 500 C. Moreover, a final reduction at 300 C of these two samples leads to almost the same activities than the ones observed with the blank Pt(300) and the blank Rh(300).
These observations suggest that the SMSI effect developed during the reduction of the catalysts at 500 C is totally destroyed by air exposure of the samples at ambient temperature. The TiO(2x) species can be restored by reducing the samples again at high temperature (500 C). The total destruction of the SMSI effect by oxidation has been already observed in the litterature but generally at higher temperature (200 C) and depends on the nature of the metal [34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] ,[42] .
3.5.3. Effect of the parent catalyst immersion in an aqueous medium on the stability of TiO(2x) species
In the course of bimetallic catalyst preparation by the catalytic reduction method, the parent monometallic catalysts were immersed for 1 h in an aqueous solution. We wanted to examine the effect of this immersion on the stability of TiO(2x) species formed during the reduction of the parent catalysts at 500 C. In this way, different blank Rh and blank Pt catalysts were tested for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.
After their preparation and activation under hydrogen in the redox reactor [25] , the blank samples were introduced into the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reactor without exposure to air (in situ protocol) and then reduced again. This in situ mode was needed since it has been demonstrated above that an air exposure of the catalysts totally destroys the SMSI effect. For greater convenience and better understanding of this study, the code for the samples will precise in this part of the manuscript: the reduction temperature of the parent catalyst and then of the resulting blank sample as well as the final reduction temperature in the dehydrogenation reactor. For example, Pt-500-blank-300-in-situ-500 means that the Pt parent catalyst was reduced at 500 C, its resulting blank catalyst was reduced at 300 C in the redox reactor and finally at 500 C once in the dehydrogenation reactor. Moreover, the in-situ or air indications define the transfer protocol to the dehydrogenation reactor. All the results discussed in this part are compiled in Table 3 . For each set, Rh and Pt, the given relative activities correspond to the ratio between the activity of the tested catalyst and the activity of the Rh-300-blank-300-air-300 or Pt-300-blank-300-air-300 samples.

Firstly, it appears that the Rh and Pt based samples reduced at only 300 C at each step, so without TiO(2x) species, present the same results whatever the transfer protocol to the dehydrogenation reactor, that is with air exposure or in-situ (1.00 and 0.96 for Rh and 1.00 and 0.99 for Pt, respectively). Conversely, the Rh and Pt based catalysts do not present the same behaviour after a reduction at 500 C at each step. In the case of Pt based catalysts, a reduction at 500 C at each step leads to the same relative activities for both protocols (0.45 and 0.49, respectively) whereas the in situ mode induces a smaller activity than the air exposure transfert for the Rh based samples (0.34 versus 0.49, respectively). In order to explain these different behaviors between Pt and Rh based catalysts, it was necessary to compare the catalytic properties of Rh-300-blank-500-in-situ-500 with Rh-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 and Pt-300-blank-500-in-situ-500 with Pt-500-blank-500-in-situ-500. The results presented in Table 3 indicate that the first reduction temperature has no effect on the Pt properties (0.49 for 500-500-in-situ-500 and 0.47 for 300-500-in-situ-500) while the Rh sample initially reduced at 500 C is less active than its counterpart initially reduced at 300 C (0.34 versus 0.42, respectively). To explain these phenomena, we can hypothesis that it remains more TiO(2x) species on the Rh catalysts than on the Pt ones after immersion in an aqueous solution. This remaining part is then added to the TiO(2x) moieties formed during the subsequent reduction at 500 C.
The results obtained for Rh-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 and Pt-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 bolster this hypothesis. Indeed, Table 3 clearly shows that Rh-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 presents a relative activity close to Rh-500-blank-500-air-500 (0.53 versus 0.49), which means that an important part of TiO(2x) species are maintained after immersion of the catalyst. Conversely, compared to the Rh series, the relative activity of Pt-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 is closer to those obtained with Pt sample reduced at only 300 C (0.82 compared to 1.00 or 0.99).
In conclusion, the SMSI effect developed on Pt and Rh catalysts reduced at 500 C is partially destroyed by immersion of the catalysts in an aqueous medium, this phenomenon being more marked in the case of Pt.
Otherwise, Table 3 indicates that the relative activity of the Rh-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 is almost twice smaller than the one obtained for its Rh(500) parent catalyst (0.34 versus 0.66). Concerning Pt samples, the relative activities of the Pt-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 and of its Pt(500) parent catalyst are comparable (0.49 versus 0.53). These observations suggest that the amount of TiO(2x) species would be the same on the two Pt samples described above whereas the Rh(500)-blank-500-in-situ-500 would present more TiO(2x) species than its Rh(500) parent catalyst. This latter result for Rh can be explained by the addition of TiO(2x) species formed during the last reduction with those remaining on the catalyst after reduction at 500 C and subsequent immersion in an aqueous solution.
4. Conclusion
The preparation of bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts by the catalytic reduction method was performed under hydrogen atmosphere between a parent monometallic catalyst (Rh or Pt) and a germanium salt dissolved in an aqueous medium. The first important result was that both rhodium and platinum particles were stable supported on titania since no sintering has been observed when they were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling. All the catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C versus 300 C) developed the SMSI effect, which implied the formation of TiO(2x) species. This effect is more pronounced on Pt than on Rh samples. Whatever the nature of the parent metal (Rh and Pt), the SMSI effect was totally destroyed by air exposure of the samples at ambient temperature whereas one part of the TiO(2x) moieties remained after immersion of the catalysts in an aqueous medium. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that in this latter case the destruction of the TiO(2x) moieties was more marked on Pt. Otherwise, the remaining part on Rh is added to those formed during a subsequent reduction at 500 C.
Finally, it has been shown by the different characterization methods that germanium can effectively be deposited by the catalytic reduction technique in great interaction with the parent metal (Rh or Pt) supported on titania. However, some Ge deposition occurred also separately on the titania support.
These catalysts were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral, the results are detailed and discussed in Part II of this paper.
