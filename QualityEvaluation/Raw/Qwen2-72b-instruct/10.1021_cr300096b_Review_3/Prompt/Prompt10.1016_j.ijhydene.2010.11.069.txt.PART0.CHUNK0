Introduction Effective hydrogen releasing is very important in the appli- cation of hydrogen energy [1,2]. Among various hydrogen storage materials, ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) has attrac- ted a great deal of attentions as an alternative medium because of its high hydrogen content of 19.6 wt% [3]. Hydrogen stored in AB can be released through either pyrolysis or hydrolysis [4]. The catalytic hydrolysis of AB has been studied using various catalysts [5e8], while precious metals such as Pt and Pt-based alloys have been proved to outperform the other non-noble metals [9,10]. However, the high price and limited abundance of Pt are disadvantageous to its widespread application.
Therefore, reducing the amount of Pt and improving the activity of Pt-based catalyst is necessary for practical application.
Pt-based metals have indeed demonstrated favorable catalytic activities toward AB hydrolysis [11]. Yang and co- workers prepared the Pt3Ni nanoparticles with the diameters of about 5e20 nm by a chemical impregnation method [12].
Lius group synthesized Pt/Ni hollow spheres by a hydro- thermal method [13]. Our group showed the preparation of nest-like PteNi submicrometer-size hollow spheres by a template-replacement synthesis [14] and nanosized PteNi particles by a reverse-microemulsion method [15].
The hydrolysis rates of the as-prepared PteNi catalysts ranged from 242.4 to 4785 mL min1 g1. It should be noted that the previously-reported PteNi catalysts exhibited a relatively * Corresponding author. Fax: 86 22 23506808.

The coreeshell nanoarchitectures, which integrate multifunctionality of individual component into one single particle, are attractive due to the peculiar physical and chemical properties [16]. Recently, Xus group has studied the catalytic hydrolysis of AB with Au@Co coreeshell catalyst [17].
It is found that the nanosized coreeshell catalysts with narrow size distributions and well dispersions display more attention for their catalytic properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have been carried out on the hydrolysis of AB by using Pt-based coreeshell catalysts.In this work, Ni coreePt shell nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs,x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) and carbon supported Ni coreePt shell nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) with small sizes of several nanometers have been synthesized through a simple redox method employing an oleic acid as the surfactant. It is noted that Ni@Pt stands for the coreeshell structure which means that Ni is the core and Pt is the shell. This notation is according to the definition what follows @ is deposited on the surface of what precedes it [18]. The properties of the as-prepared coreeshell nanoparticles were investigated. The results show that the as- prepared catalysts exhibited high catalytic activities for the hydrolysis of AB.

Experimental
2.1.
Catalysts preparation The Ni nanopaticles (Ni NPs), Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs), Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs), the carbon-supported Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) and the carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C NPs) (30 wt% Pt loading) were prepared using an oleic acid as the surfactant, while the submicrometer-sized Ni particles (Ni MPs), Ni1x@Ptx paticles (Ni1x@Ptx MPs) were synthesized without the addition of oleic acid. The Ni NPs were prepared by a polyol synthesis route following modified procedures of a previous report [19,20]. In the synthesis, 20 mmol of nickel acetate and 20 mmol of NaOH were mixed and stirred in deoxygenated ethylene glycol under Ar atmosphere. The solution was heated to 150 C and then 20 mmol of oleic acid was added. The mixture was further heated to 200 C and refluxed for 2 h. For comparison, Ni MPs were also synthesized without using surfactant under the same conditions. The synthesized Ni particles in the solution were precipitated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol. Finally, the Ni parti- cles were dried under vacuum at 60 C for 12 h.
Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method. A certain amount of H2PtCl6 (50 mM isopropanol) was slowly dripped to the dried Ni NPs at room temperature with ultrasonic cleaner applied. The reactant molar ratios of Ni to H2PtCl6 were chosen at 14, 11, 9, 7, and 5 in order to obtain catalysts with different Pt contents. The molar ratios were chosen because the early studies showed that when the reactant molar ratio of Ni to H2PtCl6 was 7, the coreeshell structure was formed [21]. Pure Pt was prepared when the reactant ratio added to the reaction of Ni to H2PtCl6 was 1.8,which far exceeds of the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of the oxidation for Ni to Ni2, so as to make sure H2PtCl6 overdose. As a comparison, Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs with the Fig. 1 e Schematic representation of the polyol synthesis for Ni@Pt MPs (1), Ni@Pt NPs (2), and carbon-supported Ni@Pt (3) coreeshell catalysts.

Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction. Pt/C (30 wt% Pt loading) was also prepared for comparison as the reactant ratio of Ni to H2PtCl6 was 1.8.Fig. 3 e TEM images of (a) Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs, (d) Ni NPs, (g) Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs, (j) Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) and the corresponding HRTEM (b, e, h, k), EDX mapping images and the line scanning analysis data for Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs (c), size distributions for Ni NPs (f) and Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs (i), and EDX spectrum for Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs (l) and Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) (m). i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 3 6 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 1 9 8 4 e1 9 9 0 1986 The present method is different from the preparation of PtxNi1x alloy reported by our previous paper using a reverse- microemulsion method [15]. In the preparation of PtxNi1x alloy, Ni is in the microemulsion without taking out until the alloy formed. However, in order to synthesize the coreeshell catalysts, Ni is departed from the solution and dried before the reaction with H2PtCl6 so as to prevent the amalgamation of Ni and Pt as reported in the previous paper [22].
2.2.
Catalyst characterization The as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray generator, Cu Ka radiation), transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM and EDX, Philips Tecnai F20, 200 kV), and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP). At different stages of the hydro- lysis reaction, the resulting solutions were filtered, and the filtrates were collected for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. 11B NMR spectra were recorded on a MERCU-
RY.VX300 spectrometer with an operating frequency of
128.15 MHz D2O and BF3$(C2H5)2O were used as a lock and an
external reference, respectively.
2.3.
Hydrogen generation measurement The hydrogen generation rate (r) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the hydrolysis were measured in order to evaluate theactivityofthecatalysts.Thehydrogengenerationratecanbe determined from the slopes of the fitting lines that are derived from the curves of the generated hydrogen volumes (measured below 60 mL) vs the reaction time, that is rmL min1 g1 Vgenerated H2;mL=

.
The volume of the generated H2 (VmL) was measured by the water displacement method [23]. AB solution and a certain amount of catalysts were placed in a sealed flask, which was immersed in a constant temperature bath with controlled temperatures. The reaction was performed without stirring because the catalysts will stick to the magnetic stir. A small power ultrasonic cleaner (CREST 175HT, 220 W, 50/60 Hz) was applied during the reaction in order to make the catalysts and the reactant uniform. The outlet exhaust fitted with the flask was placed under an inver- ted, water-filled gas burette that was situated in a water-filled vessel for recording the evolved H2 volume. The hydrogen generation rates are tested at different temperatures (measured below the hydrogen volumes of 60 mL) in order to get the apparent activation energy [24]. On the basis of the slope of the arrhenius plot, Ea is calculated according to the equation lnk  lnA  Ea/RT [25], where the rate constant kmol min1g1 is decided by kmol min1 g1

The presence of a lone pair electron in an oleic acid keeps the formed Ni particles separated. Therefore, the particle size is regulated and controlled.
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples.
Three characteristic diffraction peaks in curves a, c and f can be indexed as (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of face centered cubic (fcc) Ni (JCPDS No. 70e1849). The particles with deposited Pt in curves b, d, e, g, and h display three new diffraction peaks which correspond to (111), (200), and (220) planes of fcc Pt (JCPDS No. 87e647). The patterns of Ni/C NPs (30 wt% Ni loading), Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading), and Pt/C NPs (30 wt% Pt loading) samples present one broad peak at 2q  25, which can be indexed to the vulcan carbon. The XRD patterns of the catalysts show the peaks of both Ni and Pt without any noticeable shift, meaning that the products are not alloys, which are different from the results of our previous paper [15] owing to the different preparation methods used. In the previous preparation, the Pt and Ni atoms can merge with each other well in the in-situ reaction,while in this work, the Ni NPs were separated from the solu- tion before the addition of H2PtCl6, and thus the Pt and Ni are not alloyed but form coreeshell structure [22].
Fig. 3 shows the typical TEM images of the as-prepared products. It can be seen that the particles of Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs are in irregular spherical shape with diameters of about 150 nm (Fig. 3a). A higher-magnitude TEM image of a single particle reveals the coreeshell structure (Fig. 3b). In order to confirm the Ni@Pt coreeshell architecture, the EDX mapping of Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs was tested (Fig. 3c). It can be detected that the green color denoted as Ni element is in the core and the red color standing for Pt element presents in the shell. The line scanning analysis (inset of Fig. 3c) extracted data from the white line in Fig. 3c reveal that the intensity of Pt element is relatively high on the surface and low in the core of the particle while the Ni element presents the reverse distribu- tion. This detection is the typical feature of Ni coreePt shell architecture. Thus, for Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs, the shell (about 10 nm) is Pt and the core is Ni.
The Ni NPs and Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs prepared with the addition of oleic acid are uniformly distributed with the sizes ranging from 2 to 4 nm (Fig. 3d and g). For carbon-supported samples,the metal particles are well dispersed on the carbon surface and no obvious agglomeration is observed (Fig. 3j). From the HRTEM images of an individual nanoparticle (Fig. 3e, h, k), the clear lattice fringes are obvious. A contrast of core and shell structure can be observed (Fig. 3h and k), and the dark core is Ni (1e2 nm) and the gray shell is Pt. From the size distribution histograms (Fig. 3f and i), the Ni NPs are well distributed with an average diameter of about 3 nm while Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs possess the average size of 3.5 nm. The particle sizes increase by about 0.5 nm after Pt formation, which is in accordance with previous report that a Pt outer layer would enlarge the coreeshell structure by less than 0.55 nm [21]. The EDX mapping was also applied to analyze the Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs.

The elemental ratios detected by EDX agree well with ICP results as summarized in Table 1, and the ICP data are used as the ratios of the samples.
3.2.
Catalytic activities We have investigated the catalytic activities of the synthe- sized catalysts for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB solution. Fig. 4 shows the generated H2 amount as a func- tion of time with 7 mg of catalysts (not considering the weight of the support) at 25  0.5 C. The hydrogen generation rates of the released hydrogen summarized in Table 2. In Fig. 4A, the Ni NPs exhibit weak catalytic activity during the hydrolysis of AB, while the release of hydrogen is greatly quickened in the presence of Ni1x@Ptx NPs. The synthesized Ni0.33@Pt0.67 MPs exhibit very low catalytic activities, while the performances are greatly improved when using oleic acid to downsize the particle size. In Fig. 4B, the activity of the catalysts is improved with carbon supporting.
The activities of the catalysts with different Pt contents vary with the elemental composition. As the Pt content increases, the hydrogen release rates first increase and then decrease, showing a volcano-shape trend. The Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs display the highest catalytic activity, even better than pure Pt catalyst. The rates of hydrogen generation for Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs and Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) NPs are 4892 and 5469 mL min1 g1, respectively.
These values are much larger than that of Pt3Ni (w1388 mL min1 g1) reported by Yao et al. [12] and Pt/Ni hollow spheres (w242.4 mL min1 g1) reported by Yi et al. [13],and also exceed our pervious results for submicrometer-size Ni0.88Pt0.12 hollow spheres (w2333 mL min1 g1) [14] and Pt0.65Ni0.35 nanoparticles (w4785 mL min1 g1) [15].
Fig. 5A shows the effect of temperature on the hydrogen generation rates of the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) NPs. The hydrogen generation rates and rate constant k at various temperatures (T ) are summarized in Table 3. The arrhenius plot of lnk versus 1/T for the catalyst is plotted in Fig. 5B. The slope of the straight line gives apparent activation energy of 33.0 kJ mol1. In comparison, the apparent activa- tion energies are usually 39 kJ mol1 for Pt0.65Ni0.35 [15],30 kJ mol1 for Ni0.88Pt0.12 [14], and 62e70 kJ mol1 for non- noble metal catalysts [27e29]. Therefore, the present Ea value is lower than most of the reported data, indicating the prominent catalytic activity of Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading).
Fig. 6 shows the 11B NMR spectra of the solutions taken at different stages of the reaction that is catalyzed by Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading). The initial AB solution presents quadruplet peaks centered at d  23.9 ppm (Fig. 6a), which coincides with previous results [30,31]. After reaction for 30 s, the intensities of the quadruplet peaks become lower (Fig. 6b), indicating the break of BeN and BeH bonds in AB [14]. After hydrolysis for 1 min, the 11B quadruplet peaks vanish, and a new peak centered at d  9.8 ppm appears (Fig. 6c), illustrating the formation of BeO bond. After the completion of the reaction, the single 11B peak shifts to
13.3 ppm, and the initial resonance signals centered at
23.9
ppm disappear (Fig. 6d),revealing the complete consumption of AB [32] Accordingly, the hydrolysis reaction of the AB aqueous solution containing Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs can simply be described as Eq. (1) [33]:
NH3BH3  2H2O/NH
4  BO
2  3H2
(1) The above results indicate that the Ni1x@Ptx NPs outper- form pure Pt and Ni in catalyzing AB hydrolysis, and Ni0.33@Pt0.67 NPs show the best characteristics.

Conclusion In summary, Ni-core Pt-shell nanostructured Ni1x@Ptx and Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) catalysts with average particle diameter of about 3 nm have been synthesized via a surfactant-mediated polyol process. As the catalyst for AB hydrolysis, the prepared Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) outperform pure Pt and Ni catalysts and are superior to Ni1x@Ptx particles with larger size. In the Ni1x@Ptx series, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) show the highest catalytic activities,resulting in a considerable hydrogen release rate exceeding 5000 mL min1 g1 at 25 C as well as high hydrogen genera- tion efficiency and low activation energy.
