Dendrimer-based synthesis of Pt catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion Abstract Well-defined platinum-based catalysts were prepared using fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as templates. Nanoparticles with an average of 40 Pt atoms and an average diameter of 1.5 nm were produced this way, and dispersed on a homemade solgel silica support. Different treatments were tested for the activation of the resulting catalyst, including heating in vacuum or in oxygen or hydrogen atmospheres. A combination of electron microscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and catalytic kinetic measurements were used to investigate the effect of those treatments on the decomposition and elimination of the material associated with the dendrimer and on the activity and selectivity of the resulting catalysts. Neither heating in vacuum nor burning with oxygen was deemed acceptable, because much graphitic material is deposited with the former treatment and metal oxidation is induced by the latter. Hydrogen pretreatments, on the other hand, lead to fairly active catalysts with high selectivity for the conversion of trans olefins to their cis counterparts.

1. Introduction
Thanks to recent advances in materials-science synthetic methodology, there has been a renewed interest in the design of well-defined heterogeneous catalysts [1] . Arguably the key challenge in heterogeneous catalysis for the 21st century is the control of selectivity in highly complex processes [2] ,[3] ,[4] , and that requires exquisite control over the design of the catalytic active site. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are comprised of an active phase finely dispersed onto a high-surface-area support, and the process of dispersion often leads to the deposition of ill-defined phases with a multitude of local structures. Recently, though, novel colloidal and self-assembly approaches have been used to synthesize catalyst with metal nanoparticles displaying excellent size and shape distributions [5] ,[6] ,[7] . Those catalysts have also been shown to display selective behavior toward specific catalytic conversions [8] ,[9] , in many instances for reactions where no structure sensitivity had been identified before [10] ,[11] .
Colloidal chemistry in particular has proven quite adept to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with different well-defined shapes [12] ,[13] ,[14] . Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to control the growth of colloidal particles to sizes below 5 nm. This can be a limitation in catalysis, where smaller particles are often required. An alternative way to grow small nanoparticles, with diameter of the order of 12 nm and narrow size distributions, is using dendrimer templates [15] ,[16] . The resulting dendrimer-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (DENs) have already been successfully tested in a few catalytic applications [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] , and have even been shown useful when used directly in liquid phase [21] ,[22] ,[23] . The use of such small particle size is expected to display unique catalytic behavior in many reactions.
We in our laboratory have focused on the study of the promotion of hydrocarbon conversions by metal catalysts [4] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] , and have recently turned our attention to the isomerization of carboncarbon double bonds in olefins using platinum [7] ,[10] ,[11] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] ,[35] or palladium [36] ,[37] surfaces. It has been traditionally believed that this mild and mechanistically subtle reaction is not affected by the structure of the surface of the catalyst. However, we have recently established that that is in fact not the case: it was shown in our work that the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt metal favor the preferential rearrangement of trans-olefins to their cis counterparts [10] , whereas its (1 0 0) facets (and rougher surfaces) promote the reverse cis-to-trans conversion [11] . As an extension of that work, we are now turning our attention to the effect of particle size, since small platinum particles display unique rough surfaces and also particular electronic properties bordering on those expected from discrete molecular structures.
In this report we provide a summary of our initial results on the preparation and catalytic activity of Pt-DEN-based catalysts for the promotion of olefin conversion reactions. It is shown that well-defined catalysts with Pt nanoparticles 1.5 nm in diameter can be made using a fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer and by dispersing those on a high-surface-area silica support. Activation of the catalyst may potentially be accomplished by burning the organic matter using oxygen, but that sometimes leads to the oxidation of the metal and to a diminished activity. Instead, we show that it is best to pretreat these catalysts with hydrogen exclusively. No significant sintering of the metal was seen until temperatures above 625 K. In terms of selectivity, a trade off between butane and 1-butene formation was seen during the conversion of trans-2-butene, with the yields for the latter increasing with temperature at the expense of the former. Perhaps more interestingly, a high selectivity was seen towards the production of cis-2-butene, its yield amounting to more than 50% of all products formed in the temperature range studied.
2. Experimental
The experiments were carried out using nanoparticles containing an average of 40 platinum atoms encapsulated in a fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer [G4-OH(Pt40)]. These dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) were synthesized by mixing together appropriate aliquots of aqueous solutions of K2PtCl4 and G4-OH followed by reduction of the metal with a tenfold excess of NaBH4 [38] ,[39] . The supported catalysts were prepared by dispersing either 0.25 or 0.50 wt% Pt-DENs on a homemade solgel silica via wetness impregnation [40] . Regular Pt/SiO2 catalysts were also prepared for reference, by impregnation of the support using hexachloroplatinic acid as reported in the literature.
Initial characterization of both the original Pt-DEN made by the colloidal synthesis and the catalysts that result after their dispersion on the silica support was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI-Philips CM300 instrument equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with a Si/Li detector window [41] . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), used to determine atomic compositions and oxidation states, was performed using a Leybold EA11-MCD system equipped with an Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and a 100-mm concentric hemispherical electron energy analyzer [42] ,[43] . Survey and high-resolution spectra were acquired using band-pass energies of 100.8 and 31.5 eV, respectively, which correspond to spectral resolutions of 2.0 and 0.9 eV once the natural line width of the X-ray source is taken into consideration. Infrared absorption spectra were acquired in transmission mode using a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer and a cell designed for in situ treatments [44] ,[45] . The kinetics of conversion of trans-2-butene with hydrogen were followed in a 150 ml close-loop recirculation reactor by periodically taking 0.1-ml aliquots of the gas sample and analyzing them in a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a 23% SP-1700 on 80/100 Chromosorb PAW column (30 ft × 1/8 in. o.d., stainless steel; Supelco) and a flame ionization detector [46] ,[47] ,[48] .
All liquid and solid reagents used in the synthesis of the Pt-DENs, solgel silica, and regular Pt/SiO2 catalysts, including the PAMAM dendrimer, were purchased from Aldrich and used as supplied. The trans-2-butene gas (>95% purity) was purchased from Matheson and the hydrogen (>99.995% purity) and argon (99.998% purity) from Liquid Carbonic, and also used as received.
3. Results
The first step in our research was the synthesis in solution phase of the dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt-DENs) that were used in our catalyst preparation. The size and shape of those nanoparticles were checked by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 , most nanoparticles show a nearly spherical shape, and approximately the same size. Statistical analysis of TEM images such as this led to an estimate for the particle diameter of d = 1.5  0.3 nm. In addition, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data shown at the top of Fig. 1 indicate that those nanoparticles contain substantial amounts of carbon, as expected since the original particles are encapsulated in the dendrimer template. The bottom EDS trace in Fig. 1 indicates that all this carbon could be burned in an oxygen atmosphere at temperatures around 675 K. Not only all EDS carbon signal was eliminated that way, but the Pt signal was also increased, presumably because the Pt-DENs become exposed after the removal of the dendrimer matter.

The EDS corresponds to samples before and after oxidation in an O2 atmosphere at 675 K.
The thermal stability of our Pt-DENs was investigated further using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Fig. 2 summarizes the C 1s (left) and Pt 4f (right) XPS data obtained after annealing the Pt-DENs under vacuum at different temperatures. The Pt-DENs were first deposited from an ethanol suspension onto a niobium foil (the XPS data of which are provided at the bottom of Fig. 2 for reference), after which the solvent was left to evaporate. Only carbon was detected in the analysis of the original deposited Pt-DENs ( Fig. 2 , second traces from bottom), presumably because the Pt particles are masked by the organic matter from the dendrimers. Deconvolution of the C 1s XPS trace indicated the presence of one main peak at 285.3 eV binding energy amounting to approximately 80% of the total signal intensity, and a broader feature around 287.0 eV accounting for the remaining 20% (deconvolution not shown). Although the original PAMAM dendrimers contain several types of carbon atoms, their chemical environments are for the most part not sufficiently different to display measurable differences in binding energy. Accordingly, we assign the main C 1s XPS feature to all carbon atoms bound to nitrogen (aminic carbons) and to hydroxyl groups, and the broad high-binding-energy peak to the carboxylic carbons. This assignment is consistent with what has been reported for other hydrocarbons [49] .

C 1s (left) and Pt 4f (right) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data from our Pt-DEN samples as a function of the treatment used for their cleaning. Data are shown for the nanoparticles as prepared, after annealing to 475, 675 and 875 K, after heating at 1000 K in O2 for 1 min, and after 10 min of ion sputtering.
Annealing of the Pt-DENs at 475 K under vacuum leads to the loss of approximately 40% of the C 1s XPS signal. This indicates a significant loss of the dendritic structure. On the other hand, the remaining C 1s XPS peak is still centered around 285.3 eV after this treatment, which implies that the remaining carbon remains in chemical environments similar to those encountered in the original organic framework. One possible explanation for this observation is that the dendrimer may initially decompose via the breaking away of its outer layers. In any case, sufficient carbon-containing material remains on the surface to still encapsulate the platinum nanoparticles, since no Pt 4f XPS signal is yet detected at this stage. That is no longer the case after annealing at temperatures above 675 K, at which point a small amount of additional carbon is lost, somewhere between 10 and 20% of the original signal, and the remaining C 1s XPS signal is redistributed into two new peaks centered at 284.7 eV (major peak) and 282.8 eV (minor feature). The first feature in this spectrum corresponds to a graphitic deposit, presumably the result of complete dehydrogenation of the organic surface material, whereas the second is easily identified with a metal carbide, a surface film that forms by reaction with the niobium substrate [49] . At this stage a small Pt 4f XPS signal becomes visible, with the Pt 4f7/2 peak centered around 74.8 eV, indicative of non-metallic, oxidized, platinum.An attempt was made to remove the carbon deposits resulting from the high-temperature annealing of the Pt-DEN by burning them in an oxygen atmosphere at 1000 K. Some carbon removal was indeed possible even after a 1 min O2 treatment ( Fig. 2 , second from top traces), mostly the graphitic layer likely to be covering the platinum nanoparticles. The Pt 4f7/2 peak is somewhat more intense at this point, and centered at 75.0 eV, a value consistent with PtO2 [49] . Finally, ion sputtering was used to further remove the carbon-containing surface species. That also led to the removal of some of the platinum ( Fig. 2 , top traces).
Additional experiments on the thermal stability of the Pt-DENs after dispersion onto a high-surface-area solgel silica support were performed using transmission infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy.
Fig. 3 reports representative traces for the catalysts after heating under vacuum to the indicated temperatures, in differential mode (ratioed against the trace from the previous treatment) in order to highlight the changes induced by each temperature. A vibrational mode assignment, based on typical group vibrations [50] and previous reports [51] ,[52] , is provided in Table 1 . The first thing to notice from the data in Fig. 3 is that all peaks but the one at 3741 cm1 point upwards, indicating the disappearance of the corresponding molecular moieties. The 3741 cm1 feature corresponds to the OH stretching frequency of isolated hydroxo groups in silica [53] , and the fact that it appears as a downward peak indicates either that new OH species form on the silica surface or, more likely, that the surface OH are freed upon thermal conversion of the adsorbed Pt-DENs. It is quite possible that the dendrimers attach to the silica surface via H-bonds between the terminal OH groups of the PAMAM and the surface hydroxo species, and that as the organic matter decomposes those bonds break and free the surface species.

The decomposition starts at temperatures as low as 350 K, but is the most significant at 400 K and is almost complete by 475 K. There are some subtle changes in the relative intensities of the peaks as a function of temperature, notably an initial prominence of the peaks at 2934 and 2865 cm1 due to the asymmetric and symmetric CH stretching of some of the methylene moieties. This suggests an early dehydrogenation of some of the hydrocarbon chains. Also to note is the early disappearance of the strong feature at 1301 cm1, which is gone by 450 K. This can be interpreted as the result of the elimination of the terminal OH groups in PAMAM by that temperature. Finally, the broad feature between 3450 and 3520 cm1 shifts to higher frequencies with temperature, perhaps also a reflection of the loss of the terminal PAMAM hydroxo moieties.
The possibility of removing all organic matter and of activating the silica-supported Pt-DENs for catalysis using either hydrogen or oxygen was tested using XPS.
Fig. 4 shows typical C 1s (left) and N 1s (right) XPS data obtained after such treatments. The as-deposited Pt-DEN/SiO2 display two features in the C 1s XPS, at approximately 285.1 and 287.4 eV. The first peak is easily assigned to the dendrimer by comparison with Fig. 2 , while the second is typical of metal carbonyls [54] , and suggests some adsorption of CO on the Pt nanoparticles. A peak is also seen in the N 1s XPS data at 401.9 eV, a surprisingly high value only seen in multiply bonded nitrogen or in amines in highly ionic environments [54] . This again suggests hydrogen bonding to the OH groups on the surface, perhaps with the amine nitrogen atoms of the dendrimer.

Hydrogen treatments may help remove some of the dendrimer material in the Pt-DEN/SiO2, but more severe oxidation using O2 may be needed to remove all that organic matter. Indeed, the C 1s XPS data in the left panel of Fig. 4 shows a shift to 285.5 eV after exposure of the catalyst to H2 at 425 for 2 h, indicating a change in the nature of the carbon-containing species. Significant amounts of carbon are seen even after sequential O2 and H2 treatments at 575 K, but that most likely reflects the presence of carbon from contamination during the handling of the catalyst, during its insertion into the XPS instrument. A better indication of the fate of the dendrimers is provided by the N 1s XPS signal ( Fig. 4 , right), which is reduced by approximately 40% upon the H2 exposure at 425 K, and completely after the more severe O2 + H2 treatment at 575 K.
The degree of Pt-DEN dispersion in the Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts and the possibility of sintering upon thermal treatment were investigated by TEM.
Fig. 5 displays typical TEM images obtained after annealing at different temperatures between 300 and 675 K under a hydrogen atmosphere. Good dispersion is seen in the original catalysts, with Pt nanoparticles displaying similar size distribution as in the colloidal samples, before deposition on the silica support. Indeed, the average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles in the supported catalyst is still d  1.5 nm. The nanoparticles retain their size, without sintering, until temperatures above 625 K, at which point some Pt nanoparticles with diameters of d  23 nm can be seen. Nevertheless, even after H2 treatments at 675 K, the majority of the Pt nanoparticles still retain their original size; those that sinter are still a minority.

Next, the Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts were tested for their ability to promote the conversion of trans-2-butene in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen. A reaction mixture composed of 10 Torr of trans-2-butene, 0.5 Torr of hydrogen, and 500 Torr of argon was used in all the kinetic experiments reported here, which were carried out in a close-loop batch reactor.
Fig. 6 displays typical conversion curves as a function of reaction time at 425 K for catalysts treated under different conditions. The left panel compares the total activity of the catalyst after treatments with either H2 or O2 alone or after a sequential O2 + H2 treatment (all at 575 K and for 2 h per gas). Clearly, high activities are obtained only after hydrogen treatments; treatments with oxygen lead to the oxidation of the platinum nanoparticles ( Fig. 2 ), and that appears to passivate the surface. The right panel of Fig. 6 reports the activity of the catalyst after hydrogen treatments at different temperatures and after different lengths of time. Some catalyst activity is seen after treatments at 425 K, but full promotion is attained only after hydrogen exposures at temperatures of 475 K or above.

Right: kinetic catalytic data after H2 pretreatments at different temperatures and for different periods of time.
Fig. 7 displays the kinetic data obtained at three different reaction temperatures for a catalyst activated with H2 at 625 K. Similar total activity was observed in the temperature range studied, from 375 to 475 K, but changes in selectivity were clearly detected: more 1-butene is produced at higher temperatures at the expense of lower yields for hydrogenation to butane. To note in particular is the fact that the production of cis-2-butene from isomerization of the central carboncarbon double bond accounts for more than half of the products, and that double-bond migration can account for as much as another 3040%. This makes the Pt-DEN based catalysts quite selective toward olefin rearrangements.

The catalyst was precondition by treatment with 400 Torr of H2 at 625 K, and a 10 Torr C4H8 + 0.5 Torr H2 + 500 Torr Ar reaction mixture was used.
Finally, Fig. 8 reports similar kinetic data for a set of regular Pt/SiO2 catalysts, prepared without the aid of dendrimers as the other catalysts reported above. The left panel reports the product accumulation results for a run with trans-2-butene and hydrogen carried out at 475 K, under identical conditions to those used in the comparable experiment in Fig. 7 . In general, the reaction on this catalyst seems to occur at a faster rate, since the final yields are reached by 100 min of reaction. Another, perhaps more important, noticeable difference is that in this case the production of 1-butene is almost the same as that of cis-2-butene: the regular catalysts does not display the same high selectivity toward carboncarbon double-bond cistrans isomerization seen with the Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts. Additional tests were carried out with catalysts of different platinum loadings, between 0.1 and 1.0 wt% ( Fig. 8 , center), and at different reaction temperatures, from 375 to 475 K ( Fig. 8 , right), but in no case the high cistrans isomerization reported with Pt-DEN/SiO2 could be achieved. It should be noted, however, that the differences are not particularly large. This is because the average size of the Pt nanoparticles in the regular catalysts, according to measurements from TEM images (not shown), are also small, on the order of 1.52.0 nm for all catalysts but the one with 0.1 wt% Pt (for which the average size is 1.4 nm). The main difference between the regular and the dendrimer-based catalysts is the narrow size distribution obtained for the latter.

4. Discussion
In this report we summarize the data obtained in our attempt to prepare well-defined catalysts consisting of platinum nanoparticles finely dispersed on a high-surface-area silica solgel support. The platinum nanoparticles were first prepared in solution using dendrimers as templates in order to obtain small particles of nearly uniform size, to test the possibility to manipulate selectivity in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. One challenge in this approach is to develop a procedure for activating the catalyst once the nanoparticles are dispersed onto the porous support while preserving their structure, in particular their narrow size distribution. In this project we explored different treatments, and ultimately tested their effectiveness by evaluating the performance of the resulting catalysts towards the conversion of trans-2-butene.
Supported platinum catalysts based on dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles have been studied by a few groups already in the past [20] ,[55] . The work of Chandler and co-workers [18] ,[56] ,[57] ,[58] and that of the groups of Williams and Amiridis [59] ,[60] ,[61] ,[62] merit particular mention, since they have offered the most detailed characterization of the chemistry involved in the treatment of metal-DEN-based supported catalysts. Given that intuitively the activation of these catalysts is expected to require the burning of the organic matter associated with the dendrimer, most catalysts pretreatments tried so far have involved exposures to an oxygen atmosphere at different temperatures [56] . For instance, catalysts prepared by dispersion of Pt-DENs onto DAVICAT SI-1403 silica were shown to start loosing the dendritic material at temperatures as low as 350 K, but to require higher temperatures, up to 575 K or more, to remove all the amide groups [18] ,[56] ,[58] . Similar results have also been reported using other supports such as alumina or zirconia [62] . However, it has also been shown that oxygen treatments lead to the oxidation of the platinum nanoparticles [39] , and consequently to a diminished catalytic activity. Subsequent reduction using either hydrogen [18] or carbon monoxide [58] was proven in some instances to increase the capacity of the platinum nanoparticles for gas adsorption, and also for improved catalytic activity.The results reported here are in general qualitative agreement with those reported before. In particular, we show that the organic material from the Pt-DENs used to prepare Pt heterogeneous catalysts thermally decomposes in vacuum ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 ) but can be more effectively removed using an oxygen atmosphere ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 4 ). This is true for the Pt-DENs either alone ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ) or once dispersed on the silica support ( Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 ). It was also seen that the decomposition of the dendrimer occurs over a wide range of temperatures ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 ), and may involve several steps, possibly including the partial elimination of the outer layers of the dendrimer and/or partial dehydrogenation steps in the early, low-temperature, stages of these reactions ( Fig. 3 ). A third observation in agreement with previous research is that oxidation of the Pt-DENs occurs upon thermal treatments in O2 atmospheres ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 6 ), and that their reduction to a metallic state and the restitution of their catalytic activity can be achieved upon subsequent treatments with H2 ( Fig. 6 ). Finally, we also report the preservation of the dispersion and size distribution of the Pt-DENs on the silica support upon treatments in hydrogen atmospheres to temperatures of up to 625 K.One key observation from the data reported here is the fact that the Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts are in general more active after pretreatments using hydrogen, ether by itself or after previous oxidation using O2 ( Fig. 6 ). This is the case even though hydrogen treatments alone are not always sufficient to remove the organic matter ( Fig. 4 ). The effect that the dendritic material exerts on the performance of these catalysts is still not fully understood. On the one hand, dry Pt-DEN based supported catalysts have been shown to not be capable of adsorbing any significant amounts of gas-phase molecules such carbon monoxide [23] ,[56] ; only in solutions the dendrimer structure appears to be able to open up and let those adsorbates diffuse to the surface of the metal nanoparticles [23] ,[59] . On the other, significant catalytic activity has been reported for Pt-DEN-based catalysts toward hydrocarbon conversion reactions even without any pretreatment, and high performance has been seen with catalysts treated with H2 only [20] . The same conclusion can be derived from our catalytic kinetic data ( Fig. 6 ). The reasons for this are not fully known, but it is possible for the hydrocarbon reactants to at least partially displace the dendrimer ligands closer to the metal nanoparticles. It is also worth mentioning that our complementary studies on the uptake of probe molecules such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and acetylene on these catalysts show roughly the same trends in reactivity reported here [63] .
Next, we briefly highlight the implications of the selectivity results illustrated by the kinetic data in Fig. 7 . Of particular relevance is the high selectivity detected toward carboncarbon double-bond isomerizations in olefins, either toward cistrans interconversion, which here accounts for more than half of all the products, or toward double-bond migration to the end carbon atoms. The high extent of cistrans isomerization seen here is particularly noteworthy, since the cis isomer is thermodynamically less stable than the original trans-2-butene reactant. Preference for cis formation was previously reported by us on catalysts with exposed (1 1 1) platinum facets [7] ,[10] ,[11] , but none of the catalysts previously studied match the high cis-2-butene yields seen here. We speculate that trans-to-cis conversion requires significant surface reconstruction of the metal nanoparticles [10] ,[34] , and that such Pt atomic rearrangements may be easier in the small nanoparticles used here. This is nevertheless a subject that merits further research.
The other clear trend identified in Fig. 7 in terms of catalytic selectivity is the trade off between the production of butane and 1-butene. A significant decrease in butene hydrogenation to butane is seen with increasing reaction temperature, compensated by an almost mirror increase in the yield of 1-butene. Similar trends were in fact seen before with supported Pt catalysts with both tetrahedral and cubic nanoparticles [11] . Since the two reactions share a common 2-butyl surface intermediate, this trend reflects the relative rates of the two competing subsequent steps, namely, the reductive elimination with surface hydrogen to produce butane and the beta-hydride elimination at the terminal carbon atom to produce 1-butene [31] ,[64] ,[65] ,[66] . The results in Fig. 7 clearly show a lower effective activation barrier for the former reaction. This could reflect an intrinsic lower barrier for the bimolecular butyl + H reaction (compared to the unimolecular hydride elimination step), but may also be influenced by a lowering in the steady-state concentration of surface atomic hydrogen with increasing temperature. The latter could also explain why there is an almost negligible temperature effect in the total trans-2-butene conversion rate between 375 and 475 K: any potential increase in the reaction rate constant for 2-butyl formation (the common intermediate for all butane, 1-butene, and cis-2-butene formation) on the surface may be compensated by a lowering in the steady-state coverage of the surface hydrogen needed to make such intermediate.
5. Conclusions
Well-defined platinum-based catalysts were prepared via an initial synthesis of dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt-DENs) and their subsequent dispersion onto a high-surface-area homemade solgel silica support. The original Pt-DENs display almost uniform size and shape, with most particles being close to spherical and containing approximately 40 Pt atoms. The average particle size was measured by TEM to be d  1.5 nm. Both size and shape were preserved upon deposition of the DENs onto the silica support.
The resulting Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts contained not only platinum but also most of the organic matter associated with the dendrimer template. In order to activate such catalysts, different treatments were explored. It was shown that heating in vacuum leads to extensive dehydrogenation over a wide range of temperatures, with the most chemistry occurring around 400 K, and to the formation of graphitic deposits, which block access to the metal surface. Exposures to oxygen atmospheres at high temperatures burn the organic matter, but also oxidize the platinum particles and therefore render them almost inactive for catalysis. Hydrogen treatments, on the other hand, may not fully remove the dendritic material, but still make the catalyst quite active toward hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The platinum nanoparticles are quite stable under the conditions of these treatments, and do not start to sinter until treatments with H2 at temperatures above 625 K.
The hydrogen-activated Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts were tested for the conversion of trans-2-butene in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen pretreatments to temperatures as low as 425 K resulted in catalysts with some activity, but H2 exposures at 475 K or higher temperatures were required to attain maximum catalytic conversion. The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts proved to be particularly selective for the promotion of trans-to-cis isomerization: cis-2-butene amounted to more than half of all the products obtained under the conditions used in our catalytic kinetic experiments. Also, the same as with other Pt-based catalysts, a switch in selectivity from butane formation to 1-butene production was identified as the reaction temperature was increased.
