1.The literature does not provide a comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. It does, however, describe two methods used in the preparation of cobalt and cobalt-platinum catalysts: classical impregnation and an ammonia method. The ammonia method leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports used in the study, silica (SiO2) and synthetic kenyaite. This method also results in the formation of hardly reducible cobalt silicate phases predominantly on the SiO2 support. The Co3O4 particle size varies between 5 and 20 nm, depending on the support. The monometallic Co samples prepared by the ammonia method on both supports are more active in benzene combustion than the impregnated ones due to the finer dispersion of the easily reducible Co3O4. Addition of Pt improves the activity and the promoting effect is more evident for the impregnated sample. This is explained with the synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of the bimetallic kenyaite-supported samples is attributed to the stronger interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process.

1.文献没有提供支撑双金属催化剂合成方法的比较。然而，它确实描述了用于制备钴和钴铂催化剂的两种方法：经典浸渍和氨水方法。氨水方法导致在研究中使用的两种支撑物，二氧化硅（SiO2）和合成肯尼亚石上形成细分散的Co3O4。该方法还在SiO2支撑物上主要形成难以还原的钴硅酸盐相。Co3O4的颗粒尺寸根据支撑物的不同在5到20纳米之间变化。在两种支撑物上，通过氨水方法制备的单金属Co样品在苯燃烧中的活性高于浸渍样品，这是由于容易还原的Co3O4的更细分散。添加Pt提高了活性，对浸渍样品的促进效果更为明显。这可以用钴氧化物物种和Pt的协同效应来解释。Pt对催化活性的促进效果较小，归因于Co氧化物相和Pt在制备过程中较强的相互作用。
