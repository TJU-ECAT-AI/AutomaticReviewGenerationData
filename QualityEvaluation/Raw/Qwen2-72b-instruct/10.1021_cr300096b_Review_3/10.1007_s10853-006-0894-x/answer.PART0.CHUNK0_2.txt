1.The literature does not provide a comparison of synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does describe two methods used in the preparation of cobalt and cobalt-platinum catalysts: classical impregnation and an ammonia method. The ammonia method leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports used in the study, silica and synthetic kenyaite. This method also results in the formation of cobalt silicate phases on the silica support, which are difficult to reduce. The classical impregnation method, on the other hand, leads to the formation of relatively larger Co3O4 particles on both supports. The ammonia method is found to produce catalysts with higher activity in benzene combustion due to the finer dispersion of easily reducible Co3O4.

1.文献没有提供支持的双金属催化剂合成方法的比较。但是，它确实描述了用于制备钴和钴铂催化剂的两种方法：经典浸渍法和氨水方法。氨水方法导致在研究中使用的两种载体，即二氧化硅和合成肯尼亚石上形成细分散的Co3O4。该方法还在二氧化硅载体上形成难以还原的钴硅酸盐相。相比之下，经典浸渍法导致在两种载体上形成相对较大的Co3O4颗粒。氨水方法被发现产生在苯燃烧中活性更高的催化剂，因为容易还原的Co3O4的更细分散。
