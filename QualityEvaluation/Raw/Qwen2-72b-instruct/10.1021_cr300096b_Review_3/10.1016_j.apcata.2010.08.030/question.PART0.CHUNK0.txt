Catalytic performance and characterization of Al2O3-supported PtCo catalyst coatings for preferential CO oxidation in a micro-reactor Abstract Platinumcobalt (PtCo) catalyst coatings are studied for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (PROX) in hydrogen-rich gas streams. Experimental results show a role for cobalt in improving catalytic activity. The most active catalyst coating can decrease carbon monoxide concentrations from 1% to a value of less than 10 ppm for GHSV values ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1. This catalyst coating can work at a wide window of operation in terms of temperature. Transmission electron microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy show that the addition of Co forms Pt3Co intermetallic compounds and slightly increases the average particle size. In situ laser Raman spectroscopy reveals the co-existence of Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface, due to gradual oxidation of Co by gas phase oxygen within the initial stage of the PROX reaction. The promotional effect of Co during PROX is confirmed and ascribed to this Pt3Co intermetallic compound and the synergetic effect of Co0 and Cox+. The high accessibility of the reactant to Pt3Co species appears favorable and crucial for PROX.

1. Introduction
As CO is very harmful to the Pt-based electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), CO concentrations in the feed stream to the anode must be decreased to a fairly low level [1] ,[2] . The CO tolerance (target 2005) is 10 ppm in steady state and 100 ppm in transient, for a durability of 20,000 h, that will be reduced (target 2011) to 1 ppm in steady state and 25 ppm in transient, for a durability of 40,000 h [3] . There are several methods for removal of CO from a H2-rich stream, including cryogenic separation, pressure swing adsorption, selective diffusion, preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (PROX), and CO methanation. Among these methods, the selective diffusion, PROX and the selective CO methanation have been considered to be promising [4] .
The PROX reaction requires an active, selective, and stable catalyst. A number of supported noble metals, including Pt [5] , palladium (Pd) [6] , ruthenium (Ru) [7] , gold (Au) [8] , rhodium (Rh) [9] , and iridium (Ir) [10] , are now being widely studied for this purpose by various investigators. The interest in PROX catalysts has concentrated on supported Pt-based catalysts due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability. Different promoters, such as Co [11] , iron (Fe) [12] , cerium (Ce) [13] , lanthanum (La) [13] , niobium (Nb) [14] , and alkali metals [15] have been tested for their ability to increase catalytic activity to PROX. Among these promoters, Co is the most common additive in Pt-based catalysts as it shows good performance with PROX. Jain et al.
[16] reported that Co- and Fe-promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were more active and selective than manganese (Mn)-, tin (Sn)-, copper (Cu)-, nickel (Ni)-, and chromium (Cr)-promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Suh et al.
[17] found similar advantages to Co-promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalysts compared with Ni- and Mn-promoted Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. A PtCo bimetallic catalyst supported on yttria-stabilized zirconia was also reported by Ko et al.
[18] to carry out a high CO conversion at 380423 K.
At the present time, PROX reactors usually have a fixed-bed composition. However, compared with fixed-bed reactors, straight-channel monolith reactors with thin-film catalyst coatings are known to enhance the diffusion of reactants toward active sites and they show low heat capacity, thus providing rapid response to changes in the operating conditions [19] . Microchannel reactors with catalyst coatings have negligible external and internal mass transport limitations, as well as enhanced heat transport characteristics. Consequently, these reactors show advantages such as rapid heating and cooling, suppression of hot spots, fast response rates, and easy integration with miniaturized devices [20] . On account of these characteristics, intrinsic safety and easy scale up micro-structured reactors seem to be ideally suited for this reaction when coupled to PEMFC systems in low to medium power output applications [21] ,[22] ,[23] .
For monolith and microchannel reactors, an active catalyst coating is crucial. Despite the potential advantages of these reactors, only a few papers on catalyst coatings for PROX can currently be found, including those of Pt/Al2O3 [20] , RhK/Al2O3 [24] , PtMIX (1% Pt on 50% 3A zeolite and 50% Al2O3) [25] , Cu/CeO2x [26] and PtFe/mordenite [27] . However, for most of these catalyst coatings, an outlet CO concentration of less than 10 ppm was always obtained at high temperatures (>460 K), or with the use of a large number of precious metals in the catalyst coatings preparation. Hence, the challenge of designing and preparing a catalyst coating with high activity and economy to PROX still remains.
A PtCo catalyst coating is expected to show excellent performance for PROX, since PtCo based catalysts in the form of powder or pellets are generally superior to other Pt-based catalysts in performance. However, there are few reports on the use of this type of catalyst coating. To the best of our knowledge, only Kim et al.
[28] have developed a PtCo catalyst coating. Their coating could reduce CO concentrations to less than 50 ppm, but they were unable to achieve the 10 ppm target level, even at the high O2/CO ratio of 2.5. In addition, the Pt loading was always over 1 wt% for the reported catalyst coating. Clearly more efforts are needed to produce an active PtCo catalyst coating at low temperatures that has a low Pt loading.
The most representative reaction model for the PROX reaction over bimetallic PtCo catalysts has been proposed as a dual site non-competitive adsorption mechanism [16] . According to this mechanism, the Co oxide provides active O2 to the reaction and undergoes reoxidation by O2 from the gas phase. Komatsu and Tamura [29] reported that a Pt3Co intermetallic compound is the active species for PROX at low temperatures. The electron-deficient Pt atoms adsorb CO weakly compared with Pt metal, accelerating the adsorption of O2 onto the intermetallic compound surface. The Co atoms in the compound also adsorb O2. The active species and the corresponding catalytic mechanism of PtCo catalysts for PROX still require further study.
In the present paper, we investigate the preparation of an active PtCo catalyst coating in an annular micro-reactor by optimizing the catalyst composition for PROX in H2-rich gas streams. The performances of the optimized catalyst coating at various operating conditions are also studied. To understand the role of the Co promoter in the catalyst, detailed structural studies were carried out using a combination of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), in situ Laser Raman Spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our aim is to clarify the catalytic properties of PtCo catalyst coatings for the PROX reaction and to obtain an active catalyst coating with low Pt loading. The ultimate goal is to produce a low Pt catalyst that can reduce the CO concentration in H2-rich gas streams to low ppm levels at low temperatures and high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst coating preparation
A diagram of the annular micro-reactor is shown in Fig. 1 a. The reactor consists of an internal ironchromiumaluminum (FeCrAl) alloy cylinder coaxially placed in an external stainless steel tube. Gases flow downward toward the annulus between the cylinder and the tube. The gap of the annulus was kept constant at 0.6 mm.

Before starting the coating procedure, all of the FeCrAl alloy cylinder supports were washed with acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to remove the superficial impurities, and then rinsed with deionized water. The FeCrAl alloy cylinder supports were put into a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution for 10 min and rinsed with deionized water. Finally, the FeCrAl alloy cylinder supports were heated from room temperature to 1223 K at a heating rate of 5 K min1 for approximately 5 h, and then cooled to room temperature. Consequently, a thin alumina film was formed on the surface [30] . This Al2O3 film greatly improves the adherence of the catalyst layers onto the walls of the reactors.
The PtCo/Al2O3 coating catalysts were prepared according to the following procedure: A γ-Al2O3 powder prepared by our group with a surface area of 185 m2 g1 was ball-milled for 24 h, and slowly added into a solution of nitric acid, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, and cobalt nitrate under stirring to prepare γ-Al2O3 slurry. After stirring for 2 h, the slurry was left to stand for 2 h. The FeCrAl alloy cylinder was dipped multiple times into the slurry until the desired loading of 3.1 mg cm2 was reached. After air-drying and subsequent calcination at 773 K for 1 h, a catalyst coating was formed. The adhesion between the catalyst coating and the FeCrAl alloy after the preoxidation treatment was very good. No detachment or uncovered areas were observed [31] ,[32] . Catalyst coatings prepared by this impregnation method are hereafter denoted as COAT-(A)Pt(B)Co, where A is the Pt loading and B is the Co loading in wt%. It should be noted that the real Pt and Co loadings measured by ICP are very close to the theoretical amounts of the catalyst during the preparation process.
2.2. Activity test
The set-up to test for activity is shown in Fig. 1 b. It includes a feed gas supply, static mixer unit, evaporator (pre-heater) unit, annular micro-reactor, and an online gas chromatography (GC) analyzer. Before entering the annular reactor, feed gases are mixed in the static mixer. The annular micro-reactor was placed in a self-made tubular furnace. The temperatures of the furnaces were controlled by proportional-integral-differential (PID)-temperature-controllers with E-type thermocouples inserted into the middles of the pre-heater as well as the annular micro-reactor. Two E-type thermocouples were placed at the inlet and outlet of the FeCrAl alloy cylinder support.
Prior to the reaction, each catalyst was pretreated by the addition of water at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min1 using a syringe pump, under H2 flow, at 673 K for 2 h. This novel pretreatment technique of adding water to the catalyst can reduce the size of the metallic Pt particles [33] ,[34] . After pretreatment, the temperature was gradually decreased for 4 h to the reaction temperature in a helium (He)-atmosphere. The flow was then switched from He to a feed stream containing 50% H2, 0.51.5% O2, 1% CO, 020% CO2, 016% H2O and He under atmospheric pressure. All gas compositions were controlled using Seven-Star mass flow controllers.
An online GC with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to measure the inlet and outlet O2 concentrations, and a flame ionization detector (FID) was used for CO, methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2). A molecular sieve (5A) column was used for the separation of He, O2, CH4, and CO. A TDX column was used for CO2. A converter was used after the column to convert CO or CO2 to CH4. As the minimum detection level of the FID detector is 1 ppm CH4, the minimum detector level for CO and CO2 is also 1 ppm. For all catalysts, no significant amount of CH4 could be detected over the entire temperature region of 373473 K. Good reproducible measurements on the catalytic activities were achieved.
Since the change in total gas volumetric flow rate during the reaction was relatively small, CO conversion, O2 conversion, and CO2 selectivity for the PROX process were calculated as follows:where M[X]in and M[X]out are the molar flow rates of X at the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively, [CO]in is the CO concentration in the synthetic gas mixture at the inlet, [CO]out is the CO concentration at the outlet, and [O2]in and [O2]out represent the inlet and outlet O2 concentrations, respectively. CO2 selectivity is defined as the ratio of O2 consumption for CO oxidation over the total O2 consumption.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
2.3.1. XRD
The powder XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-rC powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 100 mA). The diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 1080 with a 2θ step size of 0.02 and a step time of 10 s.
2.3.2. TEM
The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and conventional bright-field images were obtained at room temperature on the model JEM 2100F (UHR), operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For qualitative analysis, SAED patterns were obtained from specimen areas in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of about 100 nm. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was carried out with an Oxford INCA-IET200 attached to the microscope. The catalyst samples were prepared by dipping a Cu-grid (made of an ultrathin pure carbon support film with no formvar backing) into a sonicated dispersion of the sample (catalyst coating powder samples were scraped from the FeCrAl alloy cylinder support) in deionized water.
2.3.3. DRIFTS
The formation of adsorbates on the samples was followed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy in smart diffuse reflectance mode with a Nicolet Nexus 670 infrared spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercurycadmiumtelluride (MCT) detector (resolution: 4 cm1) and an in situ DRIFTS cell with a zincselenium (ZnSe) window. The data were analyzed using OMNIC software. Prior to each experiment, 30 mg powder catalyst samples were pretreated in situ according to the activation procedure described in Section
2.2
. They were then cooled to room temperature in a high-purity He flow. After pretreatment, background spectra were collected at 313 K in He. The samples were subsequently saturated with CO in a 50 ppm CO flow (without oxygen present). The spectra were recorded after blowing He at 313 K over the samples for 20 min.
2.3.4. In situ laser Raman spectroscopy
In situ Raman spectra were measured using a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw inVia microscope). The Raman scattering of the samples in an in situ cell (Linkam, THMS600) were excited by an argon (Ar) ion laser (514 nm). The spectra were collected with 1 cm1 spectral resolution (1800 lines/mm grating). The cell ensured homogenous temperature distribution with a precision of 0.1 K. Each sample was put in the bottom of the cell and exposed to the gases introduced at the cell inlet. The spectrum acquisition time for each sample was 30 s.
2.3.5. XPS
The XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 spectrometer. A monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used at a spot size of 500 μm. The analyzer was in constant resolution mode and used a pass energy of 20 eV. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ag 3d5/2 peak at 0.6 eV was determined from a clean silver specimen. The energy scale was internally calibrated by setting the Al 2p peak at 74.4 eV. Prior to curve fitting, X-ray satellites and inelastic backgrounds (Sherwood-type) were subtracted in all cases. A Gaussian of 80% and a Lorentzian peak of 20% were used in peak deconvolution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic testing for PROX in an annular micro-reactor
3.1.1. Effect of the addition of Co
The effect of the molar ratio of Co/Pt on the CO conversion and CO2 selectivity over catalyst coatings at 393 K is shown in Fig. 2 . Co had a significant influence on improving catalytic activity. The CO conversion increased considerably with the Co/Pt molar ratio increasing from 0 to 6.6, reaching a maximum of 84.9% and then decreased. Selectivity declined slightly from 60.2% to 53.6%, and then increased up to 57.2%. Thus, the optimum Co/Pt molar ratio is 6.6, corresponding to the catalyst coating COAT-1Pt2Co. The reason for the decrease in CO conversion when the Co/Pt molar ratio exceeds 6.6 is discussed in Section
3.2.5

3.1.2. Performance of the COAT-1Pt2Co
Actual reformed gases, however, contain both steam and CO2. Accordingly, we further investigated the PROX performance in a simulated reformate gas containing H2O and CO2. The catalytic activity of the most active catalyst coating, COAT-1Pt2Co, was further evaluated with respect to the effects of GHSV and reaction time.
As shown in Fig. 3 , GHSV affected the performance of COAT-1Pt2Co at 383453 K when the O2 inlet concentration was fixed at 1.5%. With the increase in GHSV, the CO concentration increased at low temperatures (383403 K) but then decreased at higher temperatures (413-453 K). A similar trend was also reported by Manasilp and Gulari [35] for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. This phenomenon might be attributed to the RWGS that occurs more readily at low space velocities and high temperatures [36] . It should be mentioned that, in our case, space velocities have negligible effects on the temperature differences between the inlet and outlet of the reactor. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , for a GHSV of 40,000 ml g1 h1, CO concentrations of 110 ppm were obtained at 393423 K. For 1050 ppm, the temperatures are 383 and 423453 K. At a high GHSV of 120,000 ml g1 h1, a low outlet CO concentration of less than 10 ppm was achieved at 413433 K over the catalyst of COAT-1Pt2Co. This means that the most active catalyst coating, COAT-1Pt2Co, can reduce CO concentrations from 1% to a value of less than 10 ppm for GHSV values ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1. It was also observed that this catalyst coating exhibited a wide window of operation in terms of temperature. That is, with GHSV of 40,000 ml g1 h1, the ranges of 30 K (393423 K) and 60 K (383453 K) correspond to 110 and 150 ppm outlet CO concentration, respectively. It should be noted that the O2 conversion was almost 100% when the outlet CO concentration was less than 50 ppm for all tested GHSV, as shown in Fig. 3 b.

To further evaluate the stability of the COAT-1Pt2Co catalyst, it was continuously operated for 100 h under the following conditions: a temperature of 413 K, GHSV of 120,000 ml g1 h1, and a stream composition of 50% H2, 1.5% O2, 1% CO, 20% CO2, 16% H2O, and He. As depicted in Fig. 4 , initial activation occurred during the first 1 h run. After the first hour, the outlet CO concentration stabilized at a level below 4 ppm and remained at that level throughout the rest of the 100 h test period. Although a longer-term durability test is still essential for validation for practical applications, we believe that the stability observed in the present study demonstrates the high potential of this catalyst as a practical PROX reactor.

Table 1 lists the performances of the catalyst coatings for PROX from recent literature and from the present work. At typical CO and O2 inlet concentrations and under real reformate gas containing CO2 and H2O, the CO outlet concentration is below 10 ppm at 393423 K with GHSV of 40,000 ml g1 h1 and 413433 K with GHSV of 120,000 ml g1 h1 (see Fig. 3 ), demonstrating an excellent performance of COAT-1Pt2Co. It should be noted that the COAT-1Pt2Co coating used in the present work only contains 1 wt% Pt. Thus, COAT-1Pt2Co also has a clear advantage of low fabrication cost. In addition, since the catalyst coating can work at a wide window of operation in terms of temperature and lower temperatures, it is also easy for the control of the reaction with 30 K of rangeability and lower energy consumption.

3.2. Catalyst characterization
3.2.1. XRD
Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of COAT-1Pt2Co, COAT-2Pt4Co, and COAT-5Pt10Co after PROX reactions. The diffraction peaks were weak, consisting mostly of broad diffraction peaks of poorly crystallized grains of alumina. Distinguishing the Pt and Co phases was difficult, even for COAT-5Pt10Co, which had high loadings of 5 wt% Pt and 10 wt% Co. This result suggests that Pt and Co particles are either amorphous or are too small to be detected by XRD methods. A similar result was also reported by Son et al.
[33] .

3.2.2. TEM and SAED
The morphologies and structural details of the catalyst coatings were examined by TEM, to ascertain their crystallinity and particle sizes. Crystals of Pt and Co are expected to yield highly contrasted and morphologically resolved images compared with the faintly contrasted images of poorly crystallized grains of alumina [33] . As seen in Fig. 6 , which shows the morphologies and primary particle sizes of COAT-1Pt and COAT-1Pt2Co against a bright field, a considerable uniformity of catalyst particles was observed for both coatings. These well-contrasted particles, presumably Pt, PtCo alloy, or CoOx species, were scattered on the surface of the lightly contrasted matrix. The corresponding particle size distributions are presented as insets. The size of the contrasted particles, measured from a number of TEM micrographs, ranged mostly between 2 and 5 nm. The average particle size of COAT-1Pt, at about 2.5 nm, was slightly smaller than that of COAT-1Pt2Co, at 2.8 nm. This indicates that miniscule metal particles were obtained from Pt-based catalyst coatings. Small Pt particles are known to interact more strongly with CO and show higher CO oxidation activities than do large Pt particles or bulk Pt [33] . Thus, the increased PROX catalytic activities of the catalyst coatings, as previously described, are partly attributable to the high accessibility of the reactants to the active metal species. In addition, the presence of a large number of dispersed small particles at the nm level is in good agreement with the XRD patterns illustrated in Fig. 5 . This observation may also explain the undistinguished diffraction peaks for Pt and Co phases, which may simply have been too small to be detected. It should be emphasized that the slight increase in average particle size brought about by the addition of cobalt modifier is unfavorable for PROX. Therefore, the addition of Co must be causing other changes in the morphology and structure of the coating that would explain why Co addition promotes the activities of Pt-based catalyst coatings.

SAED analysis was carried out to determine the nature of these putative changes. The SAED pattern for the region shown in Fig. 6 b is also presented in Fig. 7 a. Its schematics are shown in Fig. 7 b and 7c. In Fig. 7 b, superlattice reflections are clearly evident. Species known to exist on the catalyst surface after PROX include the following: metallic Pt, metallic Co, CoOx, and an intermetallic compound. However, superlattice reflections are forbidden for pure Pt and Co. Similar superlattice reflection patterns of the L12-A3B type have been reported for L12-(Al, Ag)3Ti [37] , Cu3Au [38] , and Ni3Al [39] . In addition, the presence of a Pt3Co intermetallic compound (A3B type) in a bimetallic PtCo phase has been reported in other catalyst systems [40] . Thus, the superlattice reflections observed in the current case most likely correspond to a Pt3Co intermetallic compound of an L12 ordered type. The unit cell of a L12 type ordered Pt3Co is shown in Fig. 7 c, where Co atoms occupy the corners of the cell and Pt atoms occupy the face centers. As shown in Fig. 7 a, three weak diffraction rings could be found for COAT-1Pt2Co. These rings are shown schematically in Fig. 7 d. The three rings, from inside to outside, correspond to d-spacing values of 0.267, 0.230, and 0.162 nm and are attributed to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) reflections, respectively. This result suggests the presence of CoO crystals, which have a face centered cubic (FCC) structure (indexed from PDF card: d(1 1 1) = 0.262 nm, d(2 0 0) = 0.227 nm, and d(2 2 0) = 0.161 nm). It can therefore be inferred that both the Pt3Co intermetallic compound and CoO phases are present on the surface of COAT-1Pt2Co.

3.2.3. DRIFT
DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO were measured for COAT-1Pt and COAT-1Pt2Co, which could further give the evidence of the formation of Pt3Co intermetallic compound. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . The bands detected are ascribed to the surface species of absorbed CO as follows: deposited carbonate-like species (bands around 17001300 cm1) on the alumina support, weakly absorbed or gas phase CO2 (bands around 2345 cm1), and linear (bands at 2070 and 2063 cm1) and bridge (band at about 1834 cm1) adsorbed CO on the metal particles [41] ,[42] . The same figure shows that for pure Pt catalyst (COAT-1Pt), CO molecules are adsorbed in a linear (band around 2070 cm1) and bridge manner (band around 1834 cm1). For the PtCo catalyst (COAT-1Pt2Co), no bands at 1834 cm1 could be observed, indicating that the CO molecules were only absorbed in a linear manner. This absence of bridged CO was also observed previously for intermetallic compounds of Pt3Co, PtCu, Ni3Sn, Ni3Sn2, and Ni3Sn4 on SiO2 [29] ,[43] . The absence of bridged CO can be explained by the proposal that the distance between adjacent Pt atoms on the surface of the Pt3Co alloy is greater than that on the surface of pure Pt [29] . Thus, correlation of the SAED in the present case allows us to conclude that the addition of Co gives rise to the formation of a Pt3Co intermetallic compound via the pattern mentioned above. As the intrinsic activity of Pt3Co is higher than that of Pt [29] , the formation of the Pt3Co intermetallic compound on the catalyst surface may be the reason why the PtCo catalyst (COAT-1Pt2Co) exhibits a higher PROX activity than the pure Pt catalyst (COAT-1Pt), as shown in Fig. 2 .

3.2.4. In situ laser Raman spectroscopy
To better understand the role of Co, we also investigated the nature of the Co species present during PROX via in situ laser Raman spectra for COAT-1Pt2Co. As shown in Fig. 9 , no Raman reflection signal was observed for the alumina component because alumina itself is not Raman active [44] . In our case, we focused on the transfer between metallic Co and its oxides during PROX. No effort was therefore made to determine the concrete oxide species, since the Raman spectra for CoO and Co3O4 are similar [45] . Before pretreatment and using H2 and vapor at 673 K, four bands at 674, 615, 514, and 477 cm1 were detected, all of which were assigned to CoO or Co3O4 [46] . After pretreatment for 2 h, these bands disappeared, thus indicating that most of the Co oxides on the surface of the catalyst coatings had been reduced to zero-valent Co species. As can be seen from Fig. 9 , two weak bands at 684 and 488 cm1 gradually appeared with the evolution of the PROX reaction, corresponding to CoO or Co3O4 [47] ). The intensities of the two bands were stable when the reaction time exceeded 60 min, indicating that metallic Co species on the catalyst surface are oxidized by O2 in the feed stream within the initial reaction stage. As the catalyst is exposed to the air after reaction, the bands around 684 and 488 cm1 are enhanced and broaden. This observation indicates that the metallic Co species present on the catalyst surface during PROX are oxidized by air at room temperature. The co-existence of the metallic Co and its oxides during the PROX reaction can therefore be confirmed. It can also be inferred that the redox equilibrium for Co can be achieved with the evolution of the reaction. This result from COAT-1Pt2Co exposed to air after reaction agrees well with the results of our SAED analysis (see Fig. 7 ), which show that CoO is present on the surface of COAT-1Pt2Co after the reaction. When the results of Fig. 4 , Fig. 9 are correlated, the gradual decrease of CO concentration at the outlet during the first 1 h run is found to correlate well with the changes in Raman bands within the initial 60 min for PROX, indicating that the zero-valent Co species are gradually oxidized. This result further suggests that the mixture of Co metal and its oxides are more favorable for PROX than are individual Co oxides or Co itself. To the best of our best knowledge, this study is the first to report the co-existence of metallic Co and its oxides for PtCo catalysts and their synergetic effect during PROX. Park et al.
[4] reported that the role of reduced Co on bimetallic PtCo catalysts is to activate the gas phase O2 during the PROX reaction. Ji et al.
[48] reported that reactions between the absorbed CO and lattice O2 can be observed on the Co/Al2O3 catalysts for CO oxidation. As the gas phase O2 can be activated by reduced Co and turned into lattice O2, we propose that the coexistence of Co0 and Cox+ likely improves O2 activation and therefore results in high levels of PROX activity at low temperatures.

3.2.5. XPS
XPS was employed to explain why COAT-1Pt2Co is the most active among the PtCo catalyst coatings. The atomic ratio of Co in Pt3Co, compared to the rest of the Co species on the catalyst surface (RCS), was determined in order to describe the portion of Pt3Co on the catalyst coating. Since all of the XPS spectra were generated under the same fitting method, the relative intensity ratios of Pt3Co to the RCS peaks obtained can represent the relative content of the respective species [49] . The two following assumptions are applied: (1) A Pt3Co intermetallic compound, as proved above for COAT-1Pt2Co, is present in the other PtCo catalyst coatings tested; and (2) the metal Co species present on the catalyst surface during PROX are prone to oxidation by the air after reaction, revealing that the Co species are in oxide state except for the Co in Pt3Co. The Binding Energy (BE) peaks were fitted at 778.6 eV as the Co 2p3/2 BE of Pt3Co (0.5 eV shift toward higher BE compared with the metallic cobalt phase at 778.1 eV [50] ). As the aim was to determine the amount of Pt3Co on the surface of the catalyst coatings, the other Co species were not differentiated in peak deconvolution.
The Co 2p photoelectron spectra recorded for the three coating samples are shown in Fig. 10 . The XPS analytical results on Co 2p3/2 BE are presented in Table 2 , followed by the literature data of various Co-containing compounds in Table 3 . As seen in Fig. 10 , a peak for Co 2p3/2 was observed at 781.6 eV. This peak was assigned to both a Co surface phase (CSP) and Co oxide [40] . The Co 2p3/2 peaks were clearly accompanied by strong shake-up satellites, which are characteristic of CoO. Because CoO, rather than Co3O4, has a strong shake-up satellite peak that is 5 eV higher than its main peak, as well as a spin-orbit coupling of around 15.5 eV [40] , these strong shake-up satellites unquestionably confirm the presence of CoO. This is in good agreement with the SAED pattern results we obtained earlier in the study (see Fig. 7 ). The intensity of the BE peak was at 778.6 eV, slightly lower than 781.6 eV, which indicates that RCS is predominant. As presented in Table 2 , the activity of PROX is directly related to the intensity of Pt3Co peak, with COAT-1Pt2Co exhibiting the best performance and showing the highest intensity of 6.8 × 102 CPS eV. Meanwhile, the COAT-1Pt2Co also shows the highest intensity ratio of Pt3Co to RCS ( ), i.e. 8 × 102. It can therefore be concluded that the high accessibility of the reactant to Pt3Co species is favorable and important for PROX. Ko et al.
[18] reported that Co species could cover PtCo bimetallic particles on the catalyst surface. As such, there should be an optimum amount of Co on the catalyst coating. Beyond this amount, the accessibility of the reactant to Pt3Co species may decrease, resulting in a low PROX activity. This may be the reason why the activity of COAT-1Pt2Co is superior to that of COAT-1Pt3Co.

4. Conclusions
This study has investigated the catalytic properties of PtCo catalyst coatings for PROX reactions in H2-rich gas streams. An active catalyst coating was obtained at lower temperatures with lower Pt loading. The most active catalyst coating, designated COAT-1Pt2Co, could decrease CO concentrations from 1% to a value of less than 10 ppm for GHSV values ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1. This catalyst coating can work at a wide window of operation in terms of temperature. Experimental results showed that the addition of Co improves catalytic activity. This improvement is partly related to the formation of Pt3Co, coinciding with an increase in the average particle size. The co-existence of Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface were revealed to be a consequence of the gradual oxidation of Co by the gas phase O2 during the initial stages of the PROX reaction. This synergetic effect of Co0 and Cox+ may be yet another reason for the superior activities of PtCo catalysts. The high accessibility of the reactant to Pt3Co species is favorable and crucial for PROX. The continuous operation of COAT-1Pt2Co for 100 h shows that the stability observed in the present study demonstrates the high potential of this catalyst as a practical PROX reactor.
