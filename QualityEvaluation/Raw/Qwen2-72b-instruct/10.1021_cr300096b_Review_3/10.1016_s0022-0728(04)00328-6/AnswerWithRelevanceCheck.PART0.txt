          [1] "For these techniques, however, it is difficult to achieve a consistent alloy composition in the nanoparticles prepared. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition."
          [1] "An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite [18] . Other techniques proposed include chemical reduction [15] , hydrolysis [16] , vacuum deposition [17] , and colloidal methods [19] ."

          Various methods have been proposed for the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, including electrochemical deposition, chemical reduction, hydrolysis, vacuum deposition, and colloidal methods. Each method has its own potential advantages and applications in catalyst production. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition, which is difficult to achieve with other techniques.
