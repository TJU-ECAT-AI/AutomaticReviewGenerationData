1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature provided to answer the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and how they compare to traditional metal oxide supports in terms of structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also not addressed in the provided literature.
