1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and how they compare to traditional metal oxide supports. The literature focuses on bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports, not on OMS catalysts or VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15.

1.在文献中没有找到与金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能,以及它们与传统金属氧化物载体的比较相关的引用。文献主要关注不同载体支持的双金属PtSn催化剂,而不是OMS催化剂或MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx。
