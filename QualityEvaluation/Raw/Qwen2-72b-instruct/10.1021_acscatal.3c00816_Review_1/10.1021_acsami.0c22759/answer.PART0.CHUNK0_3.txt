1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and how they compare to traditional metal oxide supports. The literature does not provide information on the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts in PDH reactions, nor does it discuss the influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
