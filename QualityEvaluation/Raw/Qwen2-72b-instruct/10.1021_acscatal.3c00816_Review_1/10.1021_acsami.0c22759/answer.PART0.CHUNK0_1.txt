1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature to answer the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and how they compare to traditional metal oxide supports in terms of structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. Additionally, there is no information on how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
