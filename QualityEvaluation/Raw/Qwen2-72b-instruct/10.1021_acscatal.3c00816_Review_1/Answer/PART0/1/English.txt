The nature and distribution of Cr species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) were studied. A series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDXS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr). Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction. In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state. Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites.

The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41, in both oxidized and reduced forms, showed superior time on-stream stability and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles. Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle. The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle. VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. The study aimed to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on long-term stability. Industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. Mechanistic origins governing catalysts' stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts have unique structural properties that can influence their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a significant role in the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 can affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is crucial for the superior performance of these catalysts, contributing to high conversion and selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The geometric effect is more significant than the electronic effect in contributing to dehydrogenation activity. The introduction of transition metals can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, enhancing electron interaction and improving dispersion. The addition of sulfur can promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The optimized catalysts can exhibit higher activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-time stability. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst shows remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, and traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does highlight that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show good onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the kind of VOx structures, with isolated VOx species showing higher intrinsic activity compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) is a common support in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, synthesized through a self-assembly process. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers advantages such as low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and improves resistance to coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in PDH reactions, demonstrating high propylene productivity but also experiencing rapid deactivation. The initial presence of CO in reactions over as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts suggests the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the PDH reaction, which can be eliminated by H2 pretreatment. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior stability compared to their prereduced counterparts, indicating that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. Depletion of lattice oxygen is a significant factor in catalyst deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction. In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state. Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites.

The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41, in both oxidized and reduced forms, showed superior time on-stream stability and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles. Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle. The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle. VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. The study aimed to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on long-term stability. Industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. Mechanistic origins governing catalysts' stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts have unique structural properties that can influence their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a significant role in the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 can affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is crucial for the superior performance of these catalysts, contributing to high conversion and selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The geometric effect is more significant than the electronic effect in contributing to dehydrogenation activity. The introduction of transition metals can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, enhancing electron interaction and improving dispersion. The addition of sulfur can promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The optimized catalysts can exhibit higher activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-time stability. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst shows remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, and traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does highlight that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show good onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the kind of VOx structures, with isolated VOx species showing higher intrinsic activity compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) is a common support in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, synthesized through a self-assembly process. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers advantages such as low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and improves resistance to coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in PDH reactions, demonstrating high propylene productivity but also experiencing rapid deactivation. The initial presence of CO in reactions over as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts suggests the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the PDH reaction, which can be eliminated by H2 pretreatment. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior stability compared to their prereduced counterparts, indicating that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. Depletion of lattice oxygen is a significant factor in catalyst deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

The nature and distribution of Cr species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) were studied. A series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDXS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr).
