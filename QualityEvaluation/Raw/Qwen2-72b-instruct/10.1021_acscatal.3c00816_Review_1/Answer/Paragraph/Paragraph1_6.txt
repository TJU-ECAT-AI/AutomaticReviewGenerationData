                    The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges. In Cr-catalyzed PDH, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites with a coordination number greater than four in xCrSBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species show the highest activity and selectivity, indicating their importance in the reaction mechanism. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrated superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity from cycle to cycle \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged over four DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated. H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst properties, and in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy revealed carbon deposits as the main deactivation cause in a single DH cycle. Structural changes in metal/metal oxide species led to activity loss in CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over cycles. The study aimed to explore VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2, focusing on long-term stability, and compared it with industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of lattice oxygen species and the development of novel H2 pretreatment strategies to enhance catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. The investigation of isolated and oligomeric Cr species in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3, respectively, could lead to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts. The exploration of geometric effects over electronic effects in dehydrogenation activity could provide insights into the role of transition metals in improving catalytic performance. The development of Zn anchoring sites and sulfur addition strategies could enhance electron interaction and dispersion, promoting C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. Na-doping could regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The optimization of catalysts, such as the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst, could achieve high activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-term stability.

                    金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用、结构和性能: MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的比较分析,它们的优势、反应机制和挑战。在Cr催化PDH中,xCrSBA-15催化剂(1 wt% Cr)的孤立Cr物种比以结晶α-Cr2O3粒子(5 wt% Cr)为主的催化剂每摩尔Cr具有更高的活性和选择性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]。xCrSBA-15中具有大于四的配位数的孤立Cr(III)位点比结晶Cr2O3表面的Cr位点更活跃、更选择性、更稳定。相比之下,对于xCrAl2O3,寡聚Cr物种显示出最高的活性和选择性,表明它们在反应机制中的重要性。活性Cr位点在反应过程中现场生成,通常处于(III)氧化态。VOx/MCM-41在氧化再生中表现出优越的稳定性和活性恢复,与CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3不同,后者从循环到循环失去活性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]。MCM-41上的VOx物种在四个DH循环中保持不变,而CrOx聚集。H2预处理影响催化剂性能,原位UV/Vis光谱显示单个DH循环中碳沉积是主要的失活原因。金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化导致CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在循环中失去活性。该研究旨在探索VOx/MCM-41在无气相O2的PDH反应中的潜力,重点是长期稳定性,并与工业相关的Cr-和PtSn基催化剂进行比较。
