In PDH reactions, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites with a coordination number greater than four in xCrSBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 show the highest activity and selectivity, indicating their crucial role in the reaction. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrated superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity due to structural changes in active species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged over cycles, while CrOx aggregated. H2 pretreatment influenced DH properties, and in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation elucidated deactivation mechanisms, mainly carbon deposits for VOx/MCM-41 and structural changes for the others. The study aimed to assess VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH with a focus on long-term stability, comparing it with industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts.

The application of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has garnered significant attention due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. These catalysts exhibit superior performance over traditional metal oxide supports, with isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrating higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\].

Unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior stability and fully recoverable activity through oxidative regeneration, with VOx species remaining unchanged over four DH cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Deactivation was primarily due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\].

                    The literature lacks specific insights into how lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment affect catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022\]. However, it is known that lattice oxygen species participate in PDH, detectable as CO, and are eliminated by H2 pretreatment \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_1\]. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 outperform prereduced versions in propylene productivity but have lower stability, with oxidized species more active than reduced ones \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_1\].

Surface OH on Al2O3 affects VOx species and its interaction with the support \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is critical for high conversion and selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Geometric effects are more significant than electronic effects in dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Transition metals improve catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure of Pt atoms \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Zn anchoring enhances electron interaction and improves dispersion \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Sulfur addition promotes C3H6 desorption and anti-coking \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Na-doping regulates interactions between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Optimized catalysts achieve high activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-term stability \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\].

Na-doping could regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The optimization of catalysts, such as the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst, could achieve high activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-term stability.

The application of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has garnered significant attention due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. These catalysts exhibit superior performance over traditional metal oxide supports, with isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrating higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species show the highest activity and selectivity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. VOx/MCM-41 has shown superior stability and recoverable activity through oxidative regeneration, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity from cycle to cycle \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged over four DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Carbon deposits were identified as the main deactivation cause in a single cycle, while structural changes in CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 led to activity loss over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. H2 pretreatment effects and catalyst deactivation mechanisms were elucidated using in situ UV/Vis and temperature-programmed oxidation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. The study aimed to assess VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH without gas-phase O2, focusing on long-term stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\].

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in the application of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have opened new avenues for exploration. Future research might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to enhance the dispersion of active sites and improve the stability of these catalysts under PDH conditions. The role of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in catalyst performance and deactivation remains a critical area for further investigation. Developing a deeper understanding of these factors could lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. Additionally, the exploration of novel metal-ordered mesoporous materials with tailored properties for PDH could potentially revolutionize the field, offering improved selectivity and activity.

The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges. Studies have revealed that xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation, exhibit differing performances in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr species in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrate higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species show the highest activity. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. VOx/MCM-41 has been shown to display superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lose activity over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remain unchanged, ensuring stable performance, while CrOx aggregates. Deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles. H2 pretreatment influences catalyst properties, and VOx/MCM-41 shows the least deactivation over four cycles, with activity fully restored after each cycle.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of OMS catalysts by fine-tuning the coordination number of Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 and the oligomeric state of Cr species in xCrAl2O3 to achieve higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The role of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions remain areas for further investigation. Developing strategies to mitigate carbon deposition and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species could enhance the long-term stability of VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The exploration of novel pretreatment methods and the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation mechanisms could lead to significant breakthroughs in PDH catalysis.
