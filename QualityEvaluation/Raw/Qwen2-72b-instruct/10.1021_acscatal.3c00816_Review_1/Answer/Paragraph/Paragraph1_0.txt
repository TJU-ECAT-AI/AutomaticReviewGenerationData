                    In PDH reactions, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites with a coordination number greater than four in xCrSBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 show the highest activity and selectivity, indicating their crucial role in the reaction. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrated superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity due to structural changes in active species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged over cycles, while CrOx aggregated. H2 pretreatment influenced DH properties, and in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation elucidated deactivation mechanisms, mainly carbon deposits for VOx/MCM-41 and structural changes for the others. The study aimed to assess VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH with a focus on long-term stability, comparing it with industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of lattice oxygen species and the development of novel H2 pretreatment strategies to enhance catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. The investigation of the SMSI effect and its influence on the electronic structure of active sites could lead to the design of more efficient catalysts. Moreover, the exploration of geometric effects and their impact on dehydrogenation activity could open new avenues for catalyst improvement. The integration of transition metals and the optimization of their electronic structure could significantly enhance catalytic performance. The development of sulfur addition strategies to promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability could also be a promising direction. Na-doping and its role in regulating the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, reducing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation, could be further investigated. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst's high propane conversion and propylene selectivity could serve as a benchmark for future catalyst development.

                    在PDH反应中，xCrSBA-15催化剂中孤立的Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）每摩尔Cr的活性和选择性高于以结晶α-Cr2O3（5 wt% Cr）为主的催化剂\[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]。xCrSBA-15中配位数大于四的孤立Cr(III)位点比结晶Cr2O3表面的Cr位点更活跃、更具选择性和稳定性。相反，xCrAl2O3中的寡聚Cr物种显示出最高的活性和选择性，表明它们在反应中的关键作用。活性Cr位点在反应过程中现场生成，通常处于(III)氧化态。VOx/MCM-41通过氧化再生展示了优越的稳定性和活性恢复，与CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3不同，后两者由于活性物种的结构变化而失去活性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]。MCM-41上的VOx物种在循环中保持不变，而CrOx聚集。H2预处理影响了DH性质，原位UV/Vis光谱和温度程序氧化揭示了失活机制，主要是VOx/MCM-41的碳沉积和其他催化剂的结构变化。该研究旨在评估VOx/MCM-41在PDH反应中的潜力，重点是长期稳定性，将其与工业相关的Cr-和PtSn基催化剂进行比较。
