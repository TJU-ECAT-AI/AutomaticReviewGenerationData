                    The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges. Studies have revealed that xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation, exhibit differing performances in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr species in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrate higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species show the highest activity. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. VOx/MCM-41 has been shown to display superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lose activity over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remain unchanged, ensuring stable performance, while CrOx aggregates. Deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles. H2 pretreatment influences catalyst properties, and VOx/MCM-41 shows the least deactivation over four cycles, with activity fully restored after each cycle.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of OMS catalysts by fine-tuning the coordination number of Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 and the oligomeric state of Cr species in xCrAl2O3 to achieve higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The role of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions remain areas for further investigation. Developing strategies to mitigate carbon deposition and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species could enhance the long-term stability of VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The exploration of novel pretreatment methods and the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation mechanisms could lead to significant breakthroughs in PDH catalysis.

                    金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用、结构和性能: MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的比较分析,它们的优势、反应机制和挑战。研究表明,xCrSBA-15和xCrAl2O3催化剂,通过浸渍制备,在PDH反应中表现出不同的性能\[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]。xCrSBA-15(1 wt% Cr)中的孤立Cr物种显示出比由结晶α-Cr2O3颗粒(5 wt% Cr)主导的物种更高的活性和选择性。在xCrAl2O3中,具有寡聚物种的催化剂显示出最高的活性。原位XAS研究表明,在反应过程中生成的活性Cr位点通常处于(III)氧化态。xCrSBA-15中具有大于四的配位数的孤立Cr(III)位点比结晶Cr2O3表面上的Cr位点更活跃、更有选择性和更稳定。相比之下,xCrAl2O3中的寡聚Cr物种比孤立Cr位点更活跃和更有选择性。在非氧化性丙烷脱氢中,VOx/MCM-41显示出通过氧化再生恢复的优越稳定性和活性,与CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3不同,后者在循环中失去活性\[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]。MCM-41上的VOx物种保持不变,确保稳定性能,而CrOx聚集。失活主要是由于单个循环中的碳沉积和金属/金属氧化物物种在循环中的结构变化。H2预处理影响催化剂性能,VOx/MCM-41在四个循环中显示出最少的失活,每个循环后活性完全恢复。
