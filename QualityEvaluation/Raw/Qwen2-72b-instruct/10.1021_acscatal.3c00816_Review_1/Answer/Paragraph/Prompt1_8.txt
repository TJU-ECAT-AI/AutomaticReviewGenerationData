{"DOC": "A study on Cr species in PDH catalysts revealed that xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation, show differing performances. Isolated Cr species in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species show the highest activity. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state.
