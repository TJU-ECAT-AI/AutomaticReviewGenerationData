The application of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has garnered significant attention due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. These catalysts exhibit superior performance over traditional metal oxide supports, with isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrating higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline Î±-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\].

                    VOx/MCM-41 catalysts have shown notable onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions, with isolated VOx species demonstrating superior intrinsic activity over oligomerized forms \[10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022\]. Unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior stability and fully recoverable activity through oxidative regeneration, with VOx species remaining unchanged over four DH cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Deactivation was primarily due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\].

                    The literature lacks specific insights into how lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment affect catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022\]. However, it is known that lattice oxygen species participate in PDH, detectable as CO, and are eliminated by H2 pretreatment \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_1\]. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 outperform prereduced versions in propylene productivity but have lower stability, with oxidized species more active than reduced ones \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_1\]. Deactivation is linked to lattice oxygen depletion \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_1\].

                    Surface acidity significantly influences coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coke \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Surface OH on Al2O3 affects VOx species and its interaction with the support \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is critical for high conversion and selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Geometric effects are more significant than electronic effects in dehydrogenation activity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Transition metals improve catalytic performance by altering the electronic structure of Pt atoms \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Zn anchoring enhances electron interaction and improves dispersion \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Sulfur addition promotes C3H6 desorption and anti-coking \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Na-doping regulates interactions between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Optimized catalysts achieve high activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-term stability \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\].

                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel OMS catalysts with enhanced stability and activity, particularly in the context of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment effects. The optimization of surface acidity and geometric effects could lead to the design of catalysts with superior anti-coking properties and selectivity. Additionally, the exploration of transition metals and their impact on the electronic structure of active sites could open new avenues for improving catalytic performance. The integration of Zn anchoring, sulfur addition, and Na-doping strategies could further enhance dispersion, anti-coking ability, and selectivity. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst's high propane conversion and propylene selectivity suggest potential for further optimization and scale-up studies.

VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged over four DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Carbon deposits were identified as the main deactivation cause in a single cycle, while structural changes in CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 led to activity loss over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. H2 pretreatment effects and catalyst deactivation mechanisms were elucidated using in situ UV/Vis and temperature-programmed oxidation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. The study aimed to assess VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH without gas-phase O2, focusing on long-term stability \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in the application of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have opened new avenues for exploration. Future research might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods to enhance the dispersion of active sites and improve the stability of these catalysts under PDH conditions. The role of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in catalyst performance and deactivation remains a critical area for further investigation. Developing a deeper understanding of these factors could lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. Additionally, the exploration of novel metal-ordered mesoporous materials with tailored properties for PDH could potentially revolutionize the field, offering improved selectivity and activity.
