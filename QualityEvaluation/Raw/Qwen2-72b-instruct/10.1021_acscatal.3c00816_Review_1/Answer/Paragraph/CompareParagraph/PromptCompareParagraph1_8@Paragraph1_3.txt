The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges. Studies have revealed that xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation, exhibit differing performances in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr species in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrate higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species show the highest activity. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. VOx/MCM-41 has been shown to display superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lose activity over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remain unchanged, ensuring stable performance, while CrOx aggregates. Deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles. H2 pretreatment influences catalyst properties, and VOx/MCM-41 shows the least deactivation over four cycles, with activity fully restored after each cycle.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of OMS catalysts by fine-tuning the coordination number of Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 and the oligomeric state of Cr species in xCrAl2O3 to achieve higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The role of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions remain areas for further investigation. Developing strategies to mitigate carbon deposition and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species could enhance the long-term stability of VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The exploration of novel pretreatment methods and the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation mechanisms could lead to significant breakthroughs in PDH catalysis.

In PDH reactions, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites with a coordination number greater than four in xCrSBA-15 are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state.

                    VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior stability and recoverable activity through oxidative regeneration in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lose activity over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remain unchanged, while CrOx aggregates. Deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in CrOx and PtSn/Al2O3 over cycles. H2 pretreatment influences catalyst properties.

                    OMS catalysts like MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx exhibit unique properties affecting catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxides \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Surface acidity correlates with coke formation, where higher acidity increases coke tendency. Surface OH on Al2O3 impacts VOx species' polymeric degree and interaction. The SMSI effect between support and active center is pivotal for high conversion and selectivity. Metal migration prevention and sintering agglomeration enhance stability. Geometric effects are more significant than electronic effects for dehydrogenation activity. Transition metals modify Pt atoms' electronic structure, improving performance. Zn anchoring sites constrain Pt, enhancing electron interaction and dispersion. Sulfur addition promotes C3H6 desorption and anti-coking. Na-doping regulates Brnsted sites and Cr components, reducing propane adsorption and CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst demonstrates high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

                    VOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit good onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions, with isolated VOx species showing higher intrinsic activity than oligomerized ones \[10.1016/j.jcat.2017.05.022\]. The literature lacks specific discussion on the impact of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

                    OMS, synthesized via self-assembly, supports VOx and CrOx in PDH reactions, offering low acidity, high surface area, and ordered pores, enhancing reactive site dispersion and anti-coking \[10.1021/acscatal.3c00816\_1\]. VOx and CrOx on MCM-41 and SBA-15 show high propylene yields but quick deactivation. Lattice oxygen species participate in PDH, eliminated by H2 pretreatment. As-prepared catalysts yield more propylene but are less stable, with oxidized species more active than reduced ones. VOx/MCM-41 outperforms CrOx/MCM-41, achieving 0.2 kgC3H6/kgcat/h and 90% propylene selectivity.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel OMS catalysts with tailored surface properties to further enhance catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions. The optimization of lattice oxygen species and the investigation of H2 pretreatment effects on catalyst deactivation mechanisms could lead to the design of more robust and efficient catalysts. Additionally, the exploration of transition metals and their impact on Pt atoms' electronic structure offers a promising avenue for improving catalytic activity. The integration of these findings into the design of next-generation PDH catalysts could potentially revolutionize the industry by achieving higher conversion rates and selectivity while minimizing deactivation and coke formation.
