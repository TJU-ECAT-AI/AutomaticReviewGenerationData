In PDH reactions, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrated superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration over four DH cycles, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged, while CrOx aggregated. H2 pretreatment influenced DH properties. Deactivation was mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in active species over cycles. The study aimed to explore VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH with a focus on long-term stability, comparing it to industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel OMS catalysts with optimized lattice oxygen species and enhanced H2 pretreatment strategies to mitigate deactivation in PDH reactions. The exploration of alternative metal species and the fine-tuning of their distribution on mesoporous supports could lead to the discovery of catalysts with superior stability and selectivity. Additionally, the integration of in situ spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the role of active sites in PDH, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions: A comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, their advantages, reaction mechanisms, and challenges. Studies have revealed that xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by impregnation, exhibit differing performances in PDH reactions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr species in xCrSBA-15 (1 wt% Cr) demonstrate higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). In xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species show the highest activity. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with a coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on crystalline Cr2O3 surfaces. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species in xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. VOx/MCM-41 has been shown to display superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lose activity over cycles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remain unchanged, ensuring stable performance, while CrOx aggregates. Deactivation is mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species over cycles. H2 pretreatment influences catalyst properties, and VOx/MCM-41 shows the least deactivation over four cycles, with activity fully restored after each cycle.
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of OMS catalysts by fine-tuning the coordination number of Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 and the oligomeric state of Cr species in xCrAl2O3 to achieve higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The role of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions remain areas for further investigation. Developing strategies to mitigate carbon deposition and structural changes in metal/metal oxide species could enhance the long-term stability of VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts. The exploration of novel pretreatment methods and the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to deactivation mechanisms could lead to significant breakthroughs in PDH catalysis.
