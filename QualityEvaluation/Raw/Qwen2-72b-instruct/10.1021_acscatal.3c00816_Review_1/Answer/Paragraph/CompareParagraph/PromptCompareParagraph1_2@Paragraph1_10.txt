The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions have been extensively studied, particularly focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. These catalysts exhibit superior performance due to their unique structural properties, such as low surface acidity, high surface area, and ordered pores, which enhance reactive site dispersion and anti-coking \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a critical role in coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coke \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Surface OH content on Al2O3 affects the polymeric degree of VOx species and its interaction with the support \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is essential for high conversion and selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Transition metals can optimize the electronic structure of Pt atoms, improving catalytic performance \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Zn anchoring sites enhance electron interaction and improve dispersion \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Sulfur addition promotes C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. Na-doping regulates the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst showcases remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity \[10.1039/D2NR02208G\]. In non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, VOx/MCM-41 showed superior stability over four DH cycles, with activity fully recoverable by oxidative regeneration \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Its VOx species remained unchanged, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity due to structural changes in active species \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Deactivation in a single cycle was mainly due to carbon deposits, while cycle-to-cycle activity loss was caused by metal/metal oxide species alterations \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. H2 pretreatment effects on DH properties were explored, revealing that VOx/MCM-41's stability is attributed to unchanged VOx species over cycles, contrasting with CrOx aggregation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in the application of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, have opened new avenues for exploration. The unique structural properties of these catalysts, such as low surface acidity, high surface area, and ordered pores, have been shown to enhance reactive site dispersion and anti-coking, leading to superior performance in PDH reactions. Future research efforts might focus on further optimizing the electronic structure of Pt atoms through the introduction of transition metals, enhancing electron interaction and dispersion through Zn anchoring sites, and promoting C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability through sulfur addition. Additionally, the regulation of interactions between Brnsted sites and Cr components through Na-doping could be explored to decrease propane adsorption and inhibit CH bond activation. The study of the effects of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions remains a critical area for future investigation, as it could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically those supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, have garnered significant attention in the field of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structure and performance. These catalysts, often impregnated with metal oxides such as VOx and CrOx, exhibit high activity and selectivity in converting propane to propylene. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports provide a highly ordered mesoporous structure that facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing the deactivation of the active sites. VOx catalysts are particularly advantageous due to their redox properties, which enable a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where oxygen is transferred from the catalyst to the reactant. In contrast, CrOx catalysts operate via a different mechanism, involving the formation of Cr(III)-alkyl intermediates. Despite their benefits, these catalysts face challenges such as thermal stability and the need for regeneration, which are critical for their long-term operation in industrial PDH processes. The comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts reveals that while both have high initial activity, SBA-15-supported catalysts often exhibit better stability and higher propylene yields over extended reaction times. This comparative study highlights the importance of the support structure in influencing the performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions.
