                    In PDH reactions, xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity per mole of Cr than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr) \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]. Isolated Cr(III) sites in xCrSBA-15 with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. Active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrated superior stability and activity recovery through oxidative regeneration over four DH cycles, unlike CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, which lost activity \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged, while CrOx aggregated. H2 pretreatment influenced DH properties. Deactivation was mainly due to carbon deposits in a single cycle and structural changes in active species over cycles. The study aimed to explore VOx/MCM-41's potential for PDH with a focus on long-term stability, comparing it to industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts.

                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel OMS catalysts with optimized lattice oxygen species and enhanced H2 pretreatment strategies to mitigate deactivation in PDH reactions. The exploration of alternative metal species and the fine-tuning of their distribution on mesoporous supports could lead to the discovery of catalysts with superior stability and selectivity. Additionally, the integration of in situ spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the role of active sites in PDH, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

                    在PDH反应中，xCrSBA-15催化剂中孤立的Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）每摩尔Cr的活性和选择性高于以结晶α-Cr2O3颗粒（5 wt% Cr）为主的催化剂\[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014\]。xCrSBA-15中配位数大于四的孤立Cr(III)位点比结晶Cr2O3表面的Cr位点更活跃、更选择性、更稳定。相比之下，对于xCrAl2O3，寡聚Cr物种比孤立Cr位点更活跃和选择性。活性Cr位点在反应过程中生成，通常处于(III)氧化态。VOx/MCM-41在四个DH循环中通过氧化再生展示了优越的稳定性和活性恢复，与失去活性的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3不同\[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]。MCM-41上的VOx物种保持不变，而CrOx聚集。H2预处理影响了DH性质。失活主要是由于单个循环中的碳沉积和活性物种在循环中的结构变化。该研究旨在探索VOx/MCM-41在PDH中的潜力，重点是长期稳定性，与工业相关的Cr-和PtSn基催化剂进行比较。
