{"DOC": "A study on Cr-catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) revealed that xCrSBA-15 catalysts with isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). Isolated Cr species on xCrSBA-15 are more active than those on γ-Al2O3. Oligomeric species in xCrAl2O3 show the highest activity, highlighting their importance in the reaction. In situ XAS studies indicate that active Cr sites are generated during the reaction, typically in the (III) oxidation state. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.
