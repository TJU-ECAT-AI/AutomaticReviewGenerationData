Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically those supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, have garnered significant attention in the field of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structure and performance. These catalysts, often impregnated with metal oxides such as VOx and CrOx, exhibit high activity and selectivity in converting propane to propylene. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports provide a highly ordered mesoporous structure that facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, minimizing the deactivation of the active sites. VOx catalysts are particularly advantageous due to their redox properties, which enable a Mars-van Krevelen-type mechanism, where oxygen is transferred from the catalyst to the reactant. In contrast, CrOx catalysts operate via a different mechanism, involving the formation of Cr(III)-alkyl intermediates. Despite their benefits, these catalysts face challenges such as thermal stability and the need for regeneration, which are critical for their long-term operation in industrial PDH processes. The comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts reveals that while both have high initial activity, SBA-15-supported catalysts often exhibit better stability and higher propylene yields over extended reaction times. This comparative study highlights the importance of the support structure in influencing the performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions.
