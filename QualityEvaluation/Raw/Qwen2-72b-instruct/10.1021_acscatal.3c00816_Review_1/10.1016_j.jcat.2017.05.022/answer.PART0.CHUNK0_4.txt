1.The literature does not provide direct comparisons between Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, and traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss the performance of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. The catalysts with isolated VOx species show higher intrinsic activity and resistance against deactivation compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

1.文献没有直接比较金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx,与传统金属氧化物载体在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。但是,它确实讨论了VOx/MCM-41催化剂在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢中的性能。具有孤立VOx物种的催化剂显示出比其寡聚化对应物更高的内在活性和抗失活性。文献没有特别讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
