1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, and traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does highlight that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show good onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the kind of VOx structures, with isolated VOx species showing higher intrinsic activity compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not specifically discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

1.文献没有直接比较金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统金属氧化物载体在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，它确实强调VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出良好的在线稳定性并具有高选择性。这些催化剂的性能受VOx结构类型的影响，其中孤立的VOx物种表现出比它们的寡聚物更高的内在活性。文献没有特别讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。
