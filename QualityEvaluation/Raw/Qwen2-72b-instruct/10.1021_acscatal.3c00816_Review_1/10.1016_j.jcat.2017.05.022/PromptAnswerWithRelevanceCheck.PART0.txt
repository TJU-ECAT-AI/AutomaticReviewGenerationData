Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

1.The literature does not provide a direct comparison between Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, and traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does highlight that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show good onstream stability and high selectivity in PDH reactions. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the kind of VOx structures, with isolated VOx species being more active and resistant against deactivation compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not discuss the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

1.文献没有直接比较金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统的金属氧化物载体在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。然而，它确实强调VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中显示出良好的在线稳定性并具有高选择性。这些催化剂的性能受VOx结构类型的影响，与它们的寡聚化对应物相比，孤立的VOx物种更活跃且更抗失活。文献没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响。

However, it does discuss the performance of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. The catalysts with isolated VOx species showed higher intrinsic activity and resistance against deactivation compared to their oligomerized counterparts. The literature does not specifically address the influence of lattice oxygen species or H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
