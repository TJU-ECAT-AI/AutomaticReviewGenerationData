[1] "Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles."
[2] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."
[3] "In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."

1.The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles. VOx/MCM-41 showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles, and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species.

1.比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的催化性能，这些催化剂在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中进行了比较。VOx/MCM-41在所有DH周期中都显示出优越的在线时间稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。在DH/再生周期中，MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构没有改变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。还研究了H2还原对催化剂DH性能的影响。使用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱和使用过的催化剂的温度编程氧化，使我们能够阐明催化剂失活的起源。在一个DH周期中，碳沉积的形成是失活的主要原因。CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3从周期到周期的活性损失是由催化活性金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化引起的。
