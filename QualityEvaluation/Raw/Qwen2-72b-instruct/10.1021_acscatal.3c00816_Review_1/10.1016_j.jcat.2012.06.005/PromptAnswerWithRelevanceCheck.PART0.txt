Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

[1] "Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles."
[2] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."
[3] "In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."
[4] "The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts DH properties was also investigated."

1.比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的催化性能，这些催化剂在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中进行了比较。VOx/MCM-41在所有DH周期中都显示出优越的在线时间稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。在DH/再生周期中，MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构没有改变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。还研究了H2还原对催化剂DH性能的影响。使用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱和使用过的催化剂的温度编程氧化，使我们能够阐明催化剂失活的起源。在一个DH周期中，碳沉积的形成是失活的主要原因。CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3从周期到周期的活性损失是由催化活性金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化引起的。

1.在非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应中，比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中的催化性能。VOx/MCM-41在氧化和还原形式下均表现出优异的在线稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。在DH/再生周期中，MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构保持不变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。VOx/MCM-41在四个24小时DH周期中表现出最低的失活。氧化再生在每个DH周期后完全恢复了VOx/MCM-41的活性。其他两种催化剂的活性从一个周期到另一个周期逐渐下降。VOx物种在4个DH周期中保持不变，而CrOx聚集。
