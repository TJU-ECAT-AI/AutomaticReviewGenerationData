          [1] "Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles."
          [2] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."
          [3] "In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."
          [4] "The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts DH properties was also investigated."
          [5] "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation."
          [6] "In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation."
          [7] "Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species."
          [8] "The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."
          [9] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
          [10] "For a comparative purpose, industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions."
          [11] "Mechanistic origins governing catalysts stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles."
          [12] "VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles."
          [13] "Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle."
          [14] "The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle."

          The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41, in both oxidized and reduced forms, showed superior time on-stream stability and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles. Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle. The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle. VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. The study aimed to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on long-term stability. Industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. Mechanistic origins governing catalysts' stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles.

          在非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应中，比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中的催化性能。VOx/MCM-41在氧化和还原形式下均表现出优异的在线稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。在DH/再生周期中，MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构保持不变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。VOx/MCM-41在四个24小时DH周期中表现出最低的失活。氧化再生在每个DH周期后完全恢复了VOx/MCM-41的活性。其他两种催化剂的活性从一个周期到另一个周期逐渐下降。VOx物种在4个DH周期中保持不变，而CrOx聚集。还研究了H2还原对催化剂DH性能的影响。使用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱和使用过的催化剂的温度编程氧化，使我们能够阐明催化剂失活的起源。在单个DH循环中，碳沉积的形成是失活的主要原因。CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3从循环到循环的活性损失是由催化活性金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化引起的。本研究的目的是探索在没有气相O2的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种在介孔SiO2(MCM-41)上的PDH潜力，特别关注长期稳定性。为了比较的目的，工业相关的Cr-和PtSn-基催化剂也在相同的反应条件下进行了研究。通过DH周期后催化剂的原位时间分辨UV/Vis分析和温度编程氧化，阐明了控制催化剂在单个DH周期内和多个DH-再生周期内稳定性的机制起源。
