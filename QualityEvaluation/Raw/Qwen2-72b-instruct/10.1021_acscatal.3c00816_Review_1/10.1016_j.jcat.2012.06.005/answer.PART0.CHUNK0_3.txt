[1] "Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles."
[2] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."
[3] "In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst."
[4] "VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles."
[5] "Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle."
[6] "The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle."
[7] "VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated."

1.The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41, in both oxidized and reduced forms, showed superior time on-stream stability and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 remained unchanged during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles. Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle. The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle. VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated.

1.在非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应中，比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中的催化性能。VOx/MCM-41在氧化和还原形式下均表现出优异的在线稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。在DH/再生周期中，MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构保持不变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。VOx/MCM-41在四个24小时DH周期中表现出最低的失活。氧化再生在每个DH周期后完全恢复了VOx/MCM-41的活性。其他两种催化剂的活性从一个周期到另一个周期逐渐下降。VOx物种在4个DH周期中保持不变，而CrOx聚集。
