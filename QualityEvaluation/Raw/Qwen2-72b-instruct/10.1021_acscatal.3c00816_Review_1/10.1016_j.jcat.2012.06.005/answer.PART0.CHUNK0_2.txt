1.The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles. VOx/MCM-41 showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles, and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of this catalyst. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. The study aimed to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on long-term stability. Industrially relevant Cr- and PtSn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. Mechanistic origins governing catalysts' stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles.

1.比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在非氧化性丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的催化性能，这些反应在四个DH周期和氧化再生周期中进行。VOx/MCM-41在所有DH周期中显示出优越的时间在线稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构在DH/再生周期中没有改变，这是该催化剂稳定性能的原因。还研究了H2还原对催化剂DH性能的影响。使用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱学和使用过的催化剂的温度编程氧化，使我们能够阐明催化剂失活的起源。在单个DH周期中，碳沉积的形成是失活的主要原因。CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3从周期到周期的活性损失是由催化活性金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化引起的。本研究的目的是探索在没有气相O2的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种在介孔SiO2(MCM-41)上的PDH潜力，特别关注长期稳定性。为了比较的目的，工业相关的Cr-和PtSn-基催化剂也在相同的反应条件下进行了研究。通过DH周期后催化剂的原位时间分辨UV/Vis分析和温度编程氧化，阐明了控制催化剂在单个DH周期内和多个DH-再生周期内稳定性的机制起源。
