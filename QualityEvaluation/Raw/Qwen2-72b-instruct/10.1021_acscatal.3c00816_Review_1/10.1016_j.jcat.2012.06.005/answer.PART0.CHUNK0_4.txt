1.The catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation was compared over four DH cycles and oxidative regeneration cycles. VOx/MCM-41 showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles, and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts' DH properties was also investigated. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled the elucidation of the origins of the catalysts' deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. The structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for the stable performance of VOx/MCM-41.

1.比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3在非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能，进行了四次DH循环和氧化再生循环。VOx/MCM-41在所有DH循环中表现出优越的在线稳定性，其活性可以通过氧化再生完全恢复。MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构在DH/再生循环中没有改变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。还研究了H2还原对催化剂DH性能的影响。使用原位时间分辨UV/Vis光谱和使用过的催化剂的温度编程氧化，使我们能够阐明催化剂失活的起源。在单个DH循环中，碳沉积的形成是失活的主要原因。CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3从循环到循环的活性损失是由催化活性金属/金属氧化物物种的结构变化引起的。MCM-41上活性VOx物种的结构在DH/再生循环中没有改变，这是VOx/MCM-41稳定性能的原因。
