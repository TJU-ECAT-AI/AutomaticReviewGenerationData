1.The document does not provide information on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It also does not compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discuss the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms, or explain how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
