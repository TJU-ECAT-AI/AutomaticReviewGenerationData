1. The document does not provide information on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. There is no comparison of their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, nor is there any discussion of the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is not addressed.
