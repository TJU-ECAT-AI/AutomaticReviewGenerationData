[1] "In addition to metallic promoters, metal oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide promoters could not only alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by the metaloxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71 For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by the strong metalsupport interaction between Pt and TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation. The induced metaloxide interaction and undesired acid sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[2] "Metal oxide supported Pt catalysts have been shown to be effective in PDH reactions. Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price. For instance, Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used. Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalyst due to its unsuitable support acidity. As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of attention."
[3] "Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.81 Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "In addition to oxide supports, some non-oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are applied. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable Pt3Ti intermetallic compounds prepared via reactive metalsupport interactions (RMSI) between platinum and MXenes.55 Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed."
[5] "An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2."
[6] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high toxicity. Therefore, low toxicity and stable alternative catalysts are increasingly desired."
[7] "In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 4). However, numerous V species exist on VOx-based catalysts, including V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5. Which V species are responsible for propane activation and selective propylene production is still unclear. In addition, the toxicity of VOx also limits their application in the industrial process."
[8] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided."

1.Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These supports provide a large surface area and tunable pore size, which can enhance the dispersion of metal particles and reduce coke deposition. The weak interaction between Pt and SiO2 allows the formation of Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees, such as PtM intermetallic alloys, by direct H2 pretreatment. In contrast, strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles can trap Pt atoms in the form of Pt ions, facilitating atomic redispersion of Pt clusters during regeneration without using corrosive halogens. The redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation can also eliminate coke deposition upon using water vapor. However, excessive addition of oxide promoters like TiO2 can increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to significant coke formation, which negatively affects the dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, the regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions. The performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts is summarized in Tables 2, 3, and 4. CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity but low stability, while VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For example, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can generate Zrcus cations, which increase the dehydrogenation activity of ZrO2-based catalysts. However, over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites.

1.金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx,已被研究用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。这些载体提供了大的表面积和可调的孔径,可以增强金属颗粒的分散并减少焦炭沉积。Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用允许通过直接H2预处理形成具有高合金度的Pt基双金属,如PtM金属间合金。相比之下,CeO2和金属颗粒之间的强相互作用可以将Pt原子以Pt离子的形式捕获,在再生过程中无需使用腐蚀性卤素即可促进Pt团簇的原子再分散。CeO2在丙烷脱氢下的氧化还原性质也可以通过使用水蒸气消除焦炭沉积。然而,过量添加TiO2等氧化物促进剂会增加强酸中心的数量,导致显著的焦炭形成,这会负面影响脱氢性能。因此,调节Pt和氧化物促进剂之间的相互作用对于PDH反应至关重要。MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的性能总结在表2、3和4中。CrOx基催化剂具有高反应性和选择性,但稳定性低,而VOx基催化剂与CrOx基催化剂相比具有高反应性和抑制的失活率。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。例如,掺杂和用还原气氛预处理可以生成Zrcus阳离子,从而增加ZrO2基催化剂的脱氢活性。然而,应谨慎避免过度还原,以防止氢重组位点的堵塞。

[5] "An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2. The comparison of the different catalysts is based on the propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Pt per hour at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction as a function of the deactivation rate."
[6] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide. At the beginning of the reaction, the carbon rapidly accumulates on the chromium oxide surface. As the reaction progresses, the reaction rate becomes slower, leading to a slower rate of coke formation. Therefore, industrial chromium-based catalysts need to be recycled frequently. In addition, due to the similar ionic radius of Al3+ and Cr3+, Cr3+ will diffuse into the Al2O3 lattice, leading to the formation of a spinel phase, and thus the loss of activity.93,94 At the same time, chrome oxide would collapse and aggregate during the redox cycles."
[7] "Similar to CrOx-based catalysts, carbon deposition is the main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is intimately related to the dispersion of VOx species.97 Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers found that regardless of supports for VOx-based catalysts, the coke deposition on VOx is more severe than that over the acid sites on supports.99,100 Additionally, there exists a positive relationship between the rate constant of coke formation and the polymerization degree of VOx species, where highly polymerized three-dimensional V2O5 nanoparticles (3D V2O5) result in more significant coke formation compared with low-polymerization-degree VOx species such as monovanadates and polyvanadates."

2. The deactivation of CrOx and VOx catalysts in PDH reactions is mainly due to carbon deposition and aggregation of Cr3+ or VOx species. Carbon rapidly accumulates on the surface of chromium oxide at the beginning of the reaction, leading to the need for frequent recycling of industrial chromium-based catalysts. Similarly, carbon deposition is the main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is closely related to the dispersion of VOx species. The rate constant of coke formation is positively related to the polymerization degree of VOx species, with highly polymerized three-dimensional V2O5 nanoparticles resulting in more significant coke formation compared to low-polymerization-degree VOx species. Factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For example, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can generate Zrcus cations, which have higher dehydrogenation activity. However, over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites and hinder the promoting effect of the metal.

2. CrOx和VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的失活主要是由于碳沉积和Cr3+或VOx物种的聚集。在反应开始时，碳迅速在铬氧化物表面积累，导致工业铬基催化剂需要频繁回收。类似地，碳沉积是VOx催化剂失活的主要原因，这与VOx物种的分散度密切相关。焦炭形成的速率常数与VOx物种的聚合度呈正相关，与低聚合度的VOx物种相比，高度聚合的三维V2O5纳米颗粒会导致更严重的焦炭形成。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。例如，掺杂和用还原气氛预处理可以生成具有更高脱氢活性的Zrcus阳离子。然而，过度还原应谨慎避免，以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，阻碍金属的促进作用。

Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.82 Additionally, Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and Pt@ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite) with some unique physical properties.43,83,84 The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and improving the catalytic stability."
[3] "In addition to oxide supports, some non-oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are applied. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable Pt3Ti intermetallic compounds prepared via reactive metalsupport interactions (RMSI) between platinum and MXenes.55 Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed. Zhen Zhao and coworkers found that graphene doped with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance.85 Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic and may exhibit a distinctive effect on the catalytic property. It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the component, morphology and distribution of metal particles but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance."
[4] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site.113 The promoting effect of the metal is therefore hindered. In addition, the bulk ZrO2 showed significant limitations of deactivation for carbon deposit in the dehydrogenation step and sintering in redox cycles. Therefore, the development of ZrO2-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been developed for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These supports have unique properties that can alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components, which can be mediated by metal-oxide interactions. The addition of titanium oxides can improve the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by enhancing the strong metal-support interaction between Pt and TiO2. However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，已被开发用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。这些载体具有独特的性质，可以改变金属组分的配位环境和电子状态，这可以通过金属-氧化物相互作用来调节。添加二氧化钛可以提高Pt催化剂的催化性能，通过增强Pt和TiO2之间的强金属-载体相互作用。然而，过量的TiO2添加可能会增加强酸中心的数量，导致大量焦炭的形成。Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用允许通过直接H2预处理在SiO2载体上形成具有高合金度的Pt基双金属，如PtM金属间合金。CeO2载体与金属颗粒有强烈的相互作用，其中Pt原子可以以Pt离子的形式被捕获。在再生步骤中，CeO2载体可以帮助促进Pt簇的原子再分散，而无需使用腐蚀性卤素。Pt也可以嵌入具有特殊三维通道的沸石中，如Pt@KA(LTA型沸石)和Pt@ZSM-5(MFI型沸石)，具有独特的物理性质。可调的Si/Al比和相对较大的表面积可以阻止大烃分子的形成，从而防止所谓的焦炭沉积，提高催化稳定性。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活。通过改变颗粒尺寸和晶相，Zrcus阳离子的浓度可以显著调节。掺杂和用还原气氛预处理可以是生成Zrcus阳离子的有效方法。虽然具有Zrcus的ZrO2显示出优异的脱氢活性，但应谨慎避免过度还原。

[1] "In addition to metallic promoters, metal oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide promoters could not only alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by the metaloxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71 For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by the strong metalsupport interaction between Pt and TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation. The induced metaloxide interaction and undesired acid sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[2] "The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3."
[3] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations.

[4] "DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts (2 eV versus 1.24 eV). Two Zrcus sites directly participate in alkane activation, while lattice oxygen and zirconium cations are required for CH bond activation on the stoichiometric surface.109"

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been employed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their high surface area and tunable pore size, which can enhance the dispersion of active metal particles and reduce coke formation. The metaloxide interactions in OMS catalysts can alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components, leading to improved catalytic performance. However, excessive oxide addition can increase the amount of strong acid centers, which may promote coke formation and negatively impact dehydrogenation performance. The reaction mechanisms of OMS catalysts involve the activation of propane molecules on the surface, where lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the activation of CH bonds. H2 pretreatment can also enhance the performance of OMS catalysts by promoting the formation of active sites and facilitating hydrogen desorption. However, over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites and hinder the promoting effect of the metal.
