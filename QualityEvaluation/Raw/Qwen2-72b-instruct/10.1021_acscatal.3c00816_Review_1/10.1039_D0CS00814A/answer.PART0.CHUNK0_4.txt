[1] "In addition to metallic promoters, metal oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide promoters could not only alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by the metaloxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71 For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by the strong metalsupport interaction between Pt and TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation. The induced metaloxide interaction and undesired acid sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[2] "The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3."
[3] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided."
[4] "DFT calculations predict that Zrcus cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with their saturated counterparts (2 eV versus 1.24 eV). Two Zrcus sites directly participate in alkane activation, while lattice oxygen and zirconium cations are required for CH bond activation on the stoichiometric surface.109"

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been employed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their high surface area and tunable pore size, which can enhance the dispersion of active metal particles and reduce coke formation. The metaloxide interactions in OMS catalysts can alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components, leading to improved catalytic performance. However, excessive oxide addition can increase the amount of strong acid centers, which may promote coke formation and negatively impact dehydrogenation performance. The reaction mechanisms of OMS catalysts involve the activation of propane molecules on the surface, where lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the activation of CH bonds. H2 pretreatment can also enhance the performance of OMS catalysts by promoting the formation of active sites and facilitating hydrogen desorption. However, over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites and hinder the promoting effect of the metal.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中得到了应用。这些催化剂与传统的金属氧化物支持相比具有优势，因为它们具有高比表面积和可调孔径，可以增强活性金属颗粒的分散，减少焦炭的形成。OMS催化剂中的金属氧化物相互作用可以改变金属组分的配位环境和电子状态，从而提高催化性能。然而，过量的氧化物添加会增加强酸中心的数量，这可能会促进焦炭的形成，对脱氢性能产生负面影响。OMS催化剂的反应机制涉及丙烷分子在表面的活化，其中晶格氧物种在CH键的活化中起着关键作用。H2预处理也可以通过促进活性位点的形成和促进氢的解吸来增强OMS催化剂的性能。然而，过度还原应谨慎避免，以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，阻碍金属的促进作用。
