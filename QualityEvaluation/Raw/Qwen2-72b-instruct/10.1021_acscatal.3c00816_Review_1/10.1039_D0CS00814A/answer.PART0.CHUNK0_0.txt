[1] "In addition to metallic promoters, metal oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide promoters could not only alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by the metaloxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71 For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by the strong metalsupport interaction between Pt and TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation. The induced metaloxide interaction and undesired acid sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[2] "Metal oxide supported Pt catalysts have been shown to be effective in PDH reactions. Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price. For instance, Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used. Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalyst due to its unsuitable support acidity. As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of attention."
[3] "Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.81 Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "In addition to oxide supports, some non-oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are applied. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable Pt3Ti intermetallic compounds prepared via reactive metalsupport interactions (RMSI) between platinum and MXenes.55 Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed."
[5] "An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2."
[6] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high toxicity. Therefore, low toxicity and stable alternative catalysts are increasingly desired."
[7] "In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 4). However, numerous V species exist on VOx-based catalysts, including V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5. Which V species are responsible for propane activation and selective propylene production is still unclear. In addition, the toxicity of VOx also limits their application in the industrial process."
[8] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided."

1.Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These supports provide a large surface area and tunable pore size, which can enhance the dispersion of metal particles and reduce coke deposition. The weak interaction between Pt and SiO2 allows the formation of Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees, such as PtM intermetallic alloys, by direct H2 pretreatment. In contrast, strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles can trap Pt atoms in the form of Pt ions, facilitating atomic redispersion of Pt clusters during regeneration without using corrosive halogens. The redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation can also eliminate coke deposition upon using water vapor. However, excessive addition of oxide promoters like TiO2 can increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to significant coke formation, which negatively affects the dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, the regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions. The performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts is summarized in Tables 2, 3, and 4. CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity but low stability, while VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For example, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can generate Zrcus cations, which increase the dehydrogenation activity of ZrO2-based catalysts. However, over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites.

1.金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx,已被研究用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。这些载体提供了大的表面积和可调的孔径,可以增强金属颗粒的分散并减少焦炭沉积。Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用允许通过直接H2预处理形成具有高合金度的Pt基双金属,如PtM金属间合金。相比之下,CeO2和金属颗粒之间的强相互作用可以将Pt原子以Pt离子的形式捕获,在再生过程中无需使用腐蚀性卤素即可促进Pt团簇的原子再分散。CeO2在丙烷脱氢下的氧化还原性质也可以通过使用水蒸气消除焦炭沉积。然而,过量添加TiO2等氧化物促进剂会增加强酸中心的数量,导致显著的焦炭形成,这会负面影响脱氢性能。因此,调节Pt和氧化物促进剂之间的相互作用对于PDH反应至关重要。MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的性能总结在表2、3和4中。CrOx基催化剂具有高反应性和选择性,但稳定性低,而VOx基催化剂与CrOx基催化剂相比具有高反应性和抑制的失活率。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。例如,掺杂和用还原气氛预处理可以生成Zrcus阳离子,从而增加ZrO2基催化剂的脱氢活性。然而,应谨慎避免过度还原,以防止氢重组位点的堵塞。
