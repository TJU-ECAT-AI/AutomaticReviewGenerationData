1.No relevant quotes were found in the provided literature that specifically analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature does not compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, nor does it discuss the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts in PDH reactions. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also not addressed in the provided text.
