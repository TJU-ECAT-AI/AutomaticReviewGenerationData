[1] "In addition to metallic promoters, metal oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide promoters could not only alter the coordination environment and electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by the metaloxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71 For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts by the strong metalsupport interaction between Pt and TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke formation. The induced metaloxide interaction and undesired acid sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions."
[2] "Metal oxide supported Pt catalysts have been shown to be effective in PDH reactions. Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price. For instance, Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used. Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory, especially regarding the stability of the catalyst due to its unsuitable support acidity. As a consequence, during the process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of attention."
[3] "Due to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.81 Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2 and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using corrosive halogens. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "In addition to oxide supports, some non-oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are applied. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides, i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable compositions have attracted much attention. Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally stable Pt3Ti intermetallic compounds prepared via reactive metalsupport interactions (RMSI) between platinum and MXenes.55 Additionally, carbon materials have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually developed."
[5] "An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions, propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2. The comparison of the different catalysts is based on the propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Pt per hour at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction as a function of the deactivation rate."
[6] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high toxicity. Therefore, low toxicity and stable alternative catalysts are increasingly desired."
[7] "In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 4). However, numerous V species exist on VOx-based catalysts, including V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5. Which V species are responsible for propane activation and selective propylene production is still unclear. In addition, the toxicity of VOx also limits their application in the industrial process."
[8] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided."
[9] "In addition to CrOx-, VOx-, GaOx- and ZrOx-based oxide catalysts, InOx-based (Table 7), ZnO-based (Table 8), MoOx-based (Table 9) Fe-based (Table 10), Co-based (Table 11) catalysts and so forth have been studied. However, the activity and propylene selectivity need to be further improved. Most importantly, the catalyst stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes should be extensively promoted."

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been used in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials have large surface areas and tunable pore structures, which can enhance the dispersion of metal oxides and improve the accessibility of reactants to active sites. The weak interaction between Pt and SiO2 allows the formation of Pt-based bimetals with high alloying degrees, such as PtM intermetallic alloys, by direct H2 pretreatment. This can lead to improved catalytic performance and stability. However, excessive addition of oxide promoters like TiO2 can increase the amount of strong acid centers, leading to significant coke formation and deactivation. The use of modified Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted attention to improve the stability of the catalysts. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment can promote the formation of active species like GaH, which are more active than H+ sites and Ga+ sites. Over-reduction should be carefully avoided to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites and hinder the promoting effect of metals like Rh. The stability of the catalysts during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes needs to be extensively promoted.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中得到了应用。这些材料具有大表面积和可调孔结构，可以增强金属氧化物的分散性，提高反应物对活性位点的可及性。Pt和SiO2之间的弱相互作用允许通过直接H2预处理形成高合金度的Pt基双金属，如PtM金属间合金，这可以提高催化性能和稳定性。然而，过量添加TiO2等氧化物促进剂会增加强酸中心的数量，导致大量焦炭形成和失活。为了提高催化剂的稳定性，对改性Al2O3和替代载体的使用引起了关注。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。H2预处理可以促进GaH等活性物种的形成，这些物种比H+位点和Ga+位点更活跃。应谨慎避免过度还原，以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，阻碍Rh等金属的促进作用。在脱氢和再生过程中，需要广泛地提高催化剂的稳定性。
