1.No relevant quotes were found in the literature provided to answer the question about the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The literature focuses on CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) prepared by the sol-gel method and their catalytic performance in propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
