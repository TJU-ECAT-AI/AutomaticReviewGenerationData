1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The surface acidity of these catalysts plays a significant role in the formation of coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The surface hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 have been shown to affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The geometric effect has been found to contribute more to the dehydrogenation activity than the electronic effect. The SMSI effect between the support and active center has been attributed to the superior performance of some catalysts, with conversion rates of 21.3% and selectivity of 94.4%. The stability of catalysts has been improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The introduction of transition metals has been shown to change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity. The coordination number of the Zn atom around Pt has been found to range from 4 to 6. The performance of some catalysts has surpassed that of PtZn alloys and previously reported nanoclusters, demonstrating nearly 100% selectivity and robust stability. Na-doping has been shown to regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing the adsorption of propane and inhibiting the activation of CH bonds. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
