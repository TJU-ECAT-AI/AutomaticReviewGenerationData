1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts have unique structural properties that can influence their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a significant role in the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 can affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is crucial for the superior performance of these catalysts, contributing to high conversion and selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The geometric effect is more significant than the electronic effect in contributing to dehydrogenation activity. The introduction of transition metals can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, enhancing electron interaction and improving dispersion. The addition of sulfur can promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The optimized catalysts can exhibit higher activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-time stability. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst shows remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
