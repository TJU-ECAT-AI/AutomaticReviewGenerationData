[1] "In 2019, Gao and colleagues developed rod-type porous Al2O3 with various acidity levels to load the Cr2O3 species.83 Compared with the CrOx-based catalysts using commercial Al2O3, the as-synthesized Cr/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better stability and coke resistance, which should be assigned to the low acidity in porous Al2O3."
[2] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction.84"
[3] "Lang et al. found that the mesoporous Al2O3 supported highly distributed Cr components showed enhanced activity and stability in catalytic PDH.85"
[4] "Shao and colleagues synthesized a porous structure of an Al2O3 framework by using in situ Sn doping.92 The abundant surface properties of the Al2O3 support with uniform Sn-related components benefited the formation of polymeric Cr active species, thus contributing to the promoted activity as well as stability."
[5] "Li et al. prepared a Ni-regulating Cr/Al catalyst with apparently enhanced performance, which revealed the outstanding activity owing to the interaction between Ni and Cr components.93"
[6] "Liu and co-workers synthesized a catalyst by changing the addition order of K+ to the precursor.94 It was noted that the addition of K+ before loading Cr onto Al2O3 reduced the acidity of the catalyst and formed single low polymeric Cr components, increasing the coking-resistance properties."
[7] "Zhang and co-workers reported a Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with outstanding activity, which demonstrated that the enhanced stability was attributed to the decreased content of isolated inactive Cr(vi) in the Ce-doped Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.90"
[8] "Zhang et al. prepared PtSn nanoparticles loaded on mesoporous Al2O3, possessing high dispersion and abundant structural properties.45 Benefiting from the strong anchoring of active components by the support, the resulting catalyst displayed enhanced catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[9] "Deng and colleagues synthesized a precursor material through a wet impregnation method and then modified it with Pt nanoparticles, which acted as the major active center by a direct H2 reduction pathway.47 The authors claimed that the superior performance with a conversion of 21.3% and a selectivity of 94.4% is mainly attributed to the SMSI effect between the support and active center."
[10] "A series of Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples were prepared by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 zeolite with different Si/Al atom molar ratios.48 The zeolite supported metal-based catalysts displayed exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[11] "Corma and coworkers opened up an avenue to address the issue through confining bimetal PtSn sub-nanoclusters (0.50.6 nm) in channel walls or cavity holes.49 The results further revealed that the catalysts showed excellent stability and effectively enabled metal migration and sintering agglomeration, thus improving the long-term stability in the PDH process."
[12] "Sun and co-workers investigated nitrogen-doped graphene supported single-atom Pt catalyzing the PDH reaction by using density functional theory (DFT).50 Theoretical results revealed that the nitrogen-doped graphene positively regulated the electronic state of Pt and made the d band of the Pt atom reach close to the Fermi level, which is favorable for the desorption of the product and better reaction activity."
[13] "Liu et al. developed a hybrid nanocarbon catalyst with a nanodiamond core and a defective slim graphene shell supported Pt nanoparticle, demonstrating the strengthening of the metalsupport interaction induced by the donated electrons from the defective graphene shell to Pt nanoparticles.51 The authors proposed that the SMSI and fast propene desorption not only significantly improved the anti-transferring ability, but also greatly increased propylene selectivity."
[14] "Li et al. designed an effective Mxene supported Pt catalyst to catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes, which provides extremely high selectivity to activate the CH bond due to the SMSI effect with respect to the formation of a Pt3Ti ordered intermetallic compound.52"
[15] "Wang et al. synthesized the Pt/BN catalyst via an impregnation method, showing a promoted anti-coking ability and propene selectivity owing to the low acidity of the BN support and SMSI effect.53"

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been shown to have advantages over traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The porous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better dispersion of the active components, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. The low acidity of MCM-41 and SBA-15 also contributes to improved coke resistance and stability. The lattice oxygen species in these supports can interact with the active components to form polymeric Cr active species, which further improves the activity and stability. H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between the Cr species and the support, leading to better stability and anti-coking properties. However, the performance of these catalysts can be limited by the formation of inactive Cr(vi) species and the loss of active components due to sintering agglomeration. The introduction of additives such as Ce, Ni, and K+ can stabilize the active components and improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts.

2.

However, they also have limitations, such as the tendency to form more coke with higher surface acidity and the need for Na-doping to regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components. The reaction mechanisms of these catalysts involve the activation of CH bonds and the formation of propylene, with the deficient step sites in Pt3Sn constituents playing a crucial role in high propylene selectivity and low coking content. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Sokolov and co-workers exploited a supported VOx-based catalyst material with exceptional activity and robust stability during long term reactionregeneration evaluations. The results further revealed that the large VOx nanoparticles and highly polymeric VOx species easily led to coke deposition and the corresponding rapid deactivation. Zhao et al. realized the considerable relationship between the content of V-OH and catalytic stability, demonstrating that the V-OH species help resist the coking reaction and further improve the stability of the catalyst, whereas, the excessive hydroxyl group may block the exposed V3+ active sites on the surface of catalysts, resulting in unfavorable activity. The corresponding V components in a fresh VOx-based catalyst presented different forms such as V5+, V4+, V3+, monovanadate, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5. The loading content of V greatly affects the valence state and polymerization degree, in which the active sites can include the polymeric V3+ and V4+ as well as isolated VOx species (monovanadate). Sokolov et al. designed a series of supports with different acidity levels to support single layer VOx components for catalyzing the PDH reaction. The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst. Shan and colleagues explored catalysts with similar surface densities of V species on variable Al2O3 crystals. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 was proven to affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. Hu et al. synthesized a microporous VOx-SiO2 catalyst with exceptional catalytic performance revealing that the low polymeric VOx species is considered as the major active center during the PDH catalysis. Wu et al. prepared a virus-like structure of a porous SiO2 nanosphere supported VOx catalyst by the solgel method. It is found that adequate VOx loading content and high dispersion degree of the VOx species of the resulting catalyst are critical to achieving excellent catalytic performance in PDH. Xie and colleagues synthesized a catalyst by loading VOx on ZrO2, demonstrating that the SMSI between VOx and ZrO2 is beneficial for the formation of low coordinated V species with respect to the favorable CH activation. Gu et al. used PH3 to modify the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst with P doping, achieving improved catalytic properties including optimized surface acidity, separation of polymeric VOx components, and SMSI. Wu and colleagues also synthesized a Mg-modified VOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Their results indicated that well-dispersed 2D V2O5 nanoparticles can be formed with the introduction of suitable Mg, thus elevating the coke resistance ability and long-term stability.

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts have unique structural properties that can influence their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a significant role in the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 can affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is crucial for the superior performance of these catalysts, contributing to high conversion and selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The geometric effect is more significant than the electronic effect in contributing to dehydrogenation activity. The introduction of transition metals can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, enhancing electron interaction and improving dispersion. The addition of sulfur can promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The optimized catalysts can exhibit higher activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-time stability. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst shows remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
