1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The surface acidity of the catalyst affects the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to more coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 influence the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center contributes to the superior performance of the catalysts, with conversion rates of up to 21.3% and selectivity of 94.4%. The catalysts show excellent stability and enable metal migration and sintering agglomeration, improving long-term stability in the PDH process. The geometric effect contributes more to the dehydrogenation activity than the electronic effect. The improvement of bimetallic PtSn interactions can prevent the formation of by-products and coke. The deficient step sites in Pt3Sn constituents endow the catalyst with high propylene selectivity and low coking content. The introduction of another transition metal can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, improving catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can strongly constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, while the improved dispersion of Pt components is related to the abundant MnOx in the support. The catalysts with adjustable sulfur content show excellent C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The performance of 0.04Pt0.36ZnDeAlBEA surpasses that of PtZn alloys and previously reported nanoclusters, demonstrating nearly 100% selectivity and robust stability. The coordination number of the Zn atom around Pt ranges from 4 to 6. The optimized catalyst shows higher activity and extreme propene selectivity in long-term operation. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing the adsorption of propane and inhibiting the activation of CH bonds. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst presents a remarkable performance with a propane conversion of 32.6% and a propylene selectivity of 94.2%.
2. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts have advantages in terms of surface acidity, polymeric degree of VOx species, SMSI effect, stability, and anti-coking ability. However, they also have limitations, such as the tendency to form more coke with higher surface acidity and the need for Na-doping to regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components. The reaction mechanisms of these catalysts involve the activation of CH bonds and the formation of propylene, with the deficient step sites in Pt3Sn constituents playing a crucial role in high propylene selectivity and low coking content. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中进行了研究。催化剂的表面酸性影响结焦倾向，酸性越高，结焦越多。Al2O3表面OH的含量影响VOx物种的聚合度和VOx与Al2O3支撑之间的相互作用。支撑和活性中心之间的SMSI效应有助于催化剂的优异性能，转化率高达21.3%，选择性为94.4%。催化剂表现出优异的稳定性和金属迁移和烧结聚集能力，提高了PDH过程中的长期稳定性。几何效应比电子效应对脱氢活性的贡献更大。二金属PtSn相互作用的提高可以防止副产物和焦炭的形成。Pt3Sn成分中缺乏的台阶位点使催化剂具有高丙烯选择性和低结焦含量。引入另一种过渡金属可以改变Pt原子表面的电子结构，提高催化性能。Zn锚定位点可以在后合成过程中强烈约束Pt，而Pt成分的分散度提高与支撑中丰富的MnOx有关。具有可调硫含量的催化剂显示出优异的C3H6脱附和抗结焦能力。0.04Pt0.36ZnDeAlBEA的性能超过了PtZn合金和以前报道的纳米簇，显示出近100%的选择性和稳健的稳定性。Zn原子周围Pt的配位数在4到6之间。优化的催化剂在长期运行中表现出更高的活性和极端的丙烯选择性。Na掺杂可以调节Brnsted位点和Cr组分之间的相互作用，减少丙烷的吸附并抑制CH键的活化。5%Cr/Z-5(260)催化剂表现出显著的性能，丙烷转化率为32.6%，丙烯选择性为94.2%。
2. 与传统的金属氧化物支撑相比，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在表面酸性、VOx物种的聚合度、SMSI效应、稳定性和抗结焦能力方面具有优势。然而，它们也有局限性，例如，表面酸性越高，结焦倾向越大，需要Na掺杂来调节Brnsted位点和Cr组分之间的相互作用。这些催化剂的反应机制涉及CH键的活化和丙烯的形成，Pt3Sn成分中缺乏的台阶位点在高丙烯选择性和低结焦含量中起着关键作用。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。
