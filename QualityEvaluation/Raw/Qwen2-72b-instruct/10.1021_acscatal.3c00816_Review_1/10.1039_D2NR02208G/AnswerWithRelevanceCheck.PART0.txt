          [1] "In 2019, Gao and colleagues developed rod-type porous Al2O3 with various acidity levels to load the Cr2O3 species.83 Compared with the CrOx-based catalysts using commercial Al2O3, the as-synthesized Cr/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better stability and coke resistance, which should be assigned to the low acidity in porous Al2O3."
          [2] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction.84"
          [3] "Lang et al. found that the mesoporous Al2O3 supported highly distributed Cr components showed enhanced activity and stability in catalytic PDH.85"
          [4] "Shao and colleagues synthesized a porous structure of an Al2O3 framework by using in situ Sn doping.92 The abundant surface properties of the Al2O3 support with uniform Sn-related components benefited the formation of polymeric Cr active species, thus contributing to the promoted activity as well as stability."
          [5] "Li et al. prepared a Ni-regulating Cr/Al catalyst with apparently enhanced performance, which revealed the outstanding activity owing to the interaction between Ni and Cr components.93"
          [6] "Liu and co-workers synthesized a catalyst by changing the addition order of K+ to the precursor.94 It was noted that the addition of K+ before loading Cr onto Al2O3 reduced the acidity of the catalyst and formed single low polymeric Cr components, increasing the coking-resistance properties."
          [7] "Zhang and co-workers reported a Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with outstanding activity, which demonstrated that the enhanced stability was attributed to the decreased content of isolated inactive Cr(vi) in the Ce-doped Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.90"
          [8] "Zhang et al. prepared PtSn nanoparticles loaded on mesoporous Al2O3, possessing high dispersion and abundant structural properties.45 Benefiting from the strong anchoring of active components by the support, the resulting catalyst displayed enhanced catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."

          [10] "A series of Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples were prepared by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 zeolite with different Si/Al atom molar ratios.48 The zeolite supported metal-based catalysts displayed exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
          [11] "Corma and coworkers opened up an avenue to address the issue through confining bimetal PtSn sub-nanoclusters (0.50.6 nm) in channel walls or cavity holes.49 The results further revealed that the catalysts showed excellent stability and effectively enabled metal migration and sintering agglomeration, thus improving the long-term stability in the PDH process."
          [12] "Sun and co-workers investigated nitrogen-doped graphene supported single-atom Pt catalyzing the PDH reaction by using density functional theory (DFT).50 Theoretical results revealed that the nitrogen-doped graphene positively regulated the electronic state of Pt and made the d band of the Pt atom reach close to the Fermi level, which is favorable for the desorption of the product and better reaction activity."
          [13] "Liu et al. developed a hybrid nanocarbon catalyst with a nanodiamond core and a defective slim graphene shell supported Pt nanoparticle, demonstrating the strengthening of the metalsupport interaction induced by the donated electrons from the defective graphene shell to Pt nanoparticles.51 The authors proposed that the SMSI and fast propene desorption not only significantly improved the anti-transferring ability, but also greatly increased propylene selectivity."
          [14] "Li et al. designed an effective Mxene supported Pt catalyst to catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes, which provides extremely high selectivity to activate the CH bond due to the SMSI effect with respect to the formation of a Pt3Ti ordered intermetallic compound.52"
          [15] "Wang et al. synthesized the Pt/BN catalyst via an impregnation method, showing a promoted anti-coking ability and propene selectivity owing to the low acidity of the BN support and SMSI effect.53"
          [16] "The results confirmed that the tendency to form coke increased with the surface acidity of the catalyst."
          [17] "The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 was proven to affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support."

          [21] "The improvement of bimetallic PtSn interactions can be attributed to the regulated adsorption of light hydrocarbon and intermediates, thus further preventing the formation of by-products and coke."
          [22] "The deficient step sites in Pt3Sn constituents endowed the catalyst with exceptional performance including high propylene selectivity together with low coking content."
          [23] "The optimized d-band center of the Pt atom significantly improves the catalytic performance with the introduction of another transition metal, which opens a new direction for subsurface catalysis in the PDH reaction."
          [24] "The results showed that the post-transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, and Au) modified Pt core greatly changed the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface through a stress effect and charge transfer, making the Co@Pt coreshell catalyst a promising candidate material with both exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity."

          Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts have unique structural properties that can influence their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The surface acidity of the catalyst plays a significant role in the tendency to form coke, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. The contents of surface OH on Al2O3 can affect the polymeric degree of VOx species and the interaction between VOx and the Al2O3 support. The SMSI effect between the support and active center is crucial for the superior performance of these catalysts, contributing to high conversion and selectivity. The stability of the catalysts is also improved by enabling metal migration and preventing sintering agglomeration. The geometric effect is more significant than the electronic effect in contributing to dehydrogenation activity. The introduction of transition metals can change the electronic structure of Pt atoms on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance. The Zn anchoring site can constrain the Pt during post-synthesis, enhancing electron interaction and improving dispersion. The addition of sulfur can promote C3H6 desorption and anti-coking ability. The optimized catalysts can exhibit higher activity, extreme propene selectivity, and long-time stability. Na-doping can regulate the interaction between Brnsted sites and Cr components, decreasing propane adsorption and inhibiting CH bond activation. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst shows remarkable performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
