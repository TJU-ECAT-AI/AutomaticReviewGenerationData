[1] "In 2019, Gao and colleagues developed rod-type porous Al2O3 with various acidity levels to load the Cr2O3 species.83 Compared with the CrOx-based catalysts using commercial Al2O3, the as-synthesized Cr/Al2O3 catalyst showed a better stability and coke resistance, which should be assigned to the low acidity in porous Al2O3."
[2] "Hu et al. used H2 pre-reduction to enhance the interaction between the Cr species and Al2O3 supports, for improving the stability and anti-coking properties of the catalyst in the PDH reaction.84"
[3] "Lang et al. found that the mesoporous Al2O3 supported highly distributed Cr components showed enhanced activity and stability in catalytic PDH.85"
[4] "Shao and colleagues synthesized a porous structure of an Al2O3 framework by using in situ Sn doping.92 The abundant surface properties of the Al2O3 support with uniform Sn-related components benefited the formation of polymeric Cr active species, thus contributing to the promoted activity as well as stability."
[5] "Li et al. prepared a Ni-regulating Cr/Al catalyst with apparently enhanced performance, which revealed the outstanding activity owing to the interaction between Ni and Cr components.93"
[6] "Liu and co-workers synthesized a catalyst by changing the addition order of K+ to the precursor.94 It was noted that the addition of K+ before loading Cr onto Al2O3 reduced the acidity of the catalyst and formed single low polymeric Cr components, increasing the coking-resistance properties."
[7] "Zhang and co-workers reported a Ce-modified Cr/Al2O3 catalyst with outstanding activity, which demonstrated that the enhanced stability was attributed to the decreased content of isolated inactive Cr(vi) in the Ce-doped Cr/Al2O3 catalyst.90"
[8] "Zhang et al. prepared PtSn nanoparticles loaded on mesoporous Al2O3, possessing high dispersion and abundant structural properties.45 Benefiting from the strong anchoring of active components by the support, the resulting catalyst displayed enhanced catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[9] "Deng and colleagues synthesized a precursor material through a wet impregnation method and then modified it with Pt nanoparticles, which acted as the major active center by a direct H2 reduction pathway.47 The authors claimed that the superior performance with a conversion of 21.3% and a selectivity of 94.4% is mainly attributed to the SMSI effect between the support and active center."
[10] "A series of Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 samples were prepared by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 zeolite with different Si/Al atom molar ratios.48 The zeolite supported metal-based catalysts displayed exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[11] "Corma and coworkers opened up an avenue to address the issue through confining bimetal PtSn sub-nanoclusters (0.50.6 nm) in channel walls or cavity holes.49 The results further revealed that the catalysts showed excellent stability and effectively enabled metal migration and sintering agglomeration, thus improving the long-term stability in the PDH process."
[12] "Sun and co-workers investigated nitrogen-doped graphene supported single-atom Pt catalyzing the PDH reaction by using density functional theory (DFT).50 Theoretical results revealed that the nitrogen-doped graphene positively regulated the electronic state of Pt and made the d band of the Pt atom reach close to the Fermi level, which is favorable for the desorption of the product and better reaction activity."
[13] "Liu et al. developed a hybrid nanocarbon catalyst with a nanodiamond core and a defective slim graphene shell supported Pt nanoparticle, demonstrating the strengthening of the metalsupport interaction induced by the donated electrons from the defective graphene shell to Pt nanoparticles.51 The authors proposed that the SMSI and fast propene desorption not only significantly improved the anti-transferring ability, but also greatly increased propylene selectivity."
[14] "Li et al. designed an effective Mxene supported Pt catalyst to catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes, which provides extremely high selectivity to activate the CH bond due to the SMSI effect with respect to the formation of a Pt3Ti ordered intermetallic compound.52"
[15] "Wang et al. synthesized the Pt/BN catalyst via an impregnation method, showing a promoted anti-coking ability and propene selectivity owing to the low acidity of the BN support and SMSI effect.53"

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been shown to have advantages over traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The porous structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 allows for better dispersion of the active components, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and stability. The low acidity of MCM-41 and SBA-15 also contributes to improved coke resistance and stability. The lattice oxygen species in these supports can interact with the active components to form polymeric Cr active species, which further improves the activity and stability. H2 pretreatment can enhance the interaction between the Cr species and the support, leading to better stability and anti-coking properties. However, the performance of these catalysts can be limited by the formation of inactive Cr(vi) species and the loss of active components due to sintering agglomeration. The introduction of additives such as Ce, Ni, and K+ can stabilize the active components and improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中与传统金属氧化物载体相比具有优势。MCM-41和SBA-15的多孔结构允许活性组分更好地分散，从而增强催化活性和稳定性。MCM-41和SBA-15的低酸性也有助于提高焦炭抗性和稳定性。这些载体中的晶格氧物种可以与活性组分相互作用，形成聚合Cr活性物种，进一步提高活性和稳定性。H2预处理可以增强Cr物种与载体之间的相互作用，从而提高稳定性和抗焦炭性能。然而，这些催化剂的性能可能受到Cr(vi)不活性物种的形成和活性组分因烧结聚集而损失的限制。Ce、Ni和K+等添加剂的引入可以稳定活性组分，提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
