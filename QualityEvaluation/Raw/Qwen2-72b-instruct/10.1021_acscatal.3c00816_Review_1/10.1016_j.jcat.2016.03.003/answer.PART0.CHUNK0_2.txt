1.The literature does not provide information on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Therefore, it is not possible to compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports or discuss the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also not addressed in the provided literature.

1.文献没有提供关于金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂,特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能信息。因此,无法将其结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物载体进行比较,也无法讨论其优点、局限性和反应机制。晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活影响的相关信息在提供的文献中也没有提及。
