1.The literature does not provide information on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts in PDH reactions are not discussed. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also not addressed.
