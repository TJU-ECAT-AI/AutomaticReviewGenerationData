[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

1. Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) is a popular support material in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, synthesized through a self-assembly process. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers benefits such as low acidity and a high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and improves resistance to coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in PDH reactions, demonstrating significant propylene productivity but also experiencing rapid deactivation. Initial PDH reactions over as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts produce a small amount of CO, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment, suggesting the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the reaction. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show higher propylene productivity but lower catalytic stability compared to their prereduced versions. Oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is a key factor in catalyst deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits superior catalytic activity to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

1. 有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)是丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中常用的支撑材料，通过自组装过程合成。与传统的金属氧化物支撑材料如无定形SiO2和Al2O3相比，OMS具有低酸性和高比表面积以及有序孔结构的优点，这增强了活性位点的分散并提高了抗焦炭能力。负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中被广泛研究，显示出显著的丙烯生产率，但也经历了快速失活。在制备的MCM-41支撑的VOx和CrOx催化剂上进行的初始PDH反应产生少量的CO，通过H2预处理可以消除，这表明晶格氧物种参与了反应。制备的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出更高的丙烯生产率，但催化稳定性较低，与预还原的版本相比。氧化的CrOx和VOx物种比还原的物种更活跃，晶格氧的耗尽是催化剂失活的关键原因。VOx/MCM-41的催化活性优于CrOx/MCM-41，实现了0.2 kgC3H6每kg催化剂每小时的丙烷生产率和90%的丙烯选择性。
