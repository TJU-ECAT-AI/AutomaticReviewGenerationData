[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts."
[5] "The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[6] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

1. Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) is a popular support in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, synthesized through a self-assembly process. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers benefits such as low acidity and a high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and reduces coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in PDH reactions, showing high propylene productivity but experiencing rapid deactivation. For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO is produced in the initial 3 hours of reaction, which is eliminated by H2 pretreatment, suggesting the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the PDH reaction. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate superior propylene productivity but lower catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and depletion of lattice oxygen is a significant factor in deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 shows better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

1. 有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)是丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中常用的支撑材料，通常通过自组装过程合成。与传统的金属氧化物支撑材料(如无定形SiO2和Al2O3)相比，OMS具有低酸性和高比表面积以及有序孔结构的优点，这有助于活性位点的分散和减少积炭。负载在MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中被广泛研究，显示出较高的丙烯生产率，但经历快速失活。对于制备好的MCM-41支撑的VOx和CrOx催化剂，在初始3小时的反应中会产生少量的CO，而氢气预处理可以消除这种CO产物，表明制备好的CrOx和VOx的晶格氧物种参与了PDH反应。制备好的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出较高的丙烯生产率，但与预还原的对应物相比，催化稳定性较差。氧化态的CrOx和VOx物种比还原态的更活跃，晶格氧的耗尽被认为是失活的重要原因。VOx/MCM-41的催化活性优于CrOx/MCM-41，实现了0.2 kgC3H6每kg催化剂每小时的丙烷生产率和90%的丙烯选择性。
