[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been widely studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers advantages including low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and improves resistance to coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 show significant propylene productivity, but they are prone to rapid deactivation. The initial presence of CO in the reaction over as-prepared catalysts suggests that the lattice oxygen species of CrOx and VOx are involved in the PDH reaction, and this can be eliminated by H2 pretreatment. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts have higher propylene productivity but lower catalytic stability than their prereduced counterparts, indicating that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones, and depletion of lattice oxygen is a key factor in deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 demonstrates better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)催化剂，如MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中得到了广泛研究。与传统的金属氧化物支持物如无定形SiO2和Al2O3相比，OMS具有低酸性、高比表面积和有序孔结构的优点，这增强了活性位点的分散并提高了抗焦炭能力。MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx显示出显著的丙烯生产力，但它们容易快速失活。在预处理催化剂上反应初期CO的存在表明CrOx和VOx的晶格氧物种参与了PDH反应，而这种现象可以通过H2预处理消除。与预还原的对应物相比，预处理的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂具有更高的丙烯生产力但较低的催化稳定性，表明氧化的CrOx和VOx物种比还原的物种更活跃，晶格氧的耗尽是失活的关键原因。VOx/MCM-41的催化活性优于CrOx/MCM-41，实现了每公斤催化剂每小时0.2公斤C3H6的丙烷生产力和90%的丙烯选择性。
