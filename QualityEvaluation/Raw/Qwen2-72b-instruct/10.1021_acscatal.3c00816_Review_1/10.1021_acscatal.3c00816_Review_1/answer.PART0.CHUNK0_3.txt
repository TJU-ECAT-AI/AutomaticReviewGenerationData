[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit superior propylene productivity but inferior catalytic stability compared to their prereduced counterparts. The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."

1. Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) is a common support in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, synthesized through a self-assembly process. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS offers advantages such as low acidity, high specific surface area, and an ordered pore structure, which enhances the dispersion of reactive sites and improves resistance to coking. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in PDH reactions, demonstrating high propylene productivity but also experiencing rapid deactivation. The initial presence of CO in reactions over as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts suggests the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the PDH reaction, which can be eliminated by H2 pretreatment. As-prepared VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts show superior propylene productivity but inferior stability compared to their prereduced counterparts, indicating that oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than reduced ones. Depletion of lattice oxygen is a significant factor in catalyst deactivation. VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 per kg of catalyst per hour and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

1. 有序介孔二氧化硅(OMS)是丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中常用的支撑材料，通过自组装过程合成。与传统的金属氧化物支撑材料(如无定形SiO2和Al2O3)相比，OMS具有低酸性、高比表面积和有序孔结构的优点，这增强了活性位点的分散和提高了抗焦炭能力。在MCM-41和SBA-15上负载的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中被广泛研究，显示出较高的丙烯产量，但同时也经历了快速失活。在MCM-41上负载的VOx和CrOx催化剂的初始反应中检测到CO的存在，表明预处理催化剂的晶格氧物种参与了PDH反应，这可以通过H2预处理消除。与预还原的对应物相比，预处理的VOx/MCM-41和CrOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出优越的丙烯产量，但催化稳定性较差，表明氧化的CrOx和VOx物种比还原的物种更活跃，晶格氧的耗尽是失活的重要原因。VOx/MCM-41的催化活性优于CrOx/MCM-41，实现了0.2 kgC3H6每kg催化剂每小时的丙烷产量和90%的丙烯选择性。
