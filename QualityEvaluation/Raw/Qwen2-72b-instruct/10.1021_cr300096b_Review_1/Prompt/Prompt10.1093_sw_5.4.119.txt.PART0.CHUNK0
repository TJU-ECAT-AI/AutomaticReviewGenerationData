I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Perhaps pooling the efforts of a number of treatment agencies might make it possible to develop a more substantial sample size.
The authors are to be congratulated for a worthy contribution to the research litera- ture in this field.

CHILD WELFARE: PRINCIPLES AND METHODS.
By Dorothy Zietz, M.S.W., Ph.D.
New York: John Wiley 8c Sons, Inc., 1959. 384 pp. $5.50.
This volume is addressed to the college classroom.
The author states that while the material presented is from the social welfare, social action, and planning point of view, it shows as well the interrelation- ship of social work with other professions such as medicine, nursing, education, psy- chiatry, psychology, and law. The book is designed, therefore, to be useful not only in teaching undergraduates who will enter training for social work, but also those who may choose other fields serving people.
The text is divided into five sections.
Part One deals with the social heritage of America.
The place of the church, the government, and private philanthropy in meeting the needs of people is described in relation to changing social conditions.
Part Two discusses significant events in the nineteenth century, Part Three is entitled "The Child in the Twentieth Century," and Parts Four and Five are concerned respectively with children in need of special protection and those with special needs.
The rapid development of social conscious- ness from 1850 to the present is spelled out descriptively, social movements and social institutions are identified, and attention is given to the evolution of social work as a profession with the need for special training being recognized in the early 1900's. Par- ticular attention is given to social move-

ments and legislation in America during the present century. The chapters on protec- tion of children and on those with special needs are informational but greatly over- simplified.
This text is basically informational. Its title, therefore, is somewhat misleading be- cause principles and methods in child wel- fare receive little attention as such. Rather,emphasis is upon broad social reform set in historical perspective.
The author has nevertheless done a creditable job in pre- senting in simple straightforward language events covering large segments of time. It is evident, both from the content and from the references, that Dr. Zietz has digested a great deal of source material in prepara- tion for the writing of this book.
On the whole the author accomplishes her purpose as set forth in the preface.
However, while abiding faithfully by the history of social movements and action, she has offered very little evaluation of signifi- cant social developments. To the reviewer this omission may result in loss of reader interest, particularly when the audience is an undergraduate one. As a factual outline the text may be a valuable source of help to teachers of undergraduate students.

EDITORIAL
(Continued from page 2) step in the NASW certification program- offers few hazards as long as the base of social work is carefully and proudly pro- tected. Toward this end, it is worth noting that the long-term aim of NASW with re- gard to legal regulation on a state basis is the definition of the practice of social work and its restriction to social workers, not the protection of titles such as Certified Social Worker and Registered Social Worker.

<questions>


Provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Include details on the experimental setup, critical process parameters, and specific measures to ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers. How does this method facilitate surface science studies, and what are the key considerations for achieving optimal results?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
