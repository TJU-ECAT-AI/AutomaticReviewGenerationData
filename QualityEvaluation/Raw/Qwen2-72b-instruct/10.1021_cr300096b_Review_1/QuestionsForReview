Provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Include details on the experimental setup, critical process parameters, and specific measures to ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers. How does this method facilitate surface science studies, and what are the key considerations for achieving optimal results?
