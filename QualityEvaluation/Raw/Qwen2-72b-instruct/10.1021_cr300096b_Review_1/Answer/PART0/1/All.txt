{"Quotes": "", "English": "The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces with controlled composition and structure.
