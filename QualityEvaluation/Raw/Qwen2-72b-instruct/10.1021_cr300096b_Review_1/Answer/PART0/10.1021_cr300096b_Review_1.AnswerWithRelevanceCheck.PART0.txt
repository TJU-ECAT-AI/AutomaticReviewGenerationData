          [1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
          [2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
          [3] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
          [4] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
          [5] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
          [6] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating."
          [7] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."
          [8] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
          [9] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."
          [10] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

          Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, making it suitable for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a filament. In thermal evaporation, a thin wire of tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) is wrapped with a wire of the metal to be deposited and heated by resistive heating. The high melting point of W or Ta ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a period to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. Maintaining a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower in the UHV system during evaporation is crucial to prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface.

          物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发，是一种与超高真空（UHV）环境高度兼容的技术，适用于表面科学研究。该方法通过视线沉积在基底上形成金属覆盖层。关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量速率、沉积时间、基底温度和沉积环境，后者可以是真空或选定气体的背景中。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和使用灯丝的热蒸发。在热蒸发中，用钨（W）或钽（Ta）的细丝包裹要沉积的金属丝，并通过电阻加热进行加热。W或Ta的高熔点确保可以沉积金属而不会受到污染。蒸发灯丝放置在带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以将金属导向基底并防止金属沉积在UHV系统其他组件上。金属源被加热到蒸发温度并保持一段时间，以实现可重复的、无杂质的沉积。在蒸发过程中，保持UHV系统中的压力为5×1010托或更低是至关重要的，以防止杂质在双金属表面上积累。
