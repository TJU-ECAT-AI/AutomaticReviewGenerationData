Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, making it suitable for surface science studies \[10.1021/cr300096b_1\]. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a filament. In thermal evaporation, a thin wire of tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) is wrapped with a wire of the metal to be deposited and heated by resistive heating. The high melting point of W or Ta ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination \[10.1021/cr300096b_1\]. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a period to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. Maintaining a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower in the UHV system during evaporation is crucial to prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface \[10.1021/cr300096b_1\]. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\].

This could involve the use of advanced materials for the evaporation filament or the incorporation of real-time monitoring systems to ensure the quality of the deposited layers. Additionally, the application of PVD techniques to the synthesis of complex bimetallic and multimetallic surfaces could open up new avenues for catalysis and surface science research. The precise control over the composition and structure of these surfaces could lead to the discovery of new catalytic materials with enhanced activity and selectivity.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. However, it does mention that Ni was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time. Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers in a controlled UHV environment \[10.1016/j.susc.2003.09.007\].

The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces with controlled composition and structure \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. However, it does mention that Ni was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time. Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers in a controlled UHV environment \[10.1016/j.susc.2003.09.007\].
