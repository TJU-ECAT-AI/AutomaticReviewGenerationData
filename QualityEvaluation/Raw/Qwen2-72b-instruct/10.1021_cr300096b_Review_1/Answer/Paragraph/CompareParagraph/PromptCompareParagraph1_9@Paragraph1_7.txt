2 Preparation and Characterization of Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONS
2.1 Model Surfaces
2.1.1 Preparation of Bimetallic Surfaces
Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament. Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.2&ndash;0.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.05&ndash;0.1 mm) of the metal of interest. The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system. The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 Ã— 10&ndash;10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.
Procedures for the preparation of bimetallic surface structures under UHV conditions have been described in detail previously. (27, 28) For example, when a 3d transition metal is deposited onto a Pt(111) surface at 300 K, the 3d atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) surface configuration. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition of the 3d metal occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the 3d atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) subsurface structure. As shown in Figure 2, monolayer bimetallic surfaces can have three idealized configurations: a surface 3d&ndash;Pt&ndash;Pt(111) configuration, where the metal monolayer grows epitaxially on the surface of the Pt substrate; an intermixed configuration, where the 3d atoms reside in the first two Pt layers to some varying degree; and the subsurface Pt&ndash;3d&ndash;Pt(111) configuration, where the first layer is composed of Pt atoms and the second layer consists of the 3d atoms. Determination of the structures and elemental compositions of various bimetallic surfaces requires the utilization of a battery of UHV techniques, as described in the next section.
2.1.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Surfaces
Auger Electron Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) peak-to-peak intensities and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak areas are often used to quantify the elemental compositions of bimetallic surfaces after normalization by the relevant sensitivity factors and consideration of the sampling depth of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. (10) AES and XPS are also useful techniques to determine the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer, either in a layer-by-layer fashion or via 3-dimensional (3D) island formation. In the latter growth mechanism, a uniform monolayer is not formed because the cohesive energy between metal overlayer atoms (M&ndash;M) is generally higher than the adsorption energy between the metal overlayer and the substrate surface (M&ndash;S). The layer-by-layer and the 3D island growth mechanisms can often be differentiated by measuring the AES or XPS intensities as a function of deposition time. In the layer-by-layer mechanism, the peak intensity of both the metal overlayer and the substrate show distinct breaks, with the first break indicating the deposition time for the completion of the first monolayer. In contrast, such breaks are absent for the 3D island growth mechanism. (10) Because of the relative ease of these experiments, the AES or XPS growth calibration curves should be measured whenever a new overlayer/substrate system is investigated.
Compared with AES and XPS, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) (29) is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces. In LEIS experiments, the surface is bombarded with positive ions of an inert element, such as He, Ne, or Ar, at a relatively low energy (100&ndash;5000 eV). The incident ions are scattered back with an energy that is directly related to the mass of the surface atom with which they collide. Because the ions have different sensitivities toward atoms of different atomic numbers, the intensity of the scattering peaks needs to be normalized to the intensity of a pure surface of each element. In the case of bimetallic surfaces, the sensitivity factor for the substrate is determined by measuring the intensity of the LEIS signal for a clean substrate surface and that of the thick metal film of interest.
Low-Energy Electron Diffraction
Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a useful technique to determine the overlayer structure in bimetallic surfaces. LEED is very useful in identifying the periodicity of the metal overlayer with respect to the single-crystal substrate. (30, 31) For example, LEED studies have helped reveal that bimetallic alloy surfaces, such as Pt80Ni20(001), Pt80Co20(111), and Pt80Fe20(111), all exhibit a pure Pt outermost layer with a Pt-depleted layer underneath. (32) LEED measurements are also important to confirm the epitaxial growth of the metal overlayer.
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is often used to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer in bimetallic surfaces. In STM experiments a tip is scanned over a sample surface in a regular array, adjusting the height of the tip to keep either the tunneling current or the voltage constant between the STM tip and the surface. The fluctuations of intensity can often be related to differing elements, which is useful in determining the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer as well as the morphology of bimetallic surfaces.

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, making it suitable for surface science studies \[10.1021/cr300096b\_1\]. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a filament. In thermal evaporation, a thin wire of tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) is wrapped with a wire of the metal to be deposited and heated by resistive heating. The high melting point of W or Ta ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination \[10.1021/cr300096b\_1\]. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components \[10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001\]. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a period to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. Maintaining a pressure of 5 Ã— 1010 Torr or lower in the UHV system during evaporation is crucial to prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface \[10.1021/cr300096b\_1\]. The experimental setup often includes an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled to ensure optimal deposition conditions \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Before each experiment, the substrate surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles, with subsequent annealing to remove any residual impurities \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition, with the quantity of metal deposited determined by the AES peak-to-peak ratio \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a controlled rate \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\]. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at a controlled rate to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition \[10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013\].
                    
                    Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of novel PVD techniques that can achieve even higher purity and more precise control over the deposition process. The integration of advanced characterization tools, such as in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), could provide deeper insights into the deposition mechanisms and surface properties of bimetallic systems. Moreover, the exploration of new bimetallic combinations and their catalytic properties under controlled UHV conditions could open up new avenues for the design of efficient catalysts for various chemical reactions, including propane dehydrogenation. The optimization of deposition parameters, such as substrate temperature and deposition environment, could lead to the creation of bimetallic surfaces with enhanced stability and reactivity. Additionally, the investigation of the effects of surface morphology and composition on catalytic performance could provide valuable information for the rational design of catalysts. In summary, the PVD technique, particularly thermal evaporation, offers a powerful tool for the preparation of high-purity bimetallic surfaces in UHV environments, which can facilitate surface science studies and the development of advanced catalysts.
