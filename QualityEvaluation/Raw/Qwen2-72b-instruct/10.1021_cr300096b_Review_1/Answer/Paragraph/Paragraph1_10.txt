Physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques, particularly thermal evaporation, are widely utilized for the preparation of high-purity bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup typically involves a UHV chamber where the substrate is placed opposite the evaporation source. Thermal evaporation is achieved by heating the metallic source materials to their vaporization point, often using an electron beam or a resistive heating element. The process parameters, including the evaporation rate, substrate temperature, and vacuum level, are meticulously controlled to ensure uniform and high-quality film deposition. Quality control measures, such as in-situ monitoring with techniques like Auger electron spectroscopy or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, are employed to verify the composition and structure of the deposited films. These measures are crucial for surface science applications, where the precise control of surface properties is essential for studying catalytic reactions, electronic properties, and surface chemistry.
