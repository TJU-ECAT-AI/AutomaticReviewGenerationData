The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition.

{"Quotes": "", "English": "The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces with controlled composition and structure. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include ensuring the purity of the deposited metal, controlling the deposition rate and temperature, and accurately monitoring the surface composition and structure.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2008.05.013"},
