[1] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[2] "The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten."
[3] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer."
[5] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[6] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[8] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

1.The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The process involves line-of-sight deposition, where a metal overlayer is deposited on the target substrate. Critical parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment, which can be vacuum or a background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal filament evaporation. The metal source is typically a tungsten wire wrapped with the metal of interest, which is resistively heated to evaporate the metal without contamination. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto the UHV systems. Conditioning the metal source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than the deposition conditions ensures the deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. The substrate is placed close to the metal source opening, and the UHV system pressure is maintained at 5×1010 Torr or lower to prevent impurity accumulation. The crystal temperature is often maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize impurity adsorption. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers under controlled conditions.

1.物理气相沉积(PVD)技术，特别是热蒸发，是在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面的方法。该过程涉及视线沉积，其中金属覆盖层沉积在目标基板上。PVD合成的关键参数包括金属蒸汽通量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，可以是真空或选定气体的背景。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和热丝蒸发。金属源通常是用感兴趣的金属包裹的钨丝，通过电阻加热蒸发金属，不会造成污染。蒸发丝被安置在不锈钢圆筒中，圆筒的前部有一个开口，用于将金属沉积导向基板，防止金属蒸发到UHV系统上。在略高于沉积条件的电流或电压下对金属源进行许多小时的条件处理，以确保沉积无杂质的金属覆盖层。基板被放置在金属源开口附近，UHV系统的压力保持在5×1010托或更低，以防止杂质积累。沉积过程中，晶体温度通常保持在600 K，以最小化杂质吸附。该方法通过在受控条件下允许沉积高纯度金属覆盖层，促进了表面科学研究。
