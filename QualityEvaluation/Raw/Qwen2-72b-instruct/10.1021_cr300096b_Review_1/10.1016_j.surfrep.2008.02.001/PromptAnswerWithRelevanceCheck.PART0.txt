[1] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[2] "The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten."
[3] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer."
[5] "Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[6] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source."
[7] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[8] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

1.The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The process involves line-of-sight deposition, where a metal overlayer is deposited on the target substrate. Critical parameters for PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and deposition environment, which can be vacuum or a background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal filament evaporation. The metal source is typically a tungsten wire wrapped with the metal of interest, which is resistively heated to evaporate the metal without contamination. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto the UHV systems. Conditioning the metal source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than the deposition conditions ensures the deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. The substrate is placed close to the metal source opening, and the UHV system pressure is maintained at 5×1010 Torr or lower to prevent impurity accumulation. The crystal temperature is often maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize impurity adsorption. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers under controlled conditions.
