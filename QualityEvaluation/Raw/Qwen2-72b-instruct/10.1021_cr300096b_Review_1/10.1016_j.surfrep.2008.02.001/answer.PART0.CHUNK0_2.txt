[1] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[2] "The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten."
[3] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[5] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[6] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

1.The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The process involves line of sight deposition, where a metal overlayer is deposited on the target substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment. The metal source is a tungsten wire wrapped with the metal of interest, which is resistively heated to evaporate the metal without contamination. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto the UHV systems. Conditioning the source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage ensures reproducible deposition of impurity-free metal overlayers. The UHV system pressure should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent impurity accumulation. Maintaining the crystal temperature at 600 K during deposition minimizes impurity adsorption. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers with controlled coverage and composition.

1.物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的方法。该过程涉及视线沉积，其中金属覆盖层沉积在目标基板上。关键工艺参数包括金属蒸汽通量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境。金属源是用感兴趣的金属包裹的钨丝，通过电阻加热蒸发金属，避免污染。蒸发丝被安置在带有开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以引导金属沉积到基板上，并防止金属蒸发到UHV系统上。在稍高的电流或电压下对源进行许多小时的调节，以确保无杂质金属覆盖层的可重复沉积。在蒸发过程中，UHV系统的压力应为5×1010托或更低，以防止杂质积累。在沉积过程中将晶体温度保持在600 K可以最小化杂质吸附。该方法通过允许沉积高纯度金属覆盖层，具有受控的覆盖度和组成，促进了表面科学的研究。
