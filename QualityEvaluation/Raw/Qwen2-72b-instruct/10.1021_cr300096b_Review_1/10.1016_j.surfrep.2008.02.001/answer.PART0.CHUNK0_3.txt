[1] "The PVD methods utilize the line of sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[2] "The metal source consists of a 0.5 mm tungsten (W) wire, which is wrapped around with 0.1 mm wire of the metal of interest. The W wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough and can be resistively heated using either DC or AC power supply. The extremely high melting temperature of the W filament allows the ultra-pure metal wire to evaporate without contamination from the tungsten."
[3] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with an opening of about 1 cm at the front face of the cylinder, to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto the UHV systems."
[4] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for certain amount of time to achieve the reproducible deposition of impurity free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source often takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than that will be used for the metal deposition."
[5] "Once the metal source is conditioned, the bimetallic surface with desired admetal coverage can be achieved by placing the single crystal substrate close to the opening of the metal source. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."
[6] "In many cases, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition to minimize the adsorption of impurities such as CO."

1.The Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) technique, particularly thermal evaporation, is a critical method for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. This technique relies on line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The process parameters that are crucial for controlling the synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, the time of deposition, the substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be either vacuum or a background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation via a thermal filament. The metal source for thermal evaporation is typically a tungsten (W) wire wrapped with the metal of interest, which is resistively heated to evaporate the metal without contamination. The evaporation filament is housed in a stainless steel cylinder with an opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto the UHV systems. Conditioning the metal source to achieve reproducible deposition of impurity-free metal overlayer is essential, which often requires heating the source for many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than that used for deposition. The UHV system should maintain a pressure of 5×1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface. To minimize the adsorption of impurities like CO, the crystal temperature is typically maintained at 600 K during deposition. This method facilitates surface science studies by enabling the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers under controlled conditions, which is critical for achieving optimal results in bimetallic surface synthesis.

1.物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的关键方法。该技术依赖于视线沉积，以在目标基板上产生金属覆盖层。控制合成的关键过程参数包括金属蒸气流速、沉积时间、基板温度以及沉积环境，可以是真空或选定气体的背景。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和通过热丝进行物理蒸发。热蒸发的金属源通常是用感兴趣的金属丝包裹的钨（W）丝，通过电阻加热蒸发金属，避免污染。蒸发丝通常被安置在带有开口的不锈钢圆柱体中，以引导金属沉积到基板上，并防止金属蒸发到UHV系统上。为了实现无杂质金属覆盖层的可重复沉积，对金属源进行条件处理是必要的，这通常需要在比沉积时稍高的电流或电压下加热源数小时。在蒸发过程中，UHV系统应保持5×1010托或更低的压力，以防止杂质在双金属表面上积累。为了最小化像CO这样的杂质吸附，沉积过程中通常将晶体温度保持在600 K。该方法通过在受控条件下实现高纯度金属覆盖层的沉积，促进了表面科学的研究，这对于双金属表面合成获得最佳结果至关重要。
