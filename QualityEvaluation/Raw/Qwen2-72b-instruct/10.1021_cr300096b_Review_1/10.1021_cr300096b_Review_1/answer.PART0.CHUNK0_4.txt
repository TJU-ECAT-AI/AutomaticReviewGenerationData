[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
[3] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[4] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[5] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
[6] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating."
[7] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."
[8] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
[9] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."
[10] "Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition."
[11] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique well-suited for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to form a metal overlayer on the target substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be under vacuum or in the presence of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation. In thermal evaporation, a thin wire of tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) is wrapped with a wire of the metal of interest, and this assembly is connected to a power supply for resistive heating. The high melting point of W or Ta ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature for a specific duration to achieve reproducible, impurity-free deposition. Conditioning the source can take many hours at a slightly higher current or voltage than that used for deposition. To prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface, the UHV system must maintain a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation.

物理气相沉积(PVD)，特别是热蒸发，是一种在超高真空(UHV)环境中创建双金属表面的技术，这种环境对于表面科学研究至关重要。该方法涉及视线沉积，以在目标基板上形成金属覆盖层。关键的工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，后者可以在真空或选定气体的存在下。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和热蒸发。在热蒸发中，用感兴趣的金属丝包裹薄的钨(W)或钽(Ta)丝，并将该组装件连接到电源进行电阻加热。W或Ta的高熔点确保可以沉积金属而不会受到污染。蒸发丝被放置在带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以将金属导向基板并防止金属沉积在UHV系统中的其他组件上。金属源被加热到蒸发温度特定的时间，以实现可重复的、无杂质的沉积。条件化源可能需要许多小时，电流或电压略高于沉积时使用的电流或电压。为了防止杂质在双金属表面上积累，UHV系统在蒸发过程中必须保持5×1010托或更低的压力。
