Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation. In thermal evaporation, a tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, wrapped with the metal of interest, is used as the metal source. The W or Ta wire is heated resistively through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply. The high melting point of the W or Ta filament ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination. The evaporation filament is typically enclosed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To achieve reproducible deposition of a high-purity metal overlayer, the metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a specific duration. Maintaining a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower in the UHV system during evaporation is crucial to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.
