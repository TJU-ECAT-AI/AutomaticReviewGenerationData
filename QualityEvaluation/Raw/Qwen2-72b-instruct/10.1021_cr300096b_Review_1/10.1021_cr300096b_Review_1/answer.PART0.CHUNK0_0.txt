[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
[3] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[4] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[5] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
[6] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating."
[7] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."
[8] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
[9] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."
[10] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation. In thermal evaporation, a tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, wrapped with the metal of interest, is used as the metal source. The W or Ta wire is heated resistively through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply. The high melting point of the W or Ta filament ensures that the metal of interest can be deposited without contamination. The evaporation filament is typically enclosed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto other components in the UHV system. To achieve reproducible deposition of a high-purity metal overlayer, the metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a specific duration. Maintaining a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower in the UHV system during evaporation is crucial to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发，是一种与超高真空（UHV）环境高度兼容的技术，这对于表面科学研究至关重要。该方法通过视线沉积在基板上创建金属覆盖层。关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，后者可以是真空或选定气体的背景中。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和热蒸发。在热蒸发中，使用包裹着所需金属的钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝作为金属源。W或Ta丝通过UHV馈通与DC或AC电源连接进行电阻加热。W或Ta丝的高熔点确保可以在没有污染的情况下沉积所需的金属。蒸发丝通常被封装在一个带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以将金属沉积导向基板，并防止金属蒸发到UHV系统中的其他组件上。为了实现高纯度金属覆盖层的可重复沉积，金属源被加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间。在蒸发过程中，保持UHV系统中的压力为5×1010托或更低是至关重要的，以防止背景杂质在双金属表面上积累。
