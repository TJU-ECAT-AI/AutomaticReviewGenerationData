[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
[3] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[4] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[5] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
[6] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating."
[7] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."
[8] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
[9] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."
[10] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique well-suited for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to form a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which should ideally be in vacuum or with selected background gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation. In thermal evaporation, a tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire is wrapped with the metal of interest and heated resistively to evaporate the metal. The high melting point of W or Ta ensures that the metal is deposited without contamination. The evaporation filament is placed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal onto the substrate and prevent deposition on other UHV system components. To achieve reproducible and impurity-free deposition, the metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a specific time, with the UHV system pressure maintained at 5 × 1010 Torr or lower to avoid background impurities.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发，是一种适用于在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的技术，这种环境对于表面科学研究至关重要。该方法涉及视线沉积，以在基板上形成金属覆盖层。关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气通量速率、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，后者应理想地处于真空或选定的背景气体中。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和热蒸发。在热蒸发中，用感兴趣的金属包裹钨（W）或钽（Ta）丝，并通过电阻加热使其蒸发。W或Ta的高熔点确保了金属的沉积不会受到污染。蒸发丝被放置在一个带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以将金属导向基板并防止沉积在UHV系统其他组件上。为了实现可重复和无杂质的沉积，金属源被加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间，UHV系统压力保持在5×1010托或更低，以避免背景杂质。
