[1] "Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."
[2] "The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate."
[3] "The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases."
[4] "Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament."
[5] "The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.20.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.050.1 mm) of the metal of interest."
[6] "The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating."
[7] "The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta."
[8] "The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system."
[9] "The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer."
[10] "The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface."

Physical vapor deposition (PVD), particularly thermal evaporation, is a technique that is highly compatible with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments, which are essential for surface science studies. This method involves line-of-sight deposition to create a metal overlayer on a substrate. Critical process parameters include the rate of metal vapor flux, deposition time, substrate temperature, and the deposition environment, which can be in vacuum or in the presence of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and thermal evaporation using a filament. In thermal evaporation, a thin wire of tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) is wrapped with a wire of the metal of interest, which is then heated by resistive heating to evaporate the metal. The high melting point of the W or Ta filament prevents contamination of the deposited metal. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder with a small opening to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and prevent metal evaporation onto other components. The metal source is heated to the evaporation temperature and held for a specific time to ensure the deposition of a pure metal overlayer. The UHV system must maintain a pressure of 5 × 1010 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent impurities from accumulating on the bimetallic surface. These measures ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers, which is crucial for surface science studies.

物理气相沉积（PVD），特别是热蒸发，是一种与超高真空（UHV）环境高度兼容的技术，这对于表面科学研究至关重要。该方法通过视线沉积在基板上形成金属覆盖层。关键工艺参数包括金属蒸气流速、沉积时间、基板温度和沉积环境，后者可以在真空或选定气体的背景下进行。常见的PVD方法包括磁控溅射、脉冲激光沉积、电子束溅射和使用灯丝的热蒸发。在热蒸发中，将钨（W）或钽（Ta）的细丝缠绕着所需金属的细丝，然后通过电阻加热使其蒸发。W或Ta灯丝的高熔点防止了沉积金属的污染。蒸发灯丝通常被放置在一个带有小开口的不锈钢圆筒中，以将金属沉积导向基板并防止金属蒸发到其他组件上。金属源被加热到蒸发温度并保持一定时间，以确保纯金属覆盖层的沉积。UHV系统在蒸发过程中必须保持5×1010托或更低的压力，以防止杂质在双金属表面上积累。这些措施确保了高纯度金属覆盖层的沉积，这对于表面科学研究至关重要。
