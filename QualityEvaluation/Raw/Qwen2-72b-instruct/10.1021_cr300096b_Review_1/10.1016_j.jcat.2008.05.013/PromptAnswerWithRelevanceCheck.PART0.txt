1.The physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, specifically thermal evaporation, is a method used to create bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. The experimental setup involves a two-level stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is spot-welded to two tantalum posts and can be resistively heated to 1100 K or cooled with liquid nitrogen to 100 K. The crystal temperature is accurately monitored and controlled by spot welding a thermocouple to the back of the Pt(111) crystal and connecting this signal to a feedback controller. Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface is cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This is followed by oxygen dosing at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface is then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This is accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply. The quantity of 3d metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. Each surface is prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which is deposited at a rate of 0.2-0.3 ML/min. The thermal behavior of the deposited metal is monitored by heating the surface at 3 K/s to increasingly high temperatures and performing AES scans once the surfaces are cooled to below 500 K to determine changes in the surface composition. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces with controlled composition and structure. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include ensuring the purity of the deposited metal, controlling the deposition rate and temperature, and accurately monitoring the surface composition and structure.

1.物理气相沉积（PVD）技术，特别是热蒸发，是在超高真空（UHV）环境中创建双金属表面的方法。实验设置涉及一个两层的不锈钢UHV室，配备有Auger电子光谱仪（AES）用于表面表征，以及四极质量光谱仪（MS）用于温度编程脱附（TPD）实验和现场验证所加气体的纯度。Pt(111)单晶圆盘被点焊到两个钽柱上，可以电阻加热到1100 K或用液氮冷却到100 K。通过在Pt(111)晶体背面点焊一个热电偶并将其信号连接到反馈控制器，可以准确监控和控制晶体温度。在每次实验前，Pt(111)表面通过在600 K下的多次Ne+溅射循环进行清洁，随后闪蒸到1050 K。这之后是890 K的氧气加注和1050 K下5分钟的退火。然后通过物理气相沉积使用3d金属修改表面。这是通过将所需3d金属的0.1 mm直径线缠绕在0.5 mm直径的钨线上，将此线绕成一个灯丝，并将灯丝封闭在一个不锈钢护套中来实现的，当灯丝通过DC电源电阻加热时，将3d金属蒸汽导向Pt(111)表面。所沉积的3d金属的量由3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES峰到峰比确定。每个表面都用大约一个单层（ML）的相应3d金属制备，以0.2-0.3 ML/min的速率沉积。通过以3 K/s的速率将表面加热到越来越高的温度并进行AES扫描，一旦表面冷却到500 K以下，就确定表面组成的变化，从而监测所沉积金属的热行为。该方法通过允许创建具有受控组成和结构的明确定义的双金属表面，从而促进表面科学的研究。为了获得最佳结果，关键考虑因素包括确保所沉积金属的纯度，控制沉积速率和温度，以及准确监控表面组成和结构。

The experimental setup typically involves a UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. A Pt(111) single-crystal disk is used as the substrate, which can be resistively heated to high temperatures or cooled with liquid nitrogen. The 3d metal is deposited using physical vapor deposition by wrapping a wire of the desired 3d metal around a tungsten wire, winding it into a filament, and enclosing it in a stainless steel shield. The filament is then resistively heated to vaporize the 3d metal, which is deposited onto the Pt(111) surface. The quantity of metal deposited is determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio. The deposition rate is typically 0.2-0.3 monolayers per minute. The temperature during deposition is critical, as it determines whether the metal remains on the surface or diffuses into the subsurface region. Depositing the metal at room temperature results in a surface monolayer, while depositing at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of a surface alloy enriched in Pt. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the creation of well-defined bimetallic surfaces for the investigation of their catalytic properties. To achieve optimal results, it is important to ensure the purity of the gases used, to perform several Ne+ sputter cycles and annealing steps to clean the Pt(111) surface before deposition, and to accurately monitor and control the crystal temperature during deposition.
