1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. However, it does mention that Ni was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time. Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers in a controlled UHV environment. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include controlling the deposition rate, ensuring the purity of the source material, and maintaining a high vacuum to prevent contamination.

1.文献没有提供全面概述物理气相沉积(PVD)技术,专注于在超高真空(UHV)环境中通过热蒸发创建双金属表面。但是,它确实提到Ni通过物理气相沉积沉积。源由包裹在电阻加热钨丝周围的Ni线组成。在STM室中,整个装置被水冷不锈钢夹克和可调挡板包围。LEIS室中的Ni源也被水冷。在其他室中,不锈钢护罩包围了整个装置。在Ni蒸发期间,充分排气源后,室背景压力保持在7×10^-10托以下。Ni源以恒定电流运行,沉积在晶体上的Ni量由曝光时间控制。不同室中的AES、XPS、LEIS和STM的组合用于表征沉积在Pt(1 1 1)表面上的Ni量。该方法通过在受控UHV环境中允许沉积高纯度金属覆盖层,从而促进表面科学研究。获得最佳结果的关键考虑因素包括控制沉积速率、确保源材料的纯度和保持高真空以防止污染。
