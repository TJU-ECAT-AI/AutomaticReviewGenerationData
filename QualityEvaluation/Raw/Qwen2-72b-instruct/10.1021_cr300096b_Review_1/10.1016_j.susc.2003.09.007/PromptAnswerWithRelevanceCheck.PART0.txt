Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. Include details on the experimental setup, critical process parameters, and specific measures to ensure the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers. How does this method facilitate surface science studies, and what are the key considerations for achieving optimal results?

1.The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, focusing on thermal evaporation for creating bimetallic surfaces in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environments. However, it does mention that Ni was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire. In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 10^-10 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time. Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. This method facilitates surface science studies by allowing the deposition of high-purity metal overlayers in a controlled UHV environment. Key considerations for achieving optimal results include controlling the deposition rate, ensuring a clean and stable source material, and monitoring the deposition process with appropriate surface analysis techniques.

1.文献没有提供物理气相沉积(PVD)技术的全面概述,重点是超高真空(UHV)环境下通过热蒸发创建双金属表面。但是,它确实提到Ni通过物理气相沉积。源由包裹在电阻加热钨丝周围的Ni线组成。在STM室中,整个装置被水冷不锈钢夹克和可调挡板包围。LEIS室中的Ni源也被水冷。在其他室中,不锈钢屏蔽包围了整个装置。在Ni蒸发期间,充分排气后,室背景压力保持在7×10^-10托以下。Ni源以恒定电流运行,沉积在晶体上的Ni量由曝光时间控制。不同室中的AES、XPS、LEIS和STM的组合用于表征沉积在Pt(1 1 1)表面上的Ni量。该方法通过在受控UHV环境中允许沉积高纯度金属覆盖层,从而促进表面科学研究。为了获得最佳结果,关键考虑因素包括控制沉积速率,确保清洁和稳定的源材料,并使用适当的表面分析技术监测沉积过程。
