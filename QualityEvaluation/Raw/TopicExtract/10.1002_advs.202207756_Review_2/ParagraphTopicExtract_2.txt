Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

    Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga (Figure 5a). A similar trend was observed for the propane cracking reaction (C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4), indicating that both PDH and cracking occur on the same active site (a similar trend was later reported by Yuan et al.).[55] The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely. If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity. Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]

    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The main topic revolves around the effect of Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and catalytic activity in Ga/H-ZSM-5, particularly focusing on the unexpected non-monotonic trend in PDH rates and its implications for understanding the nature of active Ga species.
