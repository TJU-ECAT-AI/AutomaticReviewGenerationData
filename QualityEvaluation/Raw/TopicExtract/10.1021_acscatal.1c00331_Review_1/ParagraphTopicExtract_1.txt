Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds. (38) A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. (39) The proportion of each kind of coke and species under their reaction condition were given, and the aliphatic cokes take up the larger part of coke deposition, with the ratio of C/H around 1.5. However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts. (40) It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition.
