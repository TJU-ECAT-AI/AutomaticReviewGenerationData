Here's the integrated analysis based on the multiple topic extractions and generated questions:

```xml
<integrated_analysis>
  <synthesized_topic_extraction>
    <common_themes>
      - Composition and variability of coke deposits in catalytic systems
      - Focus on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions
      - Complexity of coke formation
      - Dependence on reaction conditions and catalyst types
      - Analysis methods for coke components
    </common_themes>
    
    <key_concepts>
      - Coke as undesirable organic compound deposits
      - Three main species of coke: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite
      - GC-MS and TG analysis techniques
      - Variation of coke species on different catalysts
      - Lack of universal definition for coke due to its complex nature
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics and ideas, I identified the recurring themes and concepts across all inputs. I then combined these elements to create a comprehensive topic that encompasses all aspects of coke formation, composition, and analysis in catalytic systems, with a particular focus on PDH reactions.
    </integration_process>
    
    <final_extracted_topic>
      The composition, variability, and analysis of coke deposits in catalytic systems, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, considering the influence of reaction conditions, catalyst types, and analytical techniques on the complex nature of coke formation and characterization.
    </final_extracted_topic>
  </synthesized_topic_extraction>

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the common elements across all generated questions, such as the focus on composition variability, influencing factors, and analytical techniques. I then formulated a comprehensive question that addresses all these aspects while maintaining a clear and concise structure.

    <final_generated_question>
      <english>How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?</english>
      <chinese>在催化体系中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成如何随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化，以及使用了哪些分析技术来阐明这些体系中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性？</chinese>
