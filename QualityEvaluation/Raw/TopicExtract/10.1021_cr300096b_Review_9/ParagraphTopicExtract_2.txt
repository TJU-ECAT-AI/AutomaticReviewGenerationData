  <original_paragraph>
    Catalytic hydrogenation of the C═O bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis. (315, 316) The selective hydrogenation of the C═O bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. (315, 317) More recently, C═O bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. (318, 319) In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over Pt–Ni bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation. The rest of the section will focus on using bimetallic surfaces and catalysts to promote the selective C═O bond hydrogenation in unsaturated aldehydes.
