    <common_themes>
      - Hierarchical zeolites and their structure
      - Application in PDH (propane dehydrogenation) reactions
      - Combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores
      - Enhanced accessibility and confinement effect
      - Types of hierarchical molecular sieves
      - Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites

      - Hierarchical zeolites
      - Micropores and mesopores/macropores
      - Enhanced accessibility
      - Confinement effect
      - PDH (propane dehydrogenation) reaction
      - Types of hierarchical molecular sieves (mesoporous zeolites, 2D/layered zeolites, pillared zeolites)
      - Synthesis methods (desilication, self-assembly, bifunctional surfactants, cotemplates)
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics and ideas, I identified the recurring themes across all inputs and combined them into a comprehensive topic. I focused on the structure of hierarchical zeolites, their application in PDH reactions, the types of these materials, and their synthesis methods. This approach ensures that all key aspects from the individual analyses are represented in the final integrated topic.

      Hierarchical zeolites: structure, synthesis methods, types, and applications in PDH reactions
    </final_extracted_topic>
  </synthesized_topic_extraction>

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the core elements present in most of the generated questions. These include the structure of hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, types, and specific application in PDH reactions. I then formulated a comprehensive question that addresses all these aspects, ensuring a broad yet focused inquiry into the topic.

    <final_generated_question>
      <english>How do hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, what are the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how do they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites?</english>
