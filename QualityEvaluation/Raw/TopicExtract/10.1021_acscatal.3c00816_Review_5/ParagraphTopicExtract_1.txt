Here's the analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores). (144) For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates (Figure 7a–c).
  </original_paragraph>
  
  <topic_extraction>
    <step1_initial_thoughts>
      The paragraph introduces hierarchical zeolites and their structure, emphasizing their unique combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores. It also mentions different types of hierarchical molecular sieves used in PDH reactions.

    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The main focus is on hierarchical zeolites, their structure, and their application in PDH reactions. The topic should encompass the definition of hierarchical zeolites and their types used in PDH reactions.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we should address both the structure of hierarchical zeolites and the types used in PDH reactions. This will cover the main aspects discussed in the paragraph.
