Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores). (144) For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates (Figure 7a–c).
  </original_paragraph>
  
  <topic_extraction>
    <step1_initial_thoughts>
      The paragraph introduces hierarchical zeolites and their structure, focusing on their application in PDH reactions. It also mentions different types of hierarchical molecular sieves and their synthesis methods.
