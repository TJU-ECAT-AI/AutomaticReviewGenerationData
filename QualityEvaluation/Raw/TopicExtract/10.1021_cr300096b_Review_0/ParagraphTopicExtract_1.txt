  <original_paragraph>
    The field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically catalysis on bimetallic alloys, has seen many advances over the past few decades. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts. (1-3) The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications. Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalytic (4) and electrocatalytic (5, 6) applications.
