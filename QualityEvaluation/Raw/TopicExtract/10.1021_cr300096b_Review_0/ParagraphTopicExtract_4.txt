Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support. The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the "pressure gap" between UHV environment and reaction environment. We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis. We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
