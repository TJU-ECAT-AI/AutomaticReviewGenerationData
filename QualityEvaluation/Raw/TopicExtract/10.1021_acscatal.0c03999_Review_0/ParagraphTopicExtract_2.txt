  <original_paragraph>
    Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives. (2) At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation. (4) Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. (5) Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity.
