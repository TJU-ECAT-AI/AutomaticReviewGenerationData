Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2.

2.2.3 Carbenium Mechanism versus Alkyl Mechanism
The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane. Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b).[76, 133] The H2 pressure range covered by Iglesia and co-workers' report (0–25 kPa) was broader than that of Bell and co-workers' (0–1.5 kPa) by roughly a factor of ten, suggesting that the reaction mechanism proposed by the former was applicable in a wider parameter space. Bell and co-workers reported that the PDH rate was roughly 1st order at low propane partial pressure and 0th order at higher pressure,[76] the latter which corresponded to the region of active sites saturated by adsorbed propane. The carbenium mechanism also predicts a similar trend of propane reaction order, though the transition from positive to zero reaction order may occur at a different propane partial pressure. Thus, kinetic results alone are unlikely to unambiguously differentiate the two mechanisms.
Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+. Hensen and co-workers applied DRIFTS to investigate the ethane dehydrogenation pathway on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and observed the CH stretching modes attributable to Ga-C2H5 (Figure 13a).[141] This was confirmed by Yuan et al.'s results of propane in both H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 13b).[55] On H-ZSM-5, propane treatment led to the appearance of four peaks centered at 2976, 2937, 2903, and 2878 cm−1 (Figure 13bi): assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, symmetric CH3, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively.[142-144] Three peaks distinct from those on H-ZSM-5 centered at 2966, 2931, and 2874 cm−1 were detected on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with two different Ga loadings (Figure 13bii,iii), that is, the presence of Ga alters the CH stretching bands. Interpreting these subtle differences demands caution, as the local environment of adsorbed hydrocarbons could affect spectral features. The possibility that both Ga-C3H7 and C3H7+ are present and in turn, both the carbenium and the alkyl mechanisms are at play, cannot be ruled out. Thus, PDH could occur via different mechanisms on different types of Ga sites. Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species.
DFT calculations have also been extensively employed to compare the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms,[77, 102, 145-148] but without a clear consensus. Pidko et al. examined the ethane activation pathway using Ga+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+ as models in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. By comparing the energies of the initial CH activation in ethane at these sites, it was concluded that the reaction most likely occurred at the Ga+ site via the alkyl route. Meanwhile, both [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ sites showed high activation energies.[145] Mansoor et al. also examined the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation reaction on Ga+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+ using larger cluster models with different Al pair distances.[102] They found [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ were more active in ethane dehydrogenation than Ga+. Interestingly, the RDS was found to depend on the reaction pathway and proposed active sites. For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS. For the [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS when the reaction proceeds via the alkyl pathway, however, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable with a similar ethene formation and CH activation energy. Schreiber et al. compared propane activation over BAS (H+), Ga+, and Ga+–H+ pair, and found both H+ and Ga+ show a higher activation energy of propane than the Ga+–H+ pair.[77] The Ga+–H+ pair is likely to catalyze PDH via the alkyl pathway. Computational investigations of propane activation mechanism on the newly identified Ga2O22+ supported on MFI have yet to be reported and could be an interesting direction to explore in future studies.
3 Concluding Remarks and Perspectives
The structural complexity of zeolite-supported metal catalysts affords them rich chemistry and unique catalytic properties. Despite best synthetic efforts, metals are typically present in the zeolite in multiple forms, for example, metal cations, cationic metal hydroxide or oxide species, and neutral hydroxide and oxide species. Elucidating metal speciation in zeolite is challenging but a prerequisite for identifying active structures and understanding reaction mechanisms. We took Ga/H-ZSM-5 as an example to highlight that technological advances and conceptual innovations could deepen the understanding of structure–activity relations. The employment of advanced in situ characterization techniques, for example, XANES, provided foundational knowledge regarding how Ga/H-ZSM-5 was activated in the reducing environment, while quantitative techniques, such as FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration, enabled the determination of the density of multiple Ga species. The recognition of framework Al distribution as a relevant variable in PDH activity introduced a new dimension in understanding the Ga speciation, which led to the discovery of Ga2O22+ as the most active species in the PDH.
In light of the crucial role of framework Al pairs in H-ZSM-5 to stabilize Ga2O22+, the ability to synthesize Al-pair-rich H-ZSM-5 could increase the density of Ga2O22+. Gounder and co-workers[127, 128, 149] employed organic and inorganic structure-directing agents to tune the Al distribution in CHA and MFI zeolites, which offers a viable path to optimize the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5. Reducing the diffusion length of propane and propylene from the active Ga species could also enhance PDH activity. Wannapakdee et al.[150] prepared Ga/H-ZSM-5 nanosheets, and found that the propane conversion is three times higher than that of conventional zeolites. Their follow-up work indicated that this strategy was effective for n-pentane conversion.[151]
Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts show excellent stability in PDH at low conversions (<10%).[55, 76] The stability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 for PDH has been less studied at higher conversions. This is primarily because the rates were measured at low conversions to obtain the intrinsic reaction rates required to establish structure–activity relationships. At higher propane conversions, side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization, aromatization, and carbon deposition, can also occur due to BAS, which are common in hydrocarbon catalysis on acidic zeolite catalysts at high temperatures.[97, 120, 152] Fabricating zeolites with better diffusion properties, for example, with hierarchical structures and in the nanosheet form, has been shown to be an effective strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability,[97] which could be leveraged to enhance the stability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in PDH.[153, 154]
Ga2O22+ was predicted by DFT calculations more than a decade before its experimental discovery, highlighting the potential of a combined experimental and computational approach in determining the structure of the active center. A few strategies employed in the mechanistic studies of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyzed PDH could help determine active structures in metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts in general: 1) Determining the BAS consumption versus metal/Al ratios. The relationship between BAS consumption versus metal/Al ratios is essential in estimating the density of cationic metal species entered into metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts via ion-exchange. Although multiple methods are available to determine the BAS densities, infrared spectroscopy with pyridine as the probe molecule is the most reliable and can be conducted on catalysts after in situ pretreatment. 2) Quantitative pulse reactions could determine the oxidation state of metal species and differentiate different species based on their redox properties. 3) Employing probe molecules, for example, H2, H2O, and CO, in spectroscopic studies could be informative in distinguishing different active structures. 4) Correlating trends in intrinsic rates and Eapp with densities of multiple active sites could help determine the most active structure.
