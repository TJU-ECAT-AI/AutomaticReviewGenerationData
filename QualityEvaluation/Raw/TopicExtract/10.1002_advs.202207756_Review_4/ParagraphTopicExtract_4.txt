Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2.

    <step2_key_concepts>
      - Alkyl mechanism
      - Propane activation by metal cation
      - Alkyl gallium intermediate formation
      - β-elimination
      - Propylene and H2 desorption
      - CH activation as rate-determining step (RDS)
    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The paragraph focuses on explaining the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation, emphasizing its key steps and rate-determining step.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address the key steps of the alkyl mechanism and its rate-determining step. The question should prompt a detailed explanation of the process.
