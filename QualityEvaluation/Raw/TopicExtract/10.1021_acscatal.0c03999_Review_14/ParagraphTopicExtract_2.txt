  <original_paragraph>
    Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion. In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides. For CO2- and N2O–ODHP, the explored catalyst systems are analogous. However, differences in inherent properties of reactions and difficulties in dealing with corrosiveness have led to complications in advancing the research, resulting in unique challenges and future research directions for each route. In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the C–H bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases.
