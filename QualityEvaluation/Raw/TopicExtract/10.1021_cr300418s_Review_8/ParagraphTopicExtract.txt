    <integration_process>
      The integration process involved identifying recurring themes across all inputs, such as the focus on SVDs and their effects on metal oxides. While most inputs concentrated on SVDs, one input discussed HVDs, which was incorporated to provide a more comprehensive view. The process also involved combining the various aspects of dopant behavior, including their effects on different types of oxides and the underlying mechanisms, to create a more holistic topic.
