Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    The effect of high-valence dopants on the chemistry of the host oxide is more complex than that of LVDs because it depends on whether the host is reducible or not. It is easiest to understand why this is so in terms of Lewis acid–base interactions. (221) In an irreducible oxide (e.g., ZnO), a high-valence dopant, such as Al, has one excess electron (two out of the three valence electrons of Al are used to "replace" Zn2+). This formal electron counting is not rigorous, but it is very helpful in understanding the behavior of an oxide doped with an HVD. If the host oxide is irreducible, this additional electron is localized on the dopant. (260, 272) This means that the dopant is a Lewis base, and this controls some of its chemistry. A high-valence dopant in a reducible oxide (e.g., Ta dopant in CeO2) behaves differently. (258) Because Ce4+ cations are easily reduced to Ce3+ (Ce4+ is a Lewis acid), an HVD can donate its "excess" electrons to reduce Ce ions in the host oxide. For example, (258) hexavalent W or Mo dopants donate two electrons and reduce two Ce4+ ions; pentavalent Ta or Nb dopants donate one electron and reduce one Ce4+ ion. Thus, these high-valence dopants are formally tetravalent, and as a result they do not affect reducible oxides in the same way they would affect the irreducible ones.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address the main aspects of the topic: the difference in behavior, the types of oxides, and the underlying mechanisms. The question should prompt an explanation that covers these key points.
