Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Quite a bit of work has been devoted to the situation when the dopant and the cation being substituted have the same valence. Calculations have been performed to study the properties of TiO2 doped with Ce, (361) Zr, (361) and Pt (141) and of CeO2 doped with Zr, (229, 235, 255, 258, 334, 361, 362) or with Ti, (362) or Hf, (362) or Pd, (229) or Pt, (258) or Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb. (363) We note in particular a study by Mayernick and Janik (229) on methane activation by Zr-doped ceria. All of these calculations show that the dopant affects favorably the properties of the host oxide. We mention a few experimental papers, many of which investigated the modification of the oxygen release in CeO2 doped with same-valence dopants, such as Zr, (364-367) Ti, (365, 368-374) Sn, (375) or Sn. (376) Other studies investigated the redox properties of CeO2 doped with Ti, (377) CO oxidation by CeO2 doped with Pt, (378) water–gas shift by Pt-doped CeO2, (379) and methane oxidation by ZrCeO2. (380) In all cases, doping with an SVD improves performance. However, we were unable to formulate any simple rules regarding the SVDs in catalysis other than to say that they should be tried, especially if one tunes the properties of an oxide that is already an efficient catalyst.
