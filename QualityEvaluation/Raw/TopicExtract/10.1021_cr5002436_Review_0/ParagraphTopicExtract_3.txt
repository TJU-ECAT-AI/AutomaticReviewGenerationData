  <original_paragraph>
    From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:
However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chatelier's principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550–750 °C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2–C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions ≥50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8). Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol–1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol–1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol–1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis. The pressure dependence is also shown in Figure 8, lower pressures clearly resulting in higher olefin yields at a given temperature.
