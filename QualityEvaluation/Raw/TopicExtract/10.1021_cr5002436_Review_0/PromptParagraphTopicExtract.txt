Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Light Alkanes on Metals and Metal Oxides

1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
1.1 Setting the Scene
Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde). (1-4) The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn. (5) In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown. (6) Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins. For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced. (7)

A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies. In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner. In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence. (8, 9) This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals. This includes light olefins, which can be obtained by first converting natural gas into synthesis gas and by subsequently converting the latter either directly through the Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefins (FTO) process or indirectly through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) route with an intermediate methanol synthesis step. (10, 11)

Haynesville Shale (one well) 95.0 0.1 0 4.8 0.1
aLarger hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and oxygen are present in trace amounts and are not given. (12)
As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas. (13) Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council. (14)
The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins. (15) Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). (16, 17) However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction. (18-21)
Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan. (22-25)
1.2 Scope of This Review
Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction. First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction. Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail. Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed. For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed. Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins. For example, Bhasin et al. wrote an extensive review on the industrial application of dehydrogenation technologies in 2001, which includes a comparative discussion of the state of the art of oxidative dehydrogenation technologies. (26) Two more review articles by Vora and Bricker (UOP) were published in 2012. In the first review article, Vora gives a general overview of the dehydrogenation of light olefins and ethylbenzene on Pt-based catalysts, discussing important principles for catalyst and reactor design. (27) In the second review paper, Bricker addresses catalyst design in more detail, emphasizing mass transfer and the use of selective hydrogen combustion to increase olefin yield. (28) Other reviews focusing on a specific family of dehydrogenation catalysts have also been published. For example, Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt reviewed the dehydrogenation of alkanes on supported chromium oxide catalysts in 1999. (29) Dehydrogenation of alkanes on vanadium and chromium oxides is also discussed by Jackson et al. in a book on metal oxide catalysis published in 2009. (30) The chemistry of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation has been further discussed in a review by Albonetti et al. (31) Another review by Cavani et al. discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides. The authors conclude that, although the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has potential, the oxidative dehydrogenation of higher paraffins is still far from being commercially applied. (32) The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins on both supported and bulk transition metal oxides has also been discussed by Copéret in a review focused on C–H bond activation. (33) Also of note are three reviews by Krylov, Wang, and Ansari, where the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is discussed. (34-36) Finally, in a chapter by Caspary et al. in the most recent edition of the Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis, the dehydrogenation of alkanes is discussed broadly, albeit emphasis is placed on CrOx and Pt catalysts, on the kinetics and mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction, and on reactor technology. (37)
2 Commercial Dehydrogenation Processes
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
To date, five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, two of which are currently being used to produce light olefins. (38-41) As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe. (16, 17) The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 4–5% on a yearly basis. (42, 43) Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018. (16, 17, 44) Additionally, six isobutane dehydrogenation installations are currently in operation, with three other plants planned. (43) The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies. A compilation of all existing and planned propane dehydrogenation installations is shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, in Table 2, a comparison is made between the two most important processes, Catofin and Oleflex. The STAR (UHDE) process will be applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East. The other two processes, fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) process (Snamprogetti and Yarsintez) and Linde-BASF PDH, have not yet been commercially applied.
2.1 Catofin Process
The Catofin process, by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, which originally was exclusively used for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. In turn, isobutene was employed for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel additive used to raise the octane number of gasoline. For environmental reasons, the use of MTBE has declined in recent years, causing a shift in the use of Catofin installations to alternative purposes, such as propane dehydrogenation. A Catofin installation generally consists of 5–8 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromia–alumina catalyst. The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 °C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. (26) Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (15–30 min being needed for one full cycle). Each individual reactor is made to run continuously so there are always some units performing dehydrogenation reactions, while other reactors are being regenerated or purged, which results in a constant flow of reaction products. (46) A schematic of a Catofin dehydrogenation installation is shown in Figure 3. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Part of the heat required for the reaction is introduced to the reactors by preheating the reaction feed, additional heat being provided by adjacent reactors that are regenerating the coked catalysts. Moreover, fuel gas is added to the reactor during the regeneration step to generate supplementary heat, (47) and inert material is added to the catalyst bed to increase its heat storage capacity. (48) The catalyst remains in use for 2–3 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span. (29, 49)
2.2 Oleflex Process
The Oleflex process by UOP uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. A schematic representation is shown in Figure 4. (50) The reaction is run using a Pt–Sn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 °C. Three or four adiabatic radial flow reactors containing the catalyst are connected in series with preheaters in between. These gas flow preheaters represent the main source of heat of the reactor system. The catalyst flows through the system, the last reactor being connected to a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit that regenerates the catalyst by burning of any carbon deposits and redisperses the Pt on the support material by means of treating the catalyst with a chlorine–air mixture. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 5–10 days. Product recovery is done by cooling, compressing, and drying the reactor effluent, hydrogen being cryogenically separated from the hydrocarbons. The latter are led through a selective hydrogenation unit to remove diolefins and acetylenes. Polymer-quality propylene is obtained after flowing the hydrocarbons through a de-ethanizer and a propane–propylene splitter. More detailed information on the Catofin and Oleflex processes is presented in Table 2.

catalyst lifetime 2–3 years before the reactor is shut down and the catalyst is replaced; catalyst lifetime is prolonged by increasing the temperature to maintain high propylene yield at the cost of lower selectivity 1–3 years, new catalyst being continuously added to the reactor system and dusts formed due to catalyst attrition being continually removed
2.3 Other Patented Alkane Dehydrogenation Processes
The Steam Active Reforming (STAR) process developed by Uhde utilizes a very different reactor setup. The reaction is run at 6–9 bar and at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C, steam being added to the feed to reduce paraffin partial pressure and coke formation. Because the catalyst has to be stable in the presence of steam, Pt–Sn supported on a (basic) zinc–aluminate is used with calcium/magnesium–aluminate as a binder. Very little coke is deposited on the catalyst surface, and thus dehydrogenation cycles may be as long as 7 h before regeneration becomes necessary.
A fixed bed reactor system is used, consisting of two separate reactors placed in series. (37, 56) The first is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven. Most of the heat is provided at the top of the reactor, where the dehydrogenation activity is highest. The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled prior to being introduced into the second so-called oxyreactor, where an oxygen–steam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. In addition, the combustion of hydrogen provides the heat required for the additional conversion of propane. The olefins in the resulting gas mixture are separated from any residual hydrogen and other side products, which are combusted to heat the dehydrogenation reactor oven. A schematic representation of this reactor setup is shown in Figure 5. Currently, two dehydrogenation installations using the Uhde STAR process are being constructed in Egypt and Iran.
Figure 6 shows a schematic representation of the Fluidized Bed Dehydrogenation (FBD) process, licensed by Snamprogetti and Yarsintez, in which a fluid catalytic cracking-like reactor system is used for the dehydrogenation of propane. An alkane is flowed through a staged fluidized bed at pressures between 1.1 and 1.5 bar and temperatures between 550 and 600 °C. A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used. The catalyst deactivates over time and is therefore continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits. The heat required for the dehydrogenation reaction is provided by heating the catalyst material to temperatures above 700 °C in the regenerator. A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat to achieve these temperatures. Upon its return to the reactor, the catalyst cools again to temperatures below 560 °C. Finally, a system comprising a jet scrubber and cyclones in the head of the reactor is used to remove any dust formed by catalyst attrition. (48)
The Linde-BASF PDH process, of which a schematic representation is shown in Figure 7, uses a Pt–Sn catalyst supported on ZrO2 for dehydrogenating light paraffins isothermally at a temperature of 590 °C. The process shows various similarities with the STAR process, as the reaction feed is diluted with steam and an externally heated fixed bed reactor is used. Three of these reactors operate in parallel, with two in dehydrogenation and one in regeneration mode, ensuring a continuous flow of reaction products. A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step. (37)
3 Thermodynamics of Nonoxidative Alkane Dehydrogenation
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:
However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chatelier’s principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550–750 °C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2–C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions ≥50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8). Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol–1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol–1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol–1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis. The pressure dependence is also shown in Figure 8, lower pressures clearly resulting in higher olefin yields at a given temperature.
The C–H bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than C–C bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor C–H over C–C bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions. An additional complicating factor is that olefins are considerably more reactive than their paraffinic counterparts, which can further lead to unwanted side and secondary reactions. Three types of side reactions can occur, hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization. In hydrogenolysis, the addition of hydrogen into a C–C bond within a paraffin results in the formation of two smaller alkanes. Because hydrogen adatoms and/or CxHy adspecies are required for alkane hydrogenolysis to occur, (57, 58) this reaction is believed to be catalyzed by Pt sites. Cracking also results in the cleavage of a paraffin to form two smaller hydrocarbons, although in this instance no hydrogen is required. Thermal cracking hardly occurs at dehydrogenation reaction conditions, as it requires temperatures of 450–750 °C and pressures of 5–70 bar. This reaction proceeds via the formation of radical intermediates, which rearrange into an alkane and an alkene. Catalytic cracking is different in the sense that it requires a catalyst with Brønsted and Lewis acidity and proceeds via the formation of a carbocation intermediate, albeit it also results in the formation of an alkene and an alkane. (59-61) Isomerization is the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule. For example, during the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, the former may transform to 1- or 2-butene, which may dehydrogenate further to 1–3-butadiene. The rearrangement can take place via a carbocation intermediate formed on a Brønsted acid site, or through an adsorbed species on the active phase of the dehydrogenation catalyst. (62-64) By increasing the temperature, the rates of both C–H and C–C cleavage reactions are increased, and therefore temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield. In short, the balance between dehydrogenation and these side reactions is very complex.
Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design. For instance, cracking reactions are efficiently catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites, while large Pt ensembles also display activity for hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization reactions. Scheme 1 shows an overview of the side reactions that may be catalyzed by Brønsted acid and Pt sites on a typical Pt-based dehydrogenation catalyst. (26)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Examples of the Side Reactions That May Occur When 1-Butene Is Exposed to a Pt/Al2O3 Catalyst: (1) Hydrogenolysis, (2) Thermal Cracking, (3) Catalytic Cracking, and (4) Isomerization
An additional problem is that the high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke. Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity. This is particularly important when the process operates at high alkane conversions, due to the fact that polymerized olefins are believed to be coke precursors, as will be discussed in more detail in section 5.1. Hence, during the selection of the operational conditions in any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion.
Notably, the reaction equilibrium can be shifted to higher paraffin conversions by reducing the partial pressure of the paraffin or by withdrawing the hydrogen produced. As was shown in the previous section, two strategies have been adopted in industry to lower paraffin partial pressure, reducing the pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process). (26, 30) Hydrogen can be removed from the reaction medium by selective hydrogen combustion (SHC), which involves the addition of an oxidant to the reaction feed to burn off the hydrogen formed during dehydrogenation. Relatively mild oxidants, for example, CO2, are preferred, as the use of strong oxidants, like O2, risks also combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products. Through this approach, a considerable amount of heat is generated, which promotes the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. Another method deals with the addition of a solid oxygen carrier (such as ceria) that serves as a source of oxygen for oxidizing the hydrogen formed. The reduced ceria is reoxidized during the regeneration step. (65) Another strategy is to use a membrane permeable to hydrogen to withdraw the latter from the system, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. Nevertheless, as the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, this approach is more suited for the dehydrogenation of isobutene. (66-68)
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of paraffins is related to SHC by the fact that an oxidant is also added to the feed, although in ODH the latter is done to directly oxidize the paraffin to the respective olefin. ODH has some advantages that make it a very attractive alternative to nonoxidative dehydrogenation, including the facts that the reaction is exothermic (propane ODH: ΔH2980 = −117 kJ mol–1) and not equilibrium limited. However, a good control of side reactions, such as cracking and the excessive oxidation of reaction products, is very challenging.
