    Cr Content-Dependent Evolution of Cr Sites
For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2–ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support. (5)Table 3 summarizes the surface density of commonly used redox-active metal oxides on supports. On SiO2-supported Cr catalysts, the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species follows the sequence of grafted Cr6+ → dispersed Cr6+ oxide → microcrystalline Cr3+ → crystalline α-Cr2O3 with increasing Cr loading. (76) α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, yet inactive for catalysis because of its high resistance to reduction and oxidation. (54) Generally, a monolayer Cr coverage is the threshold for the optimal Cr-dependent activity. Below monolayer coverage, the C3H6 yield usually increases with an increase in Cr content; but beyond this threshold, the excess redox Cr species cannot be attached with the support so that unstable Cr species may decompose to nonredox crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles with no activity. (54) An analogous monolayer "threshold" is also known for supported VOx catalysts for the O2–ODHP reaction. (77)

      - Cr3+/Cr2+ species importance for high C3H6 yield
      - Cr coverage and support properties influence structural evolution
      - Loading-dependent evolution of Cr species on SiO2 support
      - Monolayer Cr coverage as optimal threshold for activity

    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The key concepts revolve around how the amount and distribution of chromium on catalyst supports affect the catalyst's structure and performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The main focus is on the evolution of chromium species with increasing loading and its impact on catalytic activity.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address the main aspects of the topic: the loading-dependent evolution of Cr species, the importance of monolayer coverage, and the impact on catalytic activity. The question should encourage a detailed explanation of these concepts.
