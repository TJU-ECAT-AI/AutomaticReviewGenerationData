Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    To verify the feasibility of CO2–ODHP, early screening tests were conducted on metal oxides that are active for DHP and O2–ODHP, including transition metal oxides (Fe2O3 and Cr2O3) and main-group metal oxides (Ga2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2). (51,52) Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 ≥ Cr2O3 ≫ Al2O3 > SiO2 ∼ none. For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2). Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acid–base property, etc.).
