Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (48−57) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (58−72) Notably, owing to the complexity and dynamic behaviors of catalyst structures and configurations, B-based catalysts often exhibit more than one type of dispersion pattern of the active sites. Therefore, understanding the catalytic properties of each type of active site is essential for the future design of B-based ODHP catalysts.
