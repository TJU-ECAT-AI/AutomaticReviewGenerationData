    The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. (25) A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions. (41,53,73) Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>B–O–O–N< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction (Figure 2b). Grant et al. (25) conducted kinetic experiments which revealed that the consumption rate of propane followed the partial order of PO2 and the second-order dependence to PC3H8, which was obviously different from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism over supported VOx catalysts (zero order for O2 and first order for propane). The special kinetic behavior of BN suggested that the oxygen bonded to boron nitride was relatively stable in the presence of propane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the O–O bond created the B–O and N–O species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively. Furthermore, the generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>N–O–CH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene. After the desorption of hydrocarbon species, the hydrogen atom was removed by dioxygen from the surface hydroxyl groups by cleavage of the O–H bond, thus regenerating the active site.
