    The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site. In 2016, Hermans's group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts. For instance, h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a). Moreover, h-BN and BNNT catalysts could maintain a relatively higher propene selectivity with the increase in propane conversion. By contrast, other state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts favored the overoxidation of propane to COx. Notably, the principal byproduct of the ODHP on the BN material was ethene (selectivity of 12%), also a valuable olefin, thus making the ODHP over BN atomically more efficient and profitable and resulting in the release of fewer carbon prints (Figure 2a). Although the product distribution of h-BN and BNNTs was similar, BNNTs exhibited more than 1 order of magnitude higher mass-specific propane consumption rate (molC3H8·kgcat-1·s–1) than h-BN. The rate normalized to the surface area of BNNTs (3.6 × 10–7 molC3H8·m–2 s–1) was about three times higher than that of h-BN (1.1 × 10–7 molC3H8·m–2·s–1). The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP.
