3. Dimensional Understanding of the ODHP Reaction Mechanism over B-Based Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. In the following sections, the experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms will be summarized. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP will also be discussed.
3.1. Surface Reaction Mechanism
Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. (25) Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst, which was evidently different from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism of the traditional metal oxide catalysts. This phenomenon suggested that the oxygen bonded to the boron nitride surface was relatively stable in the presence of propane. The reaction mechanism on >B–O–O–N< active sites started with hydrogen abstraction from the secondary carbon of propane that had been further revealed by DFT calculations. Accordingly, the surface-stabilized propyl intermediate [namely, >N–O–CH(CH3)2] was generated by the cleavage of the O–O bond, creating the B–O and N–O species to accommodate H and secondary propyl radicals, respectively. Thereafter, a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon was abstracted and followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of propene. After the desorption of propene, the >B–O–O–N< active sites were regenerated by cleaving the O–H bond and oxygen extracting hydrogen (Figure 7a).

Under the reaction conditions, the surfaces of BN-based and boron oxide-based catalysts undergo oxygen functionalization, generating BOx active species. Shi et al. (41) further studied how BOx active species participated in the reaction of ODHP using in situ FTIR characterization and isotopic labeling experiments. In situ IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the intensity of B–OH vibration continually weakened with the introduction of O2 to the propane atmosphere. The consumed B–OH could be regenerated by steam treatment. This phenomenon demonstrated that B–OH was an active surface intermediate involved in the reaction network. Isotope labeling experiments discovered that both HDO and D2O were generated when C3H8 and O2 were introduced into the deuterated BNOD catalyst at 530 °C. The H216O and H218O signals also appeared after the catalyst was exposed to 18O2, indicating that two adjacent B–OH were able to dehydrate and reversibly exchange H and O atoms with gas-phase reactants. The exchange process occurred by forming a four-membered ring intermediate, which was then dehydrated to form the B–O–B site. Different from BN, a Langmuir-type dependence on oxygen concentration (0.5) and second-order dependence on propane concentration demonstrated that the molecular oxygen was adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface and that the propane derived from the gas phase directly reacted with the active oxygen species. Therefore, a mechanism could be proposed where B–OH groups react with O2 to generate active species that may further catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propene and water and recover the B–OH groups (Figure 7b). However, Su et al. (79) found that the BN materials could not be oxidized below 800 °C under an O2 atmosphere, indicating that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed B–O species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions. The operando spectroscopy verified that, during the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, the1-D active sites of B–O(H) are formed at the BN edges with the aid of ethane and that the formed B–O sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2.
When the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) with the isolated B active sites of −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 was used for the ODHP reaction, (60) the first-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 was discovered, which was different from that over BN and B/support catalysts. DFT calculations revealed that the reaction behavior of the isolated hydroxyl-functionalized B atoms was significantly influenced by the adjacent Si–OHs. During the ODHP reaction, B–OH captured a proton from propane to form the C3H7 intermediate by crossing a barrier of 1.583 eV. Simultaneously, the B–OH interacted with O2, forming an eight-membered ring transition state (Figure 7c). Then the C3H7 intermediate reacted with the O2H species, and the intermediate underwent H abstraction to afford propene and H2O2. After desorption, H2O2 transformed into H2O and O2 in the practical reaction.
3.2. Gas Radical Reaction Mechanism
The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction (Figure 8a). Theoretically, the cleavage of the C–C bond of propane will generate one C2 and one C1 fragment. If no further reaction exists, the carbon-based selectivity of C2/C1 products will be equal to 2. However, it is widely observed that the practical measured value of C2/C1 is larger than 2, (53,63,64) which implies there must be one or more extra pathways that consume C1 to form C2 products in the ODHP reaction. Wang et al. (108) designed experiments to verify the role of the oxidative coupling of the methane (OCM) reaction into C2 speciation on the h-BN catalyst. It demonstrated that the methyl radicals could effectively couple to form C2 in the presence of oxygen at high temperature, accounting for the high selectivity of C2 species in the ODHP reaction. Using 13C-labeled propane as the reactant, the alkyl radical reaction network was revealed in detail. During ODHP reaction, CH3CH2*CH2, CH3CH2*, and CH3* radicals were formed by the cleavage of C–H and first C–C bonds of propane, respectively, over the BN catalyst. The on-purpose product of propene was synthesized by the subsequent dehydrogenation of CH3CH2*CH2 radical. Meanwhile, the dehydrogenation of CH3CH2* radical played the main role in the formation of C2H4. The methyl formed from the first C–C bond cleavage of propane could be involved in the coupling reaction, CH4 formation, CHxOy formation, and overoxidation to COx reactions. Among these reactions, the oxidative coupling of methyl showed additional contribution to C2-product selectivity in ODHP, leading to a higher yield of C2-products than that of C1-products over the h-BN catalyst.

Under the oxidative reaction conditions of elevated temperatures, it is hard to probe the highly reactive radical species and detect the changes in them. Huang and co-workers (83) used online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to capture the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3·) in the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts, which provided direct evidence to demonstrate the existence of gas-phase radicals. The gas-phase methyl radical signal (m/z = 15) and propene (C3H6, m/z = 42) were observed throughout the ODHP reaction over h-BN catalysts and BOx/SiO2 (Figure 8b). In the control and blank experiments in the presence of a catalyst at room temperature and without a catalyst at elevated temperatures, no radical signal was detected, indicating that the activation of propane as well as the cleavage of the first C–C bond of propane occurred on the surface of B active sites at high temperatures. The amount of various gas-phase components from the SVUV-PIMS spectra (Figure 8c) revealed that higher temperature promoted the formation of C2H4, C2H6, and HCHO, but the content of CH3·, CH4, and COx increased relatively slowly with the elevated temperature. Moreover, no C2H5· and C3H7· radicals were detected. According to the results of the kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations, propane was activated over a B–O pair in a BO3 active site and then the hydrogen was abstracted and transferred to the oxygen of B–O–B, forming a coadsorbed B–C3H7 intermediate. Furthermore, the O2 reacted with the surface O–H by abstracting the hydrogen to form B–HO2. This was followed by the reaction of B–HO2 and B–C3H7 on adjacent BO3 sites, resulting in the formation of H2O2 and propene. After desorption of propene and H2O2 from the surface, H2O2 decomposed to form water, and the BO3 site was regenerated (Figure 8d). Meanwhile, it was also found that the formation of ethene and methyl radicals could occur competitively over either the surface or in the gas phase.
3.3. Reaction Networks of ODHP Reactions with Surface and Gas-Phase Radicals
On the basis of the aforementioned research summary, we have attempted to plot the reaction networks to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as shown in Figure 9. For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3–x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. According to the previous studies, (107,109,110) the B–O–B (derived from BOx-based catalyst) and {BB} (derived from the oxygen functionalization of BN-based catalyst, a type of unsaturated B–B–B units in which the middle B is buried in the sublayer while two ends are exposed) are the basic precursors for the B active site on the catalyst surface. They could convert to the commonly accepted surface-active site of BO· after oxygen functionalization with the formation of the important gas radical ·OOH. On one side, the O2 could be activated on the {BB} surface sites, which is a thermodynamically favorable process to form a peroxo-like >BO–OB< surface species. Then, the BO· surface-active site is generated by the facile O–O bond cleavage by overcoming an energy barrier of 49 kJ mol–1. (109) On the other hand, in parallel, the {BB} surface sites directly hydrolyze to generate B–OH and B–H active species, and then the formed B–H will react with O2 from HOO·, which is the main reactive radical for the gas reaction. However, Wang et al. (107) proposed different viewpoints because the reductive metastable B structure including B–B and B–H could not survive under ODH conditions requiring a sufficient quantity of accessible dioxygen and alkane. It was considered that the abundant thermodynamically stable B–O–B bridges in tricoordinated B2O3 units could be hydrolyzed to generate more B–OH under ODH conditions. The H abstraction of B–OH occurred in the presence of O2 with an energy barrier of 45–55 kcal mol–1. (107) It should be noted that the neighboring Si–OH could form a hydrogen bond with the B–OH to stabilize the transition state and assist the dehydrogenation by triplet O2 with a reduced reaction barrier (36.1 kcal mol–1), which may be responsible for the excellent performance of BS-1 zeolite with the isolated B active sites of −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 used for the ODHP reaction. (60) The highly reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals formed by H abstraction of B–OH by O2 could invoke the dehydrogenation of propane via the surface channel and gas channel, respectively. The aforementioned reaction processes are the initiation stages during which the radical species are generated.

During the ODHP reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane mainly occurs via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. (72) After the first hydrogen of propane is abstracted, on the one hand, a second hydrogen of the formed propyl or isopropyl may be further abstracted by BO· and ·OOH radicals to form propene with a relatively low barrier. On the other hand, a second hydrogen could be abstracted by O2. Meanwhile, a part of propene is formed by the direct cleavage of the C–H bond of propyl and isopropyl radicals. As the main byproduct during the ODHP reaction, ethene is mainly derived from C–C bond cleavage and the coupling reaction of C1 species. The extremely low selectivity of the peroxide byproduct of COx is the most important characteristic of B-based catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Under ODH conditions, the alkyl radical is considered to be an intermediate leading to olefin products, while the alkoxyl radical may evolve into either olefins or deep oxidation products. Therefore, a high alkene selectivity and a low COx selectivity require an efficient way to eliminate the alkoxy radical. Researchers (107,110) found that the tricoordinated B–OH could adsorb the oxygenated radicals under ODH conditions, for example, ·OC3H7 and ·OH, rather than alkyl radicals, for example, ·C3H7, which effectively detained the alkoxy radicals on the surface and freed the alkyl radicals in the gas phase. The formed >B–OC3H7 species were eliminated by the dehydrogenation process under the participation of O2 and eventually converted to C3H6 with B–OH site regeneration. In addition, the latest study by the Lu’s group revealed that the in situ-formed propene under ODHP reactions actively accelerated the parent propane conversion by interacting with ·OOH and ·OC3H7 radicals and generated propene oxide (PO), which was further oxidized to ethene and CO. (111) Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. (55,112) Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design. For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP.
Firstly, reaction conditions are considered to be the crucial factors affecting the surface and radical reactions, and the experimental parameters of partial pressure of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV are commonly considered. Furthermore, catalyst bed configuration is also important to ODHP. Venegas et al. (103) related the contributions of catalyst bed configuration to the observed reactivity of h-BN catalysts. The experiments showed a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of h-BN in the reactor. Meanwhile, the addition of SiC can significantly increase the reactivity, which could be explained by the promotion of gas-phase reactions. The homogeneous dilution of the active BN with inert SiC exhibited better activity than the layered packing of the same amount of BN with SiC. In addition to the discussion of the intrinsic catalytic properties of B-based catalysts, the influences of mass and heat transfer were also investigated with the h-BN catalyst for the ODHP reaction. It was observed that the propane conversion increased with increasing WBN/F0, suggesting that the mass-specific reaction rate tended to decrease with the increasing catalyst weight. When the inner diameter (ID) of the reaction tubes was reduced from 8 to 4 nm, a lower reaction rate was obtained even at higher temperatures. (103) Therefore, the optimal catalyst bed configuration may vary with the B material, reactor dimensions, and gas composition.
The mixed heterogeneous–homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system.
