  <original_paragraph>
    Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. In the following sections, the experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms will be summarized. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP will also be discussed.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address the main aspects of the dual mechanism, including its complexity, the specific types of reactions involved, and the potential synergistic effects. The question should also prompt for a detailed explanation.
