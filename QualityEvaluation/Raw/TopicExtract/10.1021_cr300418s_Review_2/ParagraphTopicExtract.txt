    <integration_process>
      The integration process involved identifying overlapping themes across the solid-state synthesis method and the specific case of copper-doped ceria catalysts. Both topics emphasize the importance of synthesis conditions, characterization techniques, and the relationship between structure and properties. The final extracted topic encompasses these shared elements while maintaining specificity.
