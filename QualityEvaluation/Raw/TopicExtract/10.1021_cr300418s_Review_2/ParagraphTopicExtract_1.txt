Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Copper-doped ceria catalysts were prepared by impregnating ceria (prepared by calcining ceria nitrate in air) with a copper nitrate solution. The particles were dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined in air, at 500 °C, for 4 h. (94) When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed. The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature. The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide.
