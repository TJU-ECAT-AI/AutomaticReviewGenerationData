Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is the thermodynamically stable phase. The method starts with two phases, and the rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases when the particles are smaller and the temperature is higher. There are only a few examples where a substantial effort was made to prove that a doped oxide was prepared. In one example, (93) a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 °C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 °C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3. XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping.
