Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+ → Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+ → Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx. (59) The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops. (55) An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance.
