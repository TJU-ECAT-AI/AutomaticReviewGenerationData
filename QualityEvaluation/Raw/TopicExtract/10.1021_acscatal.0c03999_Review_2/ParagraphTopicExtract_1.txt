Here's the analysis based on the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+ → Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+ → Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx. (59) The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops. (55) An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance.

    <step2_key_concepts>
      - CO2 participation in Cr2+ → Cr3+ and Cr3+ → Cr6+ redox cycles
      - Weak oxidation potential of CO2
      - Inertness of CO2 and difficulty in activation by CrOx
      - Addition of O2 as a co-feed
      - Introduction of promoters to facilitate CO2 activation
    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The main focus is on the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems and the strategies to enhance its performance, particularly through the use of promoters.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address the main challenge (CO2's limitations) and the proposed solution (use of promoters) while also considering the broader context of improving catalytic performance.
