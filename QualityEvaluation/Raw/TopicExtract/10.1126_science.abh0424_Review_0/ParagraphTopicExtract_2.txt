  <original_paragraph>
    Chemical engineering processes are typically governed by multiple unit operations. To minimize the energy consumption and economic cost, researchers face the challenge of integrating multiple steps of reactions and separations. A tandem reaction involves sequential reactions within one condition, presenting an effective scheme for emerging chemical industries (1). On page 1257 of this issue, Yan et al. (2) present a tandem catalyst with porous overcoating structures, In2O3-Pt/Al2O3, for coupling catalytic propane dehydrogenation with selective H2 combustion.
