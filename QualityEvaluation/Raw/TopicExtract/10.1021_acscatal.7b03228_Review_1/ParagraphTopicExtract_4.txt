Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    The following criteria probably apply for any successful SAA catalyst. First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild. High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metal–metal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal. (33) Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal. For example, if one metal forms very strong metal–adsorbate bonds but the other does not, then the former metal will migrate to the surface. (34) For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide. (35) Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy. This probably implies that "structure sensitive" reactions are more likely to be successful. (36)
