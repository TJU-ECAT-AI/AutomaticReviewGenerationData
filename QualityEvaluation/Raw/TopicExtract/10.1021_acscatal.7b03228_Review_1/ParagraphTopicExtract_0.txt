  <original_paragraph>
    An extreme example of a site design second material pathway toward geometric perturbation is the use of single-atom alloys (the smallest possible ensemble). To this end, Sykes and co-workers have demonstrated that Pd atoms embedded in a Cu(111) surface can act as unique sites for the activation of hydrogen and thereby boost activity and selectivity in selective hydrogenation. (28) In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface. (28a) DFT calculations predicted that the barrier for hydrogen dissociation was reduced from 0.4 to 0.02 eV but that the adsorption enthalpy was not strongly affected (−0.35 eV on the alloy but −0.20 eV on Cu(111)). This prediction indicates a break from Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated. (29) Breaking these scaling rules through a geometric effect (changing the active site) allows departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. In agreement with this prediction, the desorption temperature (manifested as the barrier to association—the reverse of the dissociation process) dropped dramatically from 310 K on Cu(111) to about 220 K on 0.01 ML Pd/Cu(111) (and even lower to ∼180 K on 0.1 ML Pd/Cu(111)). Selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene and styrene to ethylbenzene were demonstrated successfully in order to illustrate the advantageous catalytic properties of the Pd@Cu SSA. More recently, Boucher et al. extended this approach to nanoparticles by galvanic replacement of Cu with Pd, demonstrating selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene at a Cu:Pd ratio of 80:1. (30) Similar work presented by Louis and co-workers which examined the selective hydrogenation of butadiene over AuPd catalysts (31) and by Aich et al. which examined the selective hydrogenation of acrolein to allyl alcohol over PdAu catalysts (32) also invoked the idea of single Pd atoms allowing for a much greater selectivity to the desired products, whereas contiguous Pd atoms led to unselective hydrogenation.
