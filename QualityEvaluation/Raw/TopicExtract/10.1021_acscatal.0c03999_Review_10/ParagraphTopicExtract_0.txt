Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield. Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2–ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2–ODHP. (213) In the future, developing a structure–activity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.
