Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

```xml
<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use. Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These materials are discussed in detail hereinafter.
