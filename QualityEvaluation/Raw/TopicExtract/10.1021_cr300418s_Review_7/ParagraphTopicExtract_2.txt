Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Mars–van Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide's surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface). In most cases, the reoxidation of the surface is very fast, and therefore the rate-limiting step is the reaction of the reductant with the surface oxygen. We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction
