    Characterization Methods for Doped Oxides
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
4.1 Introduction
The substitution of a dopant atom in a metal oxide host, even at very small concentrations, can have profound effects on the properties of the host, including alterations in electronic and transport properties, morphology changes, and lower phase transition temperature. Ultimately, when making doped-oxide catalysts, we hope to improve their functional performance. If the performance is improved, we would like to show that the improvement is due to dopant substitution so that we might develop a more general understanding of the connection between dopant–oxide pairing and catalytic activity. The methods of characterization need to answer the following questions. Is the active catalyst a homogeneously doped oxide with some dopant in the surface layer? Are we sure that the dopant did not make very small oxide clusters on the surface? Can we rule out the presence of two phases? Are we sure that catalytic activity is not due to impurities in the precursors? What differences in activity are caused by different methods of preparation of doped oxides with the same nominal composition?
