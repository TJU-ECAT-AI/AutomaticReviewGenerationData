  <original_paragraph>
    It is generally accepted that a doped oxide should have the structure of the host oxide (e.g., Ti-doped ceria should have the fluoride structure of the undoped ceria). Rietveld analysis is used to determine whether doping caused a small shift in the lattice parameter. These are necessary conditions for "proving" that a doped oxide has been prepared. XRD can identify whether or not a single crystalline phase is present to within the resolution of the instruments (typically >1%). Peak widths are fit to the Debye–Scherrer equation to determine crystallite size. Shifts due to substitutional doping are often interpreted using Vegard's rule, which states that there is a linear relationship between the concentration of a substitutional dopant and the change in the lattice parameter. There is no theoretical basis for Vegard's rule, and many violations have been documented. As an added complication, the lattice parameters of small nanocrystals depend on crystallite size, and one is not sure whether the observed lattice parameters shift is due to doping or to the small size of the crystallites.
