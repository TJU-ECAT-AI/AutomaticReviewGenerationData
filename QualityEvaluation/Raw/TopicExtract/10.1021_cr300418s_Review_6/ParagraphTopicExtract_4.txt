    Chemists have lived with uncertainty throughout their history, and the situation described above is not rare nor does it imply that we should abandon using computations. A possibility, which we follow, is to look for situations in which knowledge of simple rules or trends can improve our ability of predicting whether a catalyst or a class of catalysts is promising for a particular reaction. For example, alkane activation catalyzed by doped oxides is fertile ground for this approach. The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the C–H bond. One can compare the activity of different catalysts for this process by calculating the activation energy for C–H bond breaking. This makes the time needed for screening catalysts for this reaction comparable to the time of doing the experiments, which is an important practical consideration. In the case of doped oxide catalysts, there are a number of fundamental, qualitative questions. Among the many possible oxide–dopant combinations, which one has the lowest activation energy for breaking the C–H bond? Can we classify the dopant–oxide pairs in a useful way that might allow us to guess, without elaborate calculations, what catalyst to try for alkane activation? Is there a simple understanding of how a dopant affects catalytic activity? Finally, computations have the advantage that they can easily "make" new materials and explore their catalytic activity. If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them.
