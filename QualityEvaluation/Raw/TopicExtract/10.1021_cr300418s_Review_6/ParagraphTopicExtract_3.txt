Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements. In almost all cases, the surface is modeled by a slab of finite thickness in one direction and periodic in the other two. It is also possible to make small oxide cluster models, which allow the use of more accurate quantum chemistry methods. Experiments on gas-phase clusters (146) and on mass-selected clusters supported on solid surfaces (147-158) show that the catalytic activity of very small clusters depends strongly on their size. Therefore, a calculation using a cluster model has to increase the cluster size until its catalytic properties no longer change with size. If the size becomes too large, one has to resort to DFT. If it is too small, one can do accurate calculations, but the model is inaccurate.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address the main computational methods discussed (DFT and cluster models) and their applications in catalytic systems. The question should also touch on the challenges and considerations when choosing between these methods.
