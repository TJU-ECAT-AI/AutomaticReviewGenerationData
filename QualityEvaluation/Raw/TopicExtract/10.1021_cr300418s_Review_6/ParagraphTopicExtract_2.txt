Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    As we have explained already, the role of a dopant is to disrupt the chemical bonds in the surface of the doped oxide to make either the dopant or the oxygen atoms near the dopant engage more readily (than the undoped oxide) in chemical reactions. By reviewing the existing DFT calculations, we have come up with a tentative classification of the dopant–oxide pairs.
    We call a dopant a low-valence dopant (LVD) when its valence in its own stable oxide is lower than the valence of the cations it substitutes in the host oxide. For example, a La atom substituting a Ce atom in CeO2 is an LVD because lanthanum oxide has the formula La2O3. The chemistry of doped oxides in which the dopant's valence is lower than that of the substituted cation by one is predictable. Their most interesting feature is that they activate the oxygen atoms near them and make them more reactive. The LVDs make the doped oxide a better oxidant than the undoped host oxide, and therefore they promote the first step in the Mars–van Krevelen catalytic oxidation mechanism.
