  <original_paragraph>
    Among the various deposition methods, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is most compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies. The PVD methods utilize line-of-sight deposition to produce a metal overlayer on the target substrate. The controlling parameters of typical PVD synthesis include the rate of metal vapor flux, time of deposition, substrate temperature, and deposition environment such as in vacuum or in the background of selected gases. Common PVD methods include magnetron sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, e-beam sputtering, and physical evaporation of the overlayer metal via thermal filament. Figure 1 shows the typical experimental setup of a metal source for thermal evaporation. The metal source consists of a thin (typically 0.2–0.5 mm) tungsten (W) or tantalum (Ta) wire, which is wrapped around with wire (typically 0.05–0.1 mm) of the metal of interest. The W or Ta wire is connected to the power supply through a UHV feedthrough to a DC or AC power supply for resistive heating. The extremely high melting temperature of the W or Ta filament allows deposition of the metal of interest without contamination from W or Ta. The evaporation filament is typically housed in a stainless steel cylinder, with a small opening at the front face of the cylinder to direct the metal deposition onto the substrate and to prevent the evaporation of metals onto other components in the UHV system. The metal source is gradually heated to the temperature of evaporation and held for a certain amount of time to achieve reproducible deposition of an impurity-free metal overlayer. Such conditioning of the source takes many hours, often at a current or voltage slightly higher than what is used for the metal deposition. The pressure in the UHV system should be 5 × 10–10 Torr or lower during evaporation to prevent the accumulation of background impurities on the bimetallic surface.
