    The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities. ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity; they are discussed in more detail in section (vide infra). Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities. In all cases, the C−H bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step. Note again that ODH, and in particular that of ethane, necessitates relatively high temperatures (above 600 °C), for which homogeneous gas phase reactions can be predominant. It has been proposed that C−H bond activation probably leads to M−alkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b). (98, 103) The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation.
