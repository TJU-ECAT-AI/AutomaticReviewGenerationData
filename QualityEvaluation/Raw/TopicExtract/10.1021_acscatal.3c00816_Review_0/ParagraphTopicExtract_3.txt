Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc. (Figure 1a). (1) According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030 (Figure 1b). (2,3) Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well. Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several new technologies for propylene production, including propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO), and Fischer–Tropsch to olefin (FTO). Especially, PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c).
