  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the core elements present in most questions: the advantages of PDH, its ability to meet growing demand, and its comparison to other methods. I then crafted a comprehensive question that encompasses these aspects while encouraging a detailed response.
