Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2–C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 3–9, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations. We have attempted this comparison focusing on three performance criteria, olefin yield (obtained at the start of the experiment), stability (expressed as the deactivation rate), and the space velocity at which the first two criteria were measured (expressed as WHSV). In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered. The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable). It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source. Also of note is the fact that the performance criteria compared were measured during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which are the reactions that have been researched most intensively.
