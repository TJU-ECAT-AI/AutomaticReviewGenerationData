    <integration_process>
      The integration process involved identifying recurring themes and concepts across all inputs. The focus on thermodynamic stability, structural changes, and their impact on catalytic properties was consistent throughout. Special attention was given to Pt-based systems, which were prominently featured in multiple analyses. The process also involved consolidating similar ideas and ensuring that the final topic encompassed all major aspects discussed in the individual extractions.

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      The integration approach focused on combining the key elements from all generated questions. This included addressing thermodynamic stability, structural changes, reaction conditions, and catalytic properties. Special attention was given to Pt-based systems, which were a common thread across multiple questions. The final question aims to be comprehensive while maintaining specificity to guide a focused discussion.
