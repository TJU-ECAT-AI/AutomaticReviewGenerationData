<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Crystal materials with abundant hydroxyl groups can provide a subtle ambiance to graft metal sites or anchor metal compounds, providing a feasible pathway to fabricate well-tuned materials with various catalytic properties. (117) Controllable incorporation of active compounds on the support can be accomplished by using a hydroxyl anchoring approach (grafting or confining active sites on isolated hydroxyls and/or hydroxyl nests).
