Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Enhancing the metal–support interactions via immobilization of active compounds on well-tailored supports to form stable and well-defined active sites can exert profound effects on catalytic performance and is especially responsible for the activity, selectivity, and stability of solid–gas heterogeneous catalysts. (113−116) Strong metal–support interactions can be realized in both chemical and physical ways (Table 2). For the former, stable chemical bonds are usually established, while the latter adopts physical encapsulation to fix the active compounds.
