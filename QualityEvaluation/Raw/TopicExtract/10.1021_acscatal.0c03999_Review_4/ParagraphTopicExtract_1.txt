  <original_paragraph>
    To establish the correlation between activity and Ga2O3 polymorphs, Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2–ODHP. (121) β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction. Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (1–5 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3.
