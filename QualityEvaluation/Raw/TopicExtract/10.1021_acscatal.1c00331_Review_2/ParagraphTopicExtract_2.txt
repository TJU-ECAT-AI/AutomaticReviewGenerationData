  <original_paragraph>
    Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke. (43) The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction. (62) The similar observation is obtained on several Pt surfaces, such as Pt(111) and Pt(100). (48) Moreover, for a conventional Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen. (22) In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brønsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support. Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. (49) This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature.
