Here's the integrated analysis based on the multiple topic extractions and generated questions:

    <common_themes>
      - Effects of hydrogen cofeed/cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process
      - Impact on coke formation and reduction
      - Influence on catalyst stability
      - Mechanisms of hydrogen's effects on the PDH process
    </common_themes>
    
    <key_concepts>
      - Hydrogen cofeed in PDH process
      - Decreased coke formation rate
      - Increased catalyst stability
      - Energy barrier of propylene dehydrogenation
      - Coke accumulation on catalyst support
      - Changes in acidity and acid site conversion
      - Graphitization of coke
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics and ideas, I identified the recurring themes and key concepts across all inputs. I then combined these elements to create a comprehensive topic that encompasses the main aspects of hydrogen's impact on the PDH process, including its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and the underlying mechanisms.

    <final_extracted_topic>
      The comprehensive effects and mechanisms of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction dynamics in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process.

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the core aspects addressed in each question and ensured that the final question covers all these aspects. The integrated question aims to encompass the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, underlying mechanisms, and their implications for process efficiency.

      <english>How does hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms, considering its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, and what are the implications of these effects on the overall process efficiency and performance?</english>
      <chinese>在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共进料如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理，考虑到它对能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转换和石墨化的影响，这些效应对整体工艺效率和性能有何影响？</chinese>
