    4.3 Reforming of Oxygenates
Selective reforming of oxygenates is a promising way to produce hydrogen for use in fuel cells, and syngas for production of chemicals and fuels, and in upgrading of feedstocks. (256, 258, 260, 347, 348) If the oxygenates are derived from renewable biomass, the reforming process is potentially CO2 neutral, as the CO2 byproduct can be consumed by future biomass growth. Other advantages of oxygenate reforming include low toxicity and low reactivity of the reactants, which are compatible with the current infrastructure for transportation and storage. Table 7 summarizes selected reactor studies of oxygenate reforming over supported catalysts; selected UHV studies of reforming over bimetallic surfaces are listed in Table 3.
