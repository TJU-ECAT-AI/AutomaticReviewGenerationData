    Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity
The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a). The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics. By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d).
