V oxide catalysts
As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latter’s effects on reducibility, acid–base properties and dispersion24,65. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOx–support interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures. DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67. Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2–ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69). The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4. In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acid–base bifunctionality70. If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12. Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73. A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support. In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74. Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75. This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reaction–regeneration cycles (64 h on stream). Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust.
In and Ga oxides
The metal centres in In oxides can undergo reduction (InIII to In0) but cannot be reoxidized by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that these catalysts operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway37,38,76. Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M = Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3–CeO2 mixture78. By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties. In a separate study, fresh and unreduced In2O3/Al2O3 undergoes induction over 3 h, during which it increases in activity as the concentration of In0 sites increases, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies38. Catalytic activity and TPR data suggest that the initial generation and stabilization of optimal surface concentrations of In0 species are crucial for activity. Consistent with these findings, the prereduced catalyst did not require an induction period and had similar C3H6 selectivity and only slightly less conversion than the fresh catalyst sample38. Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acid–base properties.
Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80). Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity (30%) but, after 10 min, the selectivity decreases to less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the material81. Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface through the RWGS reaction16. The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 in particular was attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding, such that the alkane is displaced to basic catalyst sites. In general, when Ga2O3 is on a support and exposed to CO2, it binds C3H8 too weakly to rapidly effect its conversions. The competitive binding is not observed for Ga2O3/TiO2 under low partial pressures of CO2 but is dominant at all pressures when Al2O3 or ZrO2 are used as supports. Thus, the role of CO2 over Ga-based catalysts is largely dependent on the support. So, we can say that Ga oxides outperform Cr and V oxides, but the unsupported materials still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking and the supported materials bind CO2 too strongly relative to alkanes.
CO2-ODH over bimetallic and carbide catalysts
The electronic and catalytic properties of a transition metal can be modified by alloying it with C or another metal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bimetallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent metals, presenting an opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84. Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O scission87. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation88,89. Thus, supporting catalysts on CeO2 should promote the activation of CO2, while the choice of the bimetallic should influence selectivity43,90,91. The conversion of C2H6 has been investigated over CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts Co3Pt1, Co3Mo1, Ni3Mo1 and Fe3Ni1 (note that, throughout this Review, the formulae denote element ratios and do not describe small clusters of metals). Experiments were conducted at 823 K, a temperature at which both CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur. In this way, it was possible to identify the systems that selectively break C–H bonds of C2H6 to produce C2H4, and the less desirable systems that break C–C bonds to produce CO as the only carbonaceous product92. Flow reactions over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective C–H cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2, motivating investigations into how FexNiy active sites bind CO2 and C2H6, and favour C–H scission to afford high C2H4 selectivity93.
CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts
In the following sections, we use the CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as a case study to illustrate the importance of combining catalytic measurements with in situ characterization and DFT calculations. This will be supplemented with discussion of CO2-ODH of other light alkanes over bimetallic and carbide catalysts.
Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity
The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a). The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics. By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d).
