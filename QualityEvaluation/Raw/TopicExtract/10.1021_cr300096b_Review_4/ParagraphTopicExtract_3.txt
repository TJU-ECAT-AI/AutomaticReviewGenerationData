    CO and H2 Chemisorption
One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification. The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites. However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.
