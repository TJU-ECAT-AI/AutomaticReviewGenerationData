<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    In this paper, the design and construction of B active sites in different dimensions were systematically summarized. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of the surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the process of ODHP over B-based catalysts were discussed. It was recognized that the catalytic mechanisms on the potential active sites of tricoordination B species with different dimensional geometric configurations deepened the understanding of B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provided effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.
