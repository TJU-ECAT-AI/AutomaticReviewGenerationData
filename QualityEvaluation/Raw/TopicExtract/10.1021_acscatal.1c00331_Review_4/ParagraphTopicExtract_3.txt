    In summary, coke deposition is a crucial issue for the commercial Pt-based catalysts, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth has an apparent importance for coke formation. Although there are several models available, none of them could resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. The cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are the verified effective methods to prevent coke formation. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Furthermore, hydrogens also aggregate the degree of coke graphitization which requires a higher regeneration temperature. The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability. However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst. Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity.
