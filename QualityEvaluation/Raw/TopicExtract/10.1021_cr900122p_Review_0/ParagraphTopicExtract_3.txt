  <original_paragraph>
    The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades. Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane → acrylic acid, butane → maleic anhydride, xylene → phtalic anhydride.... The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride. Butane oxidation into maleic anhydride corresponds to a 14-electron oxidation process and involves several key stages: formation of butenes, then butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, which is then subsequently converted into maleic anhydride (Scheme 5a). (90, 94)
