Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    C−H bond activation is in fact a ubiquitous process in heterogeneous catalysis. It involves various types of mechanisms and intermediates. C−H bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving C−H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates. The review is divided into two main sections focusing on the C−H bond activation on oxide materials and related systems (section ) and on well-defined organometallic complexes supported on oxide materials (section ). Section is subdivided into four parts describing C−H bond activation on bulk oxides, bulk metal halides, supported transition-metal oxides, and metal-exchange zeolites.
