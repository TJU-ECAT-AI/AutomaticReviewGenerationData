    <integration_process>
      To synthesize these topics, I identified the overarching theme of C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, with a specific focus on isolated metal centers on oxide materials. I then incorporated the industrial application of selective alkane oxidation, particularly the butane to maleic anhydride conversion, as a key example. Finally, I integrated the mechanistic aspects, including the Mars van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction processes.

      To create a comprehensive question, I combined the key aspects from all inputs, including the focus on isolated metal centers, the mechanisms of C-H bond activation, and the industrial application of selective alkane oxidation. The question is designed to encourage a response that covers both the fundamental aspects and practical applications of the topic.

      <english>How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?</english>
