    2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. (10)
