Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    The reverse Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism proposed in 1934 is a widely acknowledged mechanism to describe the kinetics of the propane dehydrogenation process, dividing the whole process into three parts: (i) dissociative adsorption of the alkane, where one hydrogen atom is eliminated; (ii) extraction of the β-H from the adsorbed species along with the formation of H2 and a C–C double bond; and (iii) desorption of the alkene and H2. (31) However, whether the dissociative adsorption process or the extraction of the β-H is the rate-controlling step of PDH process remains to be confirmed. (32−36)

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address both the mechanism itself and the uncertainty about the rate-controlling step. The question should encourage a detailed explanation of the process and prompt discussion about the ongoing research into determining the rate-controlling step.
