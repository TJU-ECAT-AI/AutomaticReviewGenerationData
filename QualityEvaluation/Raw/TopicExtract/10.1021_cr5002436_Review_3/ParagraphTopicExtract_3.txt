Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium–magnesium mixed oxides. (199, 200)
