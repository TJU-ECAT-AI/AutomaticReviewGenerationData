      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the key components present in all inputs: DFT calculations, experimental validation, catalyst structure-activity relationships, and implications for catalyst design. I then formulated a question that addresses these aspects while covering the range of molecules studied and the specific catalytic systems involved.
