    Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of C═C bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt–3d–Pt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt–3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3d–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on Pt–Ni–Pt(111). These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt–3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.

      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address the main components of the topic: the theoretical approach (DFT calculations), the experimental verification, and the implications for catalyst design. The question should also cover the range of molecules studied and the key factors influencing hydrogenation activity.
