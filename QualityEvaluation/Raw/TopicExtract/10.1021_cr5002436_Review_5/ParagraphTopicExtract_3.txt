  <original_paragraph>
    Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides. The so-called Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, C–H cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2a–g. (286) Notably, both C–H cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)
