  <original_paragraph>
    As discussed in section 3.1.1.3, the nature of the support has a crucial role in affecting metal dispersion and preserving redox Cr species; therefore, it strongly influences catalytic performance in CO2–ODHP. In addition to the aforementioned mesoporous silica and various metal oxides, zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. (138−140) To selectively activate C–H bond rather than C–C bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites. (22) Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment (22) and steaming treatments at temperatures. (141,142) Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount (143) and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brønsted acid sites. (144) Zeolites that have been introduced as a support include Beta zeolite, (22) HZSM-5 (141) and phosphorus-modified HZSM-5, (144) HZSM-48, (145,146) and boron-containing MFI. (147)
