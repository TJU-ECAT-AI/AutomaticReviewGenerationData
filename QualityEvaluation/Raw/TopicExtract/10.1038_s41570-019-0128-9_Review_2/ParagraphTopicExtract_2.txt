Here's the analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b). Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.5–4.0 nm. The existence of Fe–Ce bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93. The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f).
