Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    As one of the most important building blocks for the chemical industry, the demands of propene have dramatically increased in recent years. (1) The conventional routes of obtaining propene are mainly related to stream or catalytic cracking of downstream products of the petroleum industry, which are extremely energy intensive with low selectivity. With the large-scale Shale gas discovery worldwide, (2−4) the abundance of light alkanes including methane, ethane, and propane open new opportunities to propene production. The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8 ↔ C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry. PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298° = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 °C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature. The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively. Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company. (1) Polymer-quality propylene can be obtained from Oleflex technology. The regeneration of the catalyst in Oleflex proceeds via combustion of cokes with a chlorine-air mixture. Chromium oxide is another major industrial catalyst of PDH applied in Catofin process from Lummus. The chromium oxide is generally supported on alumina. One disadvantage of chromium oxide catalyst is the toxicity, which potentially causes issues with regard to safety and post-treatment. Except for platinum and chromium oxide, there are a bunch of other materials which are also investigated as PDH catalysts, including Fe, (5−7) Co, (8,9) Ru, (10) Rh, (11) VOx, (12,13) WOx, (14) GaOx, (15,16) and ZrOx. (17−19) Although these catalyst candidates show excellent activity in a laboratory test, they are still not industrially implemented.
