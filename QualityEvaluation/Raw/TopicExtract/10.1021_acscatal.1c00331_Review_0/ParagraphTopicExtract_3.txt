  <original_paragraph>
    Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. (20,21) However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1. The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke. Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial. For example, the duration of the regeneration is the same as dehydrogenation in Catofin technology. Another side effect of coke removal is that the catalyst could agglomerate and lose activity under harsh conditions during regeneration. Therefore, it is urgent to find the effective ways to reduce coke during PDH.
