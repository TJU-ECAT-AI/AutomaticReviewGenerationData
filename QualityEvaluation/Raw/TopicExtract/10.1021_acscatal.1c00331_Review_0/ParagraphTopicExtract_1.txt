Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Recently, there were several excellent reviews which provide a comprehensive description of light alkane activation including propane dehydrogenation. (21,35−37) Although these articles supplied a solid ground to understand the C–H bond activation on metal or metal oxide catalysts, the coke formation is not a particular focus in these articles compared with the reaction mechanism, the nature of the active site, catalyst design, and so on. However, the broad subjects covered in these reviews limited the contents associated with coke formation, leading to a lack of in-depth analysis. Overall, there is still an absence of an updated and systematic account of coke formation on Pt catalysts, which has an apparent importance on reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.
