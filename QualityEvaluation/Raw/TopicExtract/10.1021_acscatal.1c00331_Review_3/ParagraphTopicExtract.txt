  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To create a unified question, I combined the key elements from all generated questions, ensuring that all critical aspects of the topic were addressed. The approach focused on incorporating the various pore structure characteristics, their effects on coke formation and accommodation, and their impact on overall PDH performance. Additionally, I included the aspect of catalyst design implications to encourage a more comprehensive exploration of the topic.
