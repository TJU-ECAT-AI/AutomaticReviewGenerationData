Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation. (96) The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke. Moreover, the pore size has a direct effect on performance of PDH. The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support. (97) The simulation of the effect of the pore structure of the support on coking formation and deactivation shows that the structure of the pore could affect the coke accommodation. A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes. (60)
