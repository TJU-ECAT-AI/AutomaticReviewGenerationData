Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110] Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a). A similar 3-segment dependence of the PDH rate on the Ga/Al ratio was observed on samples with a Si/Al ratio of 28 (Figure 9a). TOFAl on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y) increased almost linearly up to a Ga/Al ratio of 0.55, before declining at higher Ga/Al ratios (Figure 9a). These trends are in general agreement with the results reported by Bell and co-workers (Figure 6h, Si/Al = 16.5)[76] and Lercher and co-workers (Figure 5a, Si/Al = 50).[77] It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To formulate a comprehensive question, we need to address the key aspects of the topic: the relationship between gallium loading (Ga/Al ratio), zeolite composition (Si/Al ratio), and catalytic activity (TOF) in PDH reactions.
