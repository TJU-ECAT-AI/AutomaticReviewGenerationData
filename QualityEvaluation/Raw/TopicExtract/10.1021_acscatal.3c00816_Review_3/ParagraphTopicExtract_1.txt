    The encapsulation of metal sites within zeolites along with their crystallization (i.e., direct synthesis procedure) is promising to avoid the superficial metal species in postsynthesis procedure. However, the time-scale mismatch between the fast metal precipitation and the slow zeolite crystallization still causes challenges for effective encapsulation (Figure 5a). (22) To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 °C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 °C can reduce the crystallization time to ∼2 min. Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace. In comparison, the Sn species were fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage. Ultraviolet–visible light diffuse reflectance (UV–vis DR) spectra reveal that the Sn species initially transform into amorphous SnO2, which subsequently transform into the Td Sn species within the zeolite framework and help improve the Pt dispersion. When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from ∼4 nm to ∼1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of ∼65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.
