3.3. Support Modification
The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).

3.3.1. Acidity Adjustment
PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for C–H activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to C–C cracking and deep dehydrogenation. (5,6,148) Al2O3 as a conventional support for many catalytic processes has already been applied to commercial propylene production due to its high specific surface area, excellent chemical stability, and thermodynamic stability for active compound dispersion. (149,150) However, the inappropriate acidity of Al2O3 could lead to hydrogenolysis and polymerization reactions, inducing coke accumulation. The introduction of an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal is an effective approach to balance the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support and further inhibit catalytic deactivation. (151) Rimaz et al. regulated the acid property of Pt–Ge/Al2O3 catalysts by introducing Ca. (152) NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was carried out to investigate the effect of Ca on the acid properties of the synthesized catalysts and indicated that the amounts of acid centers (strong, medium, and weak) decreased with the incorporation of Ca into the Al2O3 support. High propylene selectivity (98.5% at 873 K) and catalytic stability were obtained due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3, which were responsible for side reactions conducive to the formation of coke. The deactivation constant of propane conversion decreased from 0.22 to 0.05 h–1, while an increasing residual activity was observed along with the introduction of the Ca promoter.
As for zeolites, the Lewis acid sites are preferable for propane dehydrogenation, while the Brønsted acid sites are inductive factors in catalyzing cleavage reactions. In most aluminosilicate zeolites, extraframework cations are needed to balance the negative charges of [AlO4] units. When the extraframework cations are hydrogen ions, the Brønsted acid sites are generated. Thus, dealumination could be an effective method to reduce the Brønsted acid sites of zeolite supports while creating hydroxyl nests to anchor active sites into the zeolite framework. (100) In parallel to the dealumination, the ion-exchange method and the addition of promoters (such as K, Na, Ca, Zn, and Mg) can also help neutralize the Brønsted acid sites. (153−156) Gao et al. applied a mild alkaline treatment process on a Zr–Al–Beta zeolite to regulate their active sites and found that the Brønsted acid sites were weakened significantly by alkali metal cations. (154) Analogously, Ponomaryov et al. added a large amount of NaCl in the impregnation process of a Pt catalyst and then erased the excess part by washing the calcined catalyst, which efficiently suppressed the zeolite acidity. The prepared Na-modified Pt catalyst exhibited increased catalytic durability and a decreased deactivation rate from 0.175 to 0.078 h–1 compared to the non-Na sample. (156)
Generally, adjusting the acid property of the catalyst support by reducing the acidity or changing the acid type can significantly improve the catalytic stability and selectivity toward propylene. However, this strategy may also cause a reduction of catalytic activity. Hu et al. demonstrated that the Brønsted acid sites can play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of CrOx/ZSM-5. (157) A series of Na+ doping experiments were carried out to eliminate the Brønsted acid sites of H-ZSM-5. The activity of the CrOx/ZSM-5 catalyst decreased obviously with the increase of the Na+ doping. Besides, C3H8-TPD indicated that the C3H8 desorption signal of this catalyst also decreased obviously after the Na+ doping. Further investigations thus must be performed to consummate this strategy.
3.3.2. Morphology and Porosity Regulation
For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration. (158−161) Diffusion limitations imposed by various supports are a bottleneck to achieve stable catalytic activity and also can induce overreaction of the product, leading to low selectivity and further deactivation of catalysts. Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures.
Mesoporous SiO2 and Al2O3 are quintessential classes of supports that are widely utilized in both research and industrial applications on account of their excellent hydrothermal stabilities and large surface areas. Designing oxide supports with particular morphologies is an effective way to further facilitate mass transport. Sheet-shaped Al2O3 was synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal process in which the key step to control the sheetlike morphology is the formation of the shaped boehmite (AlO(OH)) precursor with the assistance of urea, which is utilized to anchor Co2+ species for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. (162) These nanosheets with relatively thin thickness provided a large external surface to expose active Co2+ sites, allowing efficient mass transport and low diffusion limitation. The prepared Co–Al2O3 catalysts exhibited high stability and catalytic selectivity toward propylene (>97%). Similarly, single-atom Co supported on SiO2 nanomeshes (Co SAs/SiO2-NMs), synthesized by applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a soft template, was devised to boost nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, as shown in Figure 8a. (163) The prepared Co SAs/SiO2-NMs exhibited higher propylene selectivity (95%) and higher activity (TOF = 196 h–1), compared to the common mesoporous SiO2-supported catalyst (83% selectivity and TOF = 49 h–1) on account of the sufficient contact of the active sites with the substrates in the nanomesh structure (Figure 8b,c).
Traditional microporous zeolites are outstanding supports for supported metal catalysts due to their thermal stability, chemical stability, and large internal surface area. However, when the reactants and products have similar or larger dimensions than the micropores of zeolites, the narrow channels of microporous zeolites would impose a significant restriction on the mass transport, limiting further applications in catalytic fields. (164) Fabricating nanosized and particularly morphological microporous zeolites could be effective approach to reduce the diffusion length. Nanosized zeolites exhibit high diffusion efficiency due to the short internal diffusion length. (165) Nevertheless, with decreasing zeolite crystal size, lower crystallinity follows. (166) The nonuniformity of the zeolite surface negatively influences the diffusion of molecules adsorbed on the surface due to the high surface barrier. Therefore, it is a challenge to balance the diffusion length and the crystallinity. Earlier, a finned zeolite for enhancement of the mass transport property was synthesized through the epitaxial growth method. (167) Pt–Zn encapsulated in this finned MFI zeolite catalyst was designed for the PDH reaction, exhibiting high catalytic stability on account of its high diffusion efficiency, lower surface barrier, and easier active site accessibility. (168) Different-sized nanozeolites (100, 200, and 400 nm) were also prepared for contrast, among which PtZn@S-1-100 (100 nm zeolite) exhibited irregular surface and low crystallinity differing from others, as shown in Figure 8d. The intracrystalline diffusion and surface barrier of propane were quantified by the intelligent gravimetric analyzer (IGA) (Figure 8f,g), indicating that the surface barrier increased with decreasing crystal size (Figure 8e), and the finned zeolite exhibited the most efficient mass transfer. Moreover, the accessibility of Pt–Zn clusters was characterized by XPS depth profiling via detection of the Pt amount after the same and proper Ar-ion sputtering times, indicating that the Pt–Zn@S-1-Fin catalyst possessed the easier active site accessibility as well.
Traditional mesoporous zeolites possess high diffusion ability and generally low acidity, which give them great potential as competent PDH supports. (169,170) Pt–Ga alloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15 were designed as an active and stable catalyst for PDH. (171) Mesoporous SBA-15 increased the dispersion of Pt–Ga nanoparticles and inhibited the further growth of those particles. The Pt–Ga/SAB-15 catalyst with a Pt/Ga molecular ratio of 1:1 exhibited high propane conversion (up to 60%) and selectivity toward propylene (98.2%), even obtaining a propane conversion of 51.6% and a propylene selectivity of 99.5% after 25 h in the PDH stream. However, the amorphous channels of traditional mesoporous zeolites have low hydrothermal stability and weak interactions to fix active compounds, severely limiting their applications in industrial propylene production.
Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at the micro and meso levels exhibit fast transport and relatively high hydrothermal stability, combining catalytic properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites. (172) Applying these hierarchical zeolites provides an effective solution to mass transport limitations and an ideal circumstance to form strong interactions between zeolites and active catalytic phases. Several strategies have been developed to synthesize hierarchical zeolites, which can be mainly summarized as top-down methods and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods are applied to develop hierarchical zeolites via post-treatment procedures (etching away a part of the zeolite through dealumination and desilication or recrystallizing the zeolite crystal), while bottom-up methods usually utilize templates as mesoporogens, including soft templates (surfactants, polymers, and organosilanes) and hard templates (carbon materials, polymers, and biological materials), to develop hierarchical structures during the zeolite synthesis process. Wang et al. designed a series of Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 catalysts in which bimetallic Pt–Sn nanoparticles were confined in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized by a desiliconization treatment in NaOH solution with appropriate concentration under mild conditions (Figure 8h). (173) The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of this zeolite exhibited typical adsorption behavior for a hierarchical structure with a representative type-IV isotherm and H3-type hysteresis loop (Figure 8i), while the morphological images of the ZSM-5 zeolite obtained by treatment using 0.8 mol/L NaOH solution were revealed by SEM (Figure 8j). The Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by wetness impregnation utilizing Bu3SnH and Pt(COD)Me2 as precursors with the subsequent direct reduction process. The prepared Pt–Sn/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst showed high catalytic performance (an initial propane conversion of 46% and a 98% selectivity to propylene) with excellent single-pass stability (deactivation rate ≈ 0.017 s–1) and cycling stability. In another work, hierarchical titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1)-nanosheet-supported Pt catalysts were prepared for nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation. (174) These 2D M-TS-1 zeolites were synthesized utilizing a diquaternary ammonium surfactant template (C22–6–6Br2) that was prepared following the reported procedure, (94) while other zeolites (2D M-ZSM-5, 2D M-Silicalite-1, 3D C-ZSM-5, and 3D C-TS-1) were also synthesized for contrast (“C” stands for “conventional” while “M” stands for “multilamellar”). The SEM images revealed the different morphologies of the prepared zeolites (Figure 8k), while the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms along with the corresponding pore size distributions extracted from the adsorption branch revealed the textural properties (Figure 8l,m). All of the 2D zeolites possessed microporous and mesoporous structures, while 3D zeolites only had microporous structures. Besides, the 2D zeolites exhibited relatively high external surface areas and volumes compared with their 3D analogues. The 2D Pt-TS-1 catalyst exhibited the highest alkene selectivity and long-term stability, with no significant catalytic deactivation in long-term stability tests, due to fast mass transport among zeolite-supported catalysts.
In summary, traditional microporous zeolites with high thermal stability, chemical stability, and large internal surface area are outstanding supports for the PDH reaction. However, in the PDH process, the diffusion limitation becomes obvious due to their small pores. To lower the diffusion limitation, mesoporous and hierarchical zeolites are utilized as promising substitutions for traditional microporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites with amorphous structure can contribute to low hydrothermal stability in the PDH process. Besides, the interaction between the active sites and mesoporous zeolite is usually weak, leading to sintering of the active compounds. The complicated synthesis process along with the costly mesoporogens will restrain the industrial application of hierarchical zeolites. Thus, it is still urgent to exploit new synthetic routes and cheap templates.
