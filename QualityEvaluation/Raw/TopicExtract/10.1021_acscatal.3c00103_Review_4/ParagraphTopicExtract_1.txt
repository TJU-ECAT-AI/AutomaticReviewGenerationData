  <original_paragraph>
    The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address both the impact of physicochemical properties and the strategies for support modification. The question should encourage a detailed explanation of how these properties affect catalyst performance and what methods can be used to modify supports.
