  <original_paragraph>
    The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).
