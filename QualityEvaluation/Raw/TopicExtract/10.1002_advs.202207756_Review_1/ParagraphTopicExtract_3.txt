  <original_paragraph>
    Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structure–activity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 °C). Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. At this point, Ga in the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is typically at its highest oxidation state, that is, +3. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature before the feed is introduced. Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH. The patent and academic literature in the 1970s and 1980s focused largely on the activity and product distribution,[105-107] rather than the structure of the active center, which was likely due to the lack of in situ characterization with sufficient structural detail or spectral resolution.
