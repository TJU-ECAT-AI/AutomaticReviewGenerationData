Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (3−4 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242) This reaction is fast, with rates of 800−1200 h−1, and is slightly selective for terminal C−H bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis−trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d).
