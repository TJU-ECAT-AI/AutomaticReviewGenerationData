Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230) Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15c−e), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233) Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving C−H bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metal−alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228) A direct one-step reaction pathway is highly disfavored (Ea > 65 kcal mol−1), because it involves a four-center transition state with a carbon in the β-position (Scheme 15e). (227)
