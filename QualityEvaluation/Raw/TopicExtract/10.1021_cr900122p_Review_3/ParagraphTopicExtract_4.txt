Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Surface metal alkylidene species are typically formed via decomposition of bis-alkyl intermediates via α-H abstraction, (246) and the reverse step corresponds to the C−H bond activation of an alkane onto a M═C bond. (247-250) Evidence for this process has been obtained in the metathesis of alkane (CH3CH2R) on various well-defined metal neopentyl neopentylidene species (M = Ta, (251, 252) Mo, (253, 254) W, (255) and Re (254)) through the formation of cross-metathesis products with the following selectivity tBuCH3 > tBuCH2CH3 > tBuCH2CH2R, while the coupling product, tBuCH2CH2CH2R, is not detected (Table 1, entries 1−9). Note that the formation of these products requires neopentyl neopentylidene surface species and an alkane of general structure RCH2CH3. This implies that both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene ligands are important and that β-H transfer is probably a key step. These products probably result from a stepwise mechanism involving known elementary steps of molecular organometallic chemistry (Scheme 19, R1 = R2 = tBu): (i) C−H bond activation of RCH2CH3 on the metal alkylidene, thus forming an intermediate with three pendant alkyl ligands [M(CH2tBu)2(CH2CH2R)], (247-250) of which one has a β-H; alternative mechanisms are possible involving the replacement of the alkyl ligand via σ-bond metathesis or the formation of an alkylidyne ligand prior to C−H bond activation (Scheme 19a); (ii) decomposition of this intermediate via α-H abstraction leading to tBuCH3 and a neopentylidene alkyl intermediate [M(═CHtBu)(CH2CH2R)] (Scheme 19b); (iii) further decomposition via β-H abstraction, generating neopentylidene hydride intermediates [M(═CHtBu)(H)] and RCH═CH2; (iv) disproportionation of these intermediates via [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, which yields two sets of products [M(═CHR)(H)]/tBuCH═CH2 and [M(═CH2)(H)]/tBuCH═CHR; (v) subsequent alkene insertion into the metal alkylidene hydride intermediates, C−H bond activation, and decomposition, generating [M(═CHR)(CH2R)] and [M(═CH2)(CH2R)] along with the cross-metathesis products tBuCH2CH3 and tBuCH2CH2R (Scheme 19c).
