Here's the integrated analysis based on the provided input:

```xml
<integrated_analysis>
  <synthesized_topic_extraction>
    <common_themes>
      - Surface-supported metal hydride species (zirconium and thorium)
      - Catalytic activity in H/D exchange reactions
      - C-H bond activation mechanisms
      - Reactivity towards alkanes (particularly CH4)
      - Stepwise reaction pathways
    </common_themes>
    
    <key_concepts>
      - Structure and composition of supported metal hydrides
      - Reactivity and selectivity in H/D exchange
      - σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis
      - Chain walking mechanism
      - cis-trans isomerization
      - Surface metal alkylidene formation
      - Cross-metathesis of alkanes
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      The integration process involved identifying recurring themes across all inputs, such as the focus on supported metal species and their catalytic activity in H/D exchange and C-H activation. Key concepts from each analysis were combined to create a comprehensive view of the catalytic systems and mechanisms discussed. The process also involved bridging the gap between different supported metal species (zirconium and thorium) and extending to surface metal alkylidene reactions to provide a broader perspective on C-H activation chemistry.

    <final_extracted_topic>
      Catalytic mechanisms and reactivity of surface-supported metal species in C-H bond activation, H/D exchange, and alkane metathesis reactions

  </synthesized_topic_extraction>

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      The final question was formulated by combining elements from all individual questions, ensuring coverage of the different metal species, their preparation, reactivity, and mechanistic aspects. The question was broadened to encompass both H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions while maintaining specificity on key mechanistic steps and product formation.

    <final_generated_question>
      <english>Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.</english>
