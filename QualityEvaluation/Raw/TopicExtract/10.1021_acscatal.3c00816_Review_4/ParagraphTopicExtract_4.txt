  <original_paragraph>
    Apart from these silicate and aluminosilicate zeolites, there are also a few PDH systems based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. Fei et al. reported that PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (∼70–95%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (∼40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield. (142) O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions. (56) Similar to the above-described PtSn/ZSM-5 systems (132,133) the role of Sn in PtSn/SAPO-34 was understood by modification of the Pt sites' electronic density and transfer of coke deposits from Pt to support. (56) It should be noted that stable and abundant framework P atoms are one unique feature of such a class of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. In this context, the highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides may be constructed based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, which potentially improve the PDH performance, especially in propylene selectivity, compared to the metal/oxide sites.
