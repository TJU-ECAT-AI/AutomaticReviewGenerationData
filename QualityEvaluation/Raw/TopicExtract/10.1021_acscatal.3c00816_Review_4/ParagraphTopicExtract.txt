    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics, I identified the recurring themes across all inputs, focusing on the preparation, characterization, and performance of zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions. I then broadened the scope to include the comparison between different zeolite types, incorporating the information on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites to provide a more comprehensive overview of the topic.
