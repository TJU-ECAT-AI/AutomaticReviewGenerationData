    3.2. BEA Zeolite-Based Catalysts
Similar to MFI materials, BEA topologic zeolites can also be synthesized under a wide range of SAR values, which are another typical support for PDH catalysts. De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of Pt–Zn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction. Various Zn species (including Zn2+, Zn(OH)+, (Zn-O-Zn)2+, (Zn-(O-Zn)n)2+ and ZnO nanoparticles) may exist after the ion-exchange process, and the different Zn statuses largely depend on the zeolite topologies. In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU). The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of ∼30% and a propylene selectivity of ∼90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 °C, undiluted propane).
