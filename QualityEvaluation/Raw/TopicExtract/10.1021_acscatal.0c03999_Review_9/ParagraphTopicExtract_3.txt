Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Different metal-containing zeolites, such as MFI (19,35,36,178,180−183,195−199) or BEA, (18,182,200,201) have been widely studied for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts. (36,182,183,199,202,203) An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 °C. (180−183) Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 °C.
