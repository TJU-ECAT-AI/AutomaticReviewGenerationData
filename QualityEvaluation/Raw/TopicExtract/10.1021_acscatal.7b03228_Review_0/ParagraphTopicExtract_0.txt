  <original_paragraph>
    Interest in transition-metal alloys as opposed to monometallic catalysts has grown in the years following the inspiring work of John Sinfelt. The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another. One of the early themes of the Sinfelt work was the invocation of reaction ensembles to explain differences in hydrogenolysis behavior between monometallic and bimetallic systems. (1) However, it was also recognized from the beginning that perturbation of reactivity through alloying involved both geometric effects involving creation of specific reaction ensembles (atomistic sites) and electronic effects due to changes in electron density and bonding due to charge transfer and hybridization effects in alloying. For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration. This perspective will comment upon the interplay between the two effects and potential for exploiting geometric effects in alloying.
