Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

    Intramolecular C−H bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic C−H bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). (66, 279, 280) More recently, it was shown that C−H bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene. The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the C−H bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction).
