    <common_themes>
      - Intramolecular C-H bond activation
      - Deactivation of supported catalysts
      - Alkene polymerization catalysts (lanthanides and actinides)
      - Alkene metathesis catalysts (silica-supported Re-based)
      - Formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes
      - β-H transfer process

      - Intramolecular C-H bond activation mechanisms
      - Catalyst deactivation pathways
      - Specific deactivation processes for different catalyst types
      - Impact on catalyst performance and longevity
      - Allylic C-H bond activation
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics and ideas, I identified the recurring themes and concepts across all inputs. I then combined these elements to create a comprehensive topic that encompasses the main focus of the document while maintaining specificity. The integration process involved merging similar concepts and ensuring that all key aspects of the deactivation mechanisms for both alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts were included.

    <final_extracted_topic>
      Mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with emphasis on lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems

  </synthesized_topic_extraction>

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To create a comprehensive question, I combined elements from all generated questions, ensuring that it covers the main aspects of the synthesized topic. The final question addresses the core concept of intramolecular C-H bond activation, its role in catalyst deactivation, and prompts for a comparison between different catalyst types while also considering the broader implications for catalyst performance.
