Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2–ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane. (150−153) Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived Mg–Fe oxides. (154) Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived Fe–Mg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2–ODHP. Noteworthily, the absence of H2 from the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.
