Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst. (252) Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31). In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated C–H activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process. Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction. By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene. These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.
