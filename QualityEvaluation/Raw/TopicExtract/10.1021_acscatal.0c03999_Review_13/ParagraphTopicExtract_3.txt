Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is −13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at −3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant. This approach is realized by carrying out the reaction under gaseous sulfur flow on a selection of transition metal sulfides. Presumably, the gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies on the surface formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 °C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high C–H activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. In particular, the authors have observed the M–S bond energy to be a good descriptor for both C–H activation and C–C coupling reaction barriers.
