  <original_paragraph>
    Another milder oxidant that is favored to reduce formation of unwanted overoxidation is nitrous oxide (N2O). Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas. Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. (20,177−181) While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well. (179,182−185) However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2O–ODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2. (180−184,186,187) While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream. Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O.
