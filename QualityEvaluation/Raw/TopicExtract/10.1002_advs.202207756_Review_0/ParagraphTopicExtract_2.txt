Here's the analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.[1] Propylene is primarily a by-product of steam cracking (SC) and the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha.[2] In 2015, SC and FCC combined accounted for 81% of global propylene production capacity.[3, 4] The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,[5] laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene.[6] In addition to SC and FCC, several on-purpose propylene technologies have been developed to increase propylene production including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propylene. The rapid increase in shale gas production—with its substantial content of natural gas liquids[6] and thus propane[5]—has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for ≈10% of global propylene production.[7]
