  <original_paragraph>
    Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s.[103] The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide (on silica, alumina, and zeolites) was revealed in the patent literature in the 1970s,[104] which led to the development of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst used in the CYCLAR process for converting propane and butane to aromatics.[105-107] Since the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. Meanwhile, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+−H+ pair.[76, 77, 99, 100, 108, 109] Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5.[99] However, recent investigations emphasized the importance of the framework Al pair site on the Ga speciation.[76, 77, 100] We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.[54, 55, 110] The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section.
