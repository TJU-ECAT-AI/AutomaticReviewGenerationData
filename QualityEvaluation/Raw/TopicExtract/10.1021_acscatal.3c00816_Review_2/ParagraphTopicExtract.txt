    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      To synthesize the various topics and ideas, I identified the recurring themes across all inputs and combined them into a more comprehensive topic. I focused on the synthesis methods, zeolite types, and their specific application in PDH reactions, while also incorporating the importance of structural characteristics and performance factors.
