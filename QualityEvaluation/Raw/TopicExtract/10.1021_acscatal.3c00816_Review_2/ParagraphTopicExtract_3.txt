Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network. (129) The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization).
Ion exchange procedure relies on the negative charge of zeolite framework (arising from Al substitution) to stabilize exchanged metal ions, which limits the metal loadings and metal types, as well as propylene selectivity. (130) Therefore, the preparation of metal-zeolite PDH catalysts employ impregnation and direct synthesis method. The developed zeolite materials were assigned to 235 framework types based on International Zeolite Association. Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 1–2), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size. Hereafter, the advances in metal-zeolite PDH catalysts would be in turn discussed based on their topologic structure and synthesis method.
