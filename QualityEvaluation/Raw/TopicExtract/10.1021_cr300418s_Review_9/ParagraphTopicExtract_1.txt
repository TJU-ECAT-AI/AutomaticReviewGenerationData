Here's my analysis of the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    While the literature on catalysis by doped oxide is extensive, there are very few cases in which such catalysts were studied systematically, by preparing one host oxide with a variety of dopants, by a variety of methods, and by using them for the same reaction under a variety of conditions. For this reason, we thought that it would be useful to concentrate on two examples for which substantial information exists. Both examples are oxidative dehydrogenation reactions: one converts ethyl benzene to styrene, and the other converts ethane to ethylene.

  <topic_extraction>
    <step1_initial_thoughts>
      This paragraph introduces a focused study on two specific examples of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by doped oxides. It highlights the lack of systematic studies in this field and explains the rationale for selecting these particular examples.

    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The main topic revolves around the systematic study of doped oxide catalysts in two specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of this focused approach due to the scarcity of comprehensive studies in the field.

    <extracted_topic>
      Systematic study of doped oxide catalysts in two specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions: ethyl benzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address the main aspects of the topic: the systematic nature of the study, the use of doped oxide catalysts, and the specific oxidative dehydrogenation reactions mentioned. The question should encourage a detailed response that covers these key points.
