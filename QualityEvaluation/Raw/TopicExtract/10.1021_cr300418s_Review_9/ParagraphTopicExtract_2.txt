Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Wu et al. (126) have prepared Zr-doped NiO and undoped NiO by a sol–gel method. Citric acid was added slowly to an aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O. The solvent was evaporated at 70 °C until a gel was formed. This was dried at 120 °C for 24 h and then calcined in air at 450 °C for 6 h. Pure ZrO2 was not tested, but it is unlikely that it will catalyze ethane ODH at the temperature used in this work (T ≤ 400 °C). The amount of precursors was chosen so that the molar ratio 100 Zr/(Zr+Ni) was equal to 5, 10, 20, 40, and 75.

    <step2_key_concepts>
      - Sol-gel preparation method for Zr-doped NiO
      - Use of citric acid, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O as precursors
      - Specific temperature conditions for gel formation, drying, and calcination
      - Various Zr dopant concentrations (molar ratios)
      - Potential catalytic activity for ethane ODH
    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The key concepts revolve around the preparation method and composition of Zr-doped NiO catalysts. The main focus is on the synthesis process and the range of Zr dopant concentrations used for potential ethane ODH catalysis.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we need to address the key aspects of the catalyst preparation, including the method, precursors, conditions, and the range of dopant concentrations. We should also include the intended application to provide context.
