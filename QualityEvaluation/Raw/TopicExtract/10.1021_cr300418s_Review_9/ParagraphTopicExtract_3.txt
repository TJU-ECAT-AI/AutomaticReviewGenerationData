Here's my analysis based on the provided paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Nickel forms (446) one stable oxide, NiO, which has the sodium chloride structure. Ni2O3 exists, is a strong oxidant, and is much less stable than NiO. The heat of formation of NiO is small, and it should be a good oxidant as compared to most other oxides. NiO prepared at 700 °C is green and is stoichiometric; we have not found any work that uses this oxide as a catalyst. NiO prepared at 450 °C is black, has Ni vacancies, and is a p-conductor. (58, 447) The presence of a Ni vacancy creates (formally) a deficit of two electrons, which is equivalent to two holes and is believed to be responsible for the p-conductivity of the material. (58, 447) The two holes may be localized on either two oxygen atoms or on two Ni atoms. (448, 449) In a chemist's language, the presence of a Ni vacancy will create either O– or Ni3+ ions. Density functional theory has been used to examine Ni vacancies in the surface of NiO. The difficulties encountered by DFT in describing NiO correctly have been discussed by Pacchioni and Illas. (450, 451) The calculations on NiO (doped or undoped) that we report here used PBE+U with the U recommended by Rohrbach et al. (452, 453) Because of these uncertainties in the accuracy of DFT, we only emphasize here the trends suggested by the calculations.
