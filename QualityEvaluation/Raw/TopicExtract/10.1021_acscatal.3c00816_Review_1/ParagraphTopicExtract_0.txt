Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process. In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity. (75,122) MCM-41 and SBA-15 are typical mesoporous silica materials with a hexagonal structure and long 1D pores. The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2). (75,77−79) For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction.
