    <common_themes>
      - Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) as a support for PDH catalysts
      - Advantages of OMS over traditional metal oxide supports
      - MCM-41 and SBA-15 as specific examples of OMS materials
      - VOx and CrOx supported on OMS for PDH reactions
      - Performance characteristics and deactivation issues of OMS-supported catalysts
      - Role of lattice oxygen species in PDH reactions
    </common_themes>
    
    <key_concepts>
      - Low acidity, high surface area, and ordered pore structure of OMS
      - Propylene productivity of OMS-supported catalysts
      - Effect of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance
      - Structural properties influencing catalyst performance
      - Comparison between OMS and traditional metal oxide supports
    </key_concepts>
    
    <integration_process>
      The integration process involved identifying recurring themes across all inputs, such as the focus on OMS as a support material, its advantages, and specific examples like MCM-41 and SBA-15. Key concepts were extracted from each analysis, including performance characteristics, structural properties, and reaction mechanisms. These were then synthesized into a comprehensive topic that encompasses all major aspects discussed across the inputs.

  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      The final question was formulated by combining elements from all generated questions, ensuring coverage of the key aspects identified in the topic extraction. This includes the structural properties of OMS, performance comparisons with traditional supports, specific examples of OMS materials, and the underlying reaction mechanisms.
