Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues, and in particular two ethane molecules into methane and propane. The reverse reaction implies a cross-metathesis reaction with methane and its incorporation into higher alkanes, e.g. methane and propane giving two ethane molecules. This reaction is slightly endothermic independently of temperature (ca. 10 kJ/mol), but using a large excess of methane, propane was catalytically and quantitatively converted into ethane (2 ethane molecules per converted propane) using the silica supported tantalum hydrides, probably via the same elementary steps of alkane metathesis (Scheme 31a).

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To generate a comprehensive question, we should focus on the process of alkane metathesis, its reversibility, and the specific catalytic reaction mentioned. The question should encourage elaboration on the mechanism and conditions of the reaction.
