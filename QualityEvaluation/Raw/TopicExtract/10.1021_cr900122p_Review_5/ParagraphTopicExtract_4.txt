    Alkane Metathesis
In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (Cn−iH2(n−i)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides (Scheme 27a−b). (297, 298) Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors (251, 252) and kinetic studies in flow reactors (299) showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key C−C bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion (vide supra). (300-303) Several mechanistic schemes are possible, involving either two sites or one site, and they involve well-known steps of molecular organometallic chemistry.
