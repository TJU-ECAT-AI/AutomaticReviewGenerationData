    Scheme 25. Hydrogenolysis of Alkane on [Ta−H]: (a) Hydrogenolysis of Propane and Final Product Distribution. (b) Proposed Elementary Mono-hydride Active Sites vs (c) Tris-hydride Active Sites (R = CH3 for Propane)
Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers. (238) Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via C−H bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues. The low activity of the catalyst is probably due to the formation of cyclopentane, detected in all cases, which upon C−H bond activation evolved toward cyclopentadienyl surface species (vide supra, section ).
