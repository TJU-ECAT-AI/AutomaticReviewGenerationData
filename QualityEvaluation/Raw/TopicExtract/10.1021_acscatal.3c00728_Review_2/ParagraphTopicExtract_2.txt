    2.2. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in B-Based Catalysts for the ODHP Reaction
The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction. Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved. Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features.
