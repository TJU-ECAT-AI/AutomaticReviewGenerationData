4.2.1 N–H Bond Scission
Ammonia is regarded as an important hydrogen-storage medium in a hydrogen economy due to its facile decomposition to produce hydrogen. However, the leading catalyst, Ru, is expensive and scarce, preventing it from large-scale commercial utilization. Hansgen et al. (14) have used microkinetic modeling combined with DFT calculations to build a model to identify alternative bimetallic catalysts for ammonia decomposition. A volcano relationship is identified between the nitrogen-binding energy on the surface and the conversion of ammonia, in which the maximum activity is predicted to be with a nitrogen-binding energy of 134 kcal/mol, (14) as shown in Figure 14. Table 6 shows a library of nitrogen-binding energies on various bimetallic surfaces, in which the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface exhibits a nitrogen-binding energy of 130.7 kcal/mol, (14) slightly lower than the optimal value. Parallel TPD experiments of ammonia decomposition are performed to compare the activity of surface Ni–Pt–Pt(111), subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt(111). Consistent with the DFT and microkinetic prediction, the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface shows high activity for ammonia decomposition whereas the other three surfaces are inactive. (14) By comparing the desorption temperature of atomic nitrogen from the Ni–Pt–Pt(111) surface with that on Ru(0001), (341) the results show that the recombinative desorption temperature of nitrogen is lower on Ni–Pt–Pt(111), making it a potentially more active catalyst for NH3 decomposition. Hansgen et al. (253) have performed further investigations on the decomposition of ammonia on bimetallic surfaces prepared by the deposition of a monolayer of Fe, Co, or Cu on Pt(111) computationally and experimentally. The results reveal that the Fe–Pt–Pt(111) and Co–Pt–Pt(111) surfaces are active for ammonia decomposition whereas the Cu–Pt–Pt(111) surface is inactive for the reaction, consistent with the trend in nitrogen-binding energy in Table 6.

Although the dehydrogenation of NH3 has not been extended to reactor studies of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the production of H2 from NH2NH2 has been reported on supported Pt–Ni catalysts. (334) Hydrazine monohydrate (NH2–NH2·H2O) has been investigated as a potential hydrogen-storage material because it is a liquid at room temperature and has a hydrogen-storage capacity of 8.0 wt %, meeting the Department of Energy (DOE) requirements of hydrogen-storage materials. Singh and Xu have recently explored unsupported Pt–Ni nanocatalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrazine to produce H2 and N2 in a liquid-phase batch reactor at room temperature. Their results demonstrate that catalysts with Pt content between 7 and 31 mol % exhibit 100% hydrogen selectivity, whereas the corresponding Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts show no activity. (334)
4.2.2 C–H Bond Scission
The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline. Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed. Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained. (335) There is a general agreement that Pt is very active for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons; however, Pt bonds too strongly to the unsaturated carbon intermediates, leading to the formation of coke and deactivation. Therefore, the strategy to improve the dehydrogenation activity is to alloy Pt with another metal to reduce the bonding of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Such a hypothesis is verified in DFT calculations and UHV studies for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene on Pt–Au surfaces. (254) As shown in the TPD results in Figure 15a, the production of benzene is enhanced after depositing 0.5 ML Au on Pt, which shows higher benzene yield than on either Pt or Au/Pt surfaces with higher Au coverages. The corresponding AES measurements (Figure 15b) show significant carbon accumulation on unmodified Pt after the TPD experiments, confirming that the Pt bonds too strongly to cyclohexene and decomposes it to produce atomic carbon. In comparison, no carbon accumulation is detected on the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface after the same experimental procedures. The TPD and AES results are consistent with DFT predictions that the Au/Pt surfaces bind adsorbates more weakly than Pt, (254) and the results in Figure 15 indicate that modification of Pt by Au results in a more coking-resistant, and therefore more active, dehydrogenation catalyst.
Similarly, as described in the previous sections, DFT calculations predict that subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111) also binds to unsaturated hydrocarbons more weakly than unmodified Pt(111). This is consistent with experimental observations that Pt–Ni–Pt(111) is more active for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene than either of the parent metal surfaces. (15) Because the Pt-terminated surface should be preferred under the reducing environment of dehydrogenation reactions, the DFT and UHV results suggest that supported Pt–Ni catalysts should be effective dehydrogenation catalysts. This is confirmed in reactor studies that show Pt–Ni/γ-Al2O3 is more active for dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene than either monometallic catalyst. (244) The effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation is also found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation over Pt–Ni/AC. Hydrogen production on the bimetallic catalysts is enhanced by 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt % Ni catalyst and by 60 times as compared to the 0.5 wt % Pt catalyst. (336)
In addition to Pt–Au and Pt–Ni, modification of Pt by Sn also enhances the resistance to carbon accumulation. Extensive UHV studies by Koel and co-workers have revealed that the addition of Sn on the Pt(111) surface decreases the binding energies of adsorbed molecules. (235, 248, 249) The selective dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is studied using DFT calculations, (251) which show that the presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene. Other DFT and experimental studies of alkenes, such as ethylene, (248) propylene, (248) isobutylene, (248) cyclopentene, (250) and a number of C6 hydrocarbons, (249) on Sn/Pt alloys also demonstrate that the presence of surface Sn increases the dehydrogenation selectivity. Reactor studies also show that adding only a small amount of Sn to Pt catalysts improves the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate.
Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts supported on Zn–Al–O and mixed spinel Al2O3/γ-Al2O3 has been shown to increase the selectivity to propylene for propane dehydrogenation and decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst. (332) Similar results are observed for isobutane dehydrogenation over Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3. The selectivity to butenes increases from 53% for the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst up to 85–90% for the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. (335) The lower deactivation rate is due to a decrease in the binding energy of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the bimetallic particles, thereby lowering carbon deposits on the bimetallic catalyst. (283) Catalytic activity over Pt–Sn improves by pretreating the catalysts with H2 and O2 prior to reaction because of increased metal dispersion on the support. (338)
Other metals that promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt are Bi, (340) Re, (339) Pd, (342, 343)In, (333) and Fe. (286) Pt supported on spinel Al2O3 synthesized with Sn, Cu, and In are active for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes because these catalysts can withstand harsh reducing and oxidizing conditions. (333) Over Pt–Fe/SiO2, dehydrogenation activity is enhanced because Pt aids in the reduction of Fe as confirmed by FTIR. Although small amounts of Fe improve catalytic performance, large amounts of Fe lead to rapid deactivation due to the formation of an iron oxide phase. (286)
Dwindling crude oil reserves and strict air pollution regulations have made reforming of low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline an attractive economic opportunity. Liu et al. recently utilized a template synthesis procedure to formulate Pt–Re/γ-Al2O3 with high activity for naphtha dehydrogenation. (339) The synthesis method involved a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) template to control the morphology of Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the support. TEM and CO chemisorption studies showed similar particle sizes between catalysts synthesized with PAA and catalysts synthesized by traditional impregnation methods. FTIR results of CO adsorption indicated that less bridged CO was present in the catalyst synthesized with PAA, suggesting a lower surface Pt coordination number. Reaction studies performed at 766 and 769 K showed that catalysts prepared with PAA exhibited a 1.4–2.4% higher yield and a longer projected lifetime over commercial Pt–Re catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation. Although small, a 1% increase in yield represents a significant economic prospect in an industry that produces 11 million barrels of reformate from naphtha per day. (339) Another study of naphtha dehydrogenation was performed over Pt–Re/γ-Al2O3. (344) The bimetallic interactions were analyzed using EXAFS and both the Pt LIII and Re LIII edges were analyzed. If the catalysts were dried in air at temperatures ≤ 773 K prior to reduction, bimetallic bonds were formed. However, if the catalysts were dried at higher temperatures, the transport of Re was inhibited and there were fewer bimetallic interactions, leading to lower activity. (344)
The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage. Gasoline and diesel are both currently available, and using them as a hydrogen carrier instead of direct fuels could achieve some immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. (345) Bimetallic Pt–Ni and Pt–Pd catalysts supported on alumina or ceria have been shown to be active for diesel dehydrogenation. Both bimetallic catalysts not only improved the activity but also increased resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel reforming. The enhanced stability of the bimetallic catalysts is due to strong metal–metal and metal–support interactions that change the electronic properties of the metals. These changes in electronic properties improve sulfur tolerance and overall catalytic performance. (342, 343)
Pt–Rh is another active bimetallic catalyst for gasoline dehydrogenation. Pt–Rh supported on a ceramic monolith was used for E85 dehydrogenation with 100% conversion at low flow rates without deactivation. At higher flow rates, the catalyst was unstable, and adding small amounts of sulfur to the feed led to irreversible deactivation due to coking. XPS studies revealed that the catalyst had a change in oxidation state after continuous time-on-stream. (345) Pt–Rh supported on ZrO2 was superior to both monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate for gasoline dehydrogenation. The addition of a small amount Rh to the Pt catalyst increased conversion from ∼30% to ∼70%. (346)
