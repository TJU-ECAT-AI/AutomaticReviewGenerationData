<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage. Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of C–H and N–H bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures. Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3.
