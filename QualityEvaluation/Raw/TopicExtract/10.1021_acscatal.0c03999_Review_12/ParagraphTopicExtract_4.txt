    When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO. For the CO2 dissociation route, its high stability can be problematic because it prevents it from being easily activated to oxidize the surface. Therefore, finding a catalyst with a strong affinity for CO2 and its dissociation is an important criterion for ODHP with CO2. Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process. The authors therefore have concluded that CO2 is unable to reoxidize the surfaces following dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, which leads to a deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28) It is concluded that vanadia in the WOx–VOx/SiO2 cannot be fully oxidized to V2O5 with CO2 but instead oxidized to V2O4. In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277) The ability of the reduced CeO2 surface to dissociate CO2 is utilized in a series of studies with bifunctional catalysts containing a CeO2 support. (12,155,278−280) Transition metals, particularly in the form of subnanometer clusters, have also been found to be highly active for CO2 dissociation. One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane C–H activation. (281)
