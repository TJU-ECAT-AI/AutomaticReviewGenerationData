Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Regardless of the oxidant or catalyst used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the C–H bond must first be activated. In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acid–base pair. (266−268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a C–H bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270−272) In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273−275) In this context, the role of the oxidant is to regenerate the catalyst by either reoxidizing the vacancy site through providing its oxygen, or reacting with adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface.
