  <synthesized_question_generation>
    <question_integration_approach>
      To combine and refine the individual questions, I identified the common elements across all generated questions and ensured that the final question encompasses all key aspects of the synthesized topic. The question is designed to prompt a comprehensive response covering the methods, conditions, and unique properties of propane in these reactions.
