    4.4 Other Important Catalytic Reactions
In this section we will provide an overview of several types of reactions that utilize bimetallic catalysts: CO oxidation, water gas shift (WGS) reaction, and methane conversions. At present there are few UHV studies of these reactions on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The overview will therefore focus primarily on reactor studies, with the anticipation that the intriguing properties of these catalysts would inspire future UHV studies to correlate model surfaces with supported catalysts. Table 8 lists selected reactor studies for each of the three reactions.
