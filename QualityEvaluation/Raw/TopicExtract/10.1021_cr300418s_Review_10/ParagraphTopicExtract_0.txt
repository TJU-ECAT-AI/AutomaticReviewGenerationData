  <original_paragraph>
    Ethane ODH by doped NiO illustrates the difficulties encountered by both theory and experiments when studying catalysis by doped oxides. It is impossible at this time to construct realistic models of the catalytic surface, and we are limited, in both computations and experiments, to making educated guesses. However, several broad conclusions can be reached. The trends predicted by computations compare fairly well with the experimental observations. The distinction between the effect of high- and low-valence dopants, so prevalent in calculations, is observed in experiments. The computed trends in the ability of a doped oxide to break the C–H bond are in agreement with the observations and so are the trends in reducibility (whether measured by H2-TPR or oxygen thermal desorption). The strong dependence on the method of preparation is a surprise. It might appear that this provides an additional parameter in the optimization of the catalyst. However, it is not clear whether this dependence on the method of preparation is of practical importance: after several days on stream, various morphologies, generated by different methods of preparation, may evolve into the same steady-state morphology. It is therefore important, for this and other reasons, to perform long time experiments. The dependence on the method of preparation points to a shortcoming of the computations: there is practically no computational work in which surface morphology is systematically varied and its influence on the ability to break the C–H bond is studied. Such calculations are possible and should be performed.
