  <original_paragraph>
    We are interested in the oxides formed by Nb because they may allow us to guess some of the chemical properties of the Nb dopant. Niobium is a flexible atom when it combines with oxygen. It makes three stable oxides, Nb2O5, NbO2, and NbO, as well as compounds with the stoichiometry Nb3n+1O8n–2 with 5 ≤ n ≤ 8. Among these oxides, Nb2O5 has the highest energy of formation, and it is very unreactive. NbO has the lowest heat of formation (−406 kJ/mol) and is a stable oxide. It has a sodium chloride structure, just like NiO, except that 25% of the NaCl lattice sites are unoccupied; occasionally the formula Ni0.75O0.75 is used to draw attention to this fact. In binding to oxygen Nb prefers the oxidation state +5 if enough oxygen is available. However, when Nb is a substitutional dopant in another oxide, its oxidation state is likely to depend on its immediate environment. It is therefore difficult to guess a priori the oxidation state of a Nb atom that substitutes a Ni atom in the surface layer.

  <topic_extraction>
    <step1_initial_thoughts>
      This paragraph discusses the various oxide forms of niobium (Nb) and their properties, with implications for understanding Nb as a dopant in other oxides.
    </step1_initial_thoughts>
    
    <step2_key_concepts>
      - Nb forms multiple stable oxides (Nb2O5, NbO2, NbO)
      - Properties of Nb oxides (energy of formation, reactivity, structure)
      - Nb's preferred oxidation state (+5)
      - Nb as a substitutional dopant in other oxides
    </step2_key_concepts>
    
    <step3_topic_formulation>
      The main focus is on the chemical properties of Nb oxides and how they relate to Nb's behavior as a dopant, particularly in the context of its oxidation state when substituting for other atoms in oxide structures.

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To address the main topic, we need a question that explores the relationship between Nb's oxide forms and its behavior as a dopant, focusing on the uncertainty of its oxidation state in different environments.
