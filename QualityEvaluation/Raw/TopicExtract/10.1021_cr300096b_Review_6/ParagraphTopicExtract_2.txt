    3.2 Experimental Verification of Surface Segregation
DFT results predict that the surface 3d–Pt–Pt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. Parallel experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation. To verify the oxygen-induced segregation, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) has been utilized to monitor the segregation of Ni and Co in the Pt–3d–Pt(111) subsurface configurations when exposed to oxygen. (64) The onset of the characteristic ν(Ni–O) and ν(Co–O) vibrational modes confirms the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co after exposing the subsurface Pt–3d–Pt(111) configuration to oxygen at different temperatures. In addition, AES measurements were performed to quantify the segregation kinetics. The AES intensity ratios of Co/Pt or Ni/Pt were used to monitor the interchange between the subsurface and surface structures after exposure to oxygen. Figure 7a shows that the normalized AES Ni/Pt ratio increases after exposing subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111) to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The increase in the Ni/Pt AES ratio with higher oxygen exposures confirmed the oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni atoms. Using an Arrhenius equation to analyze the data, such as that shown in Figure 7b, the activation barrier for the oxygen-induced segregation of Co and Ni is estimated to be 7 ± 1 and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol, respectively. This follows the trend predicted by DFT (Figure 6), where Ni is predicted to have the smaller driving potential for segregation compared to Co and should correspondingly have a higher activation barrier.
