Here's my analysis of the given paragraph:

<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52. Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content27,53. Although Cr oxides can be incorporated into mesoporous structures to afford more active species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates and the materials thus show greater selectivity for undesired products54. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1−xO2 (ref.46). The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. Instead, when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits.
