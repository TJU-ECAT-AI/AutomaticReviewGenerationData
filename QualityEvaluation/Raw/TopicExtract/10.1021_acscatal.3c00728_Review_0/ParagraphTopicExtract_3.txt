<analysis>
  <original_paragraph>
    Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. (1−3) With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing. (4,5) Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly. (6−9)
