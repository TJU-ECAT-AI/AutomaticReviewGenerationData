  <original_paragraph>
    Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2 + C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2 + C3H8 at 823 K. The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101). The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8). The average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (~2.3-nm particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm particles, from in situ XRD) systems are small. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO. Additionally, the amount of CO produced by Fe3Ni1 exceeds that expected from C3H6 + H2O (as a result of one-step CO2-ODH and subtracting contributions from the RWGS reaction), indicating that some CO comes from the reverse Boudouard reaction and/or over-oxidation of alkenes or lighter components. Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced. Plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1 can also clarify the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP or DRP. In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-intercept of CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reforming catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 (22.2%). Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically.
