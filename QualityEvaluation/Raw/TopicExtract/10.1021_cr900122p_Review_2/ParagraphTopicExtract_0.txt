    Scheme 10. C−H Bond Activation of Alkanes on Surface Metal Oxo Species (x = 0 or 1)
Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH) on Supported VOx
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane are promising processes. (131) In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking. Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx). In fact, both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species. (133, 161-163) Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic C−H bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated. Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities. It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites. Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 °C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 °C). (161, 162, 164) This is directly related to the easier C−H bond activation of propene, the product, which is associated with a lower activation energy than the C−H bond activation of propane, the reactant.
