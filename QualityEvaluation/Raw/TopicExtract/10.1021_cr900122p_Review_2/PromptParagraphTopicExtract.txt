Scheme 10
Scheme 10. C−H Bond Activation of Alkanes on Surface Metal Oxo Species (x = 0 or 1)
Oxidative Dehydrogenation (ODH) on Supported VOx
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane are promising processes. (131) In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking. Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx). In fact, both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species. (133, 161-163) Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic C−H bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated. Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities. It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites. Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 °C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 °C). (161, 162, 164) This is directly related to the easier C−H bond activation of propene, the product, which is associated with a lower activation energy than the C−H bond activation of propane, the reactant. ODH on supported VOx also follows the typical Mars−van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. oxidation of the alkane with a concomitant reduction of metal oxo surface species followed by a reoxidation of the active sites by molecular oxygen and desorption of water. (165) Reoxidation of the catalyst is fast, and the rate determining step of the overall process is again the first C−H bond activation of the alkane. The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species (Scheme 11). (166) Similar results were obtained by periodic calculations on V2O5. (167, 168) The most favored C−H bond activation step corresponds to a H-abstraction, which yields a radical intermediate and a reduced VIV−OH species. Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species (in place of further reduction of vanadium into VIII(OH2). (166, 169) In all cases, reoxidation of VIII or VIV species is always easy with O2.

Metal-Exchanged Zeolites
Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. (23, 170-172) They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, (173) the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, (174) and the direct aromatization of methane (Scheme 12). (173, 175, 176) While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, M−alkyl species are probably key intermediates. They are formed via C−H bond activation on isolated (M−OS), dinuclear (M2O2), or more complex polynuclear sites (MxOy). These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) (177) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...). A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail.
Scheme 12
For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes. (19-24) Conversion of alkanes into aromatics takes place via successive dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps. While all these steps are not fully understood, Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a C−H bond activation and formation of a Ga−alkyl intermediate. Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 (178, 179) and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions. (20) In all cases, the active sites probably result from charge-compensation of framework aluminum by mononuclear Ga ([Ga+], (180, 181) [Ga(═O)+] (180, 182-184)) or dinuclear species [Ga2O22+] (Figure 1). (185-187) These species correspond to highly Lewis acidic centers, which can readily polarize and activate the C−H bond of alkanes as well as H2 to generate Ga−R (or Ga−H) and OH surface species (Scheme 13). Model studies show that [Ga+]-species have a relatively low activation barrier for C−H bond activation of ethane via heterolytic splitting followed by a rearrangement into [Ga(H)(Et)+] and then the concomitant elimination of H2 and ethene (Scheme 13a). (181) C−H bond activation on [Ga(O)+] generates [Ga(R)(OH)+]-species, which can readily generate ethene and [Ga(H)(OH)+]-species. However, the latter species are not prompt to eliminate H2 to regenerate [Ga(O)+], but H2O instead, leading to a reduction to Ga+ species (Scheme 13b). This shows that [Ga(O)+] is probably not the active site of choice for dehydrogenation. (188) More recent experimental and computational studies point toward dinuclear Ga species as active sites (Scheme 13c), for which all steps are favored. (186, 187) In particular, the easier desorption of H2 is noteworthy and probably results from the presence of less basic O sites in the dinuclear Ga2O22+ core with respect to this of the Ga+ or GaO+ site.

Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, (189, 190) and the coaromatization of methane and alkane. (173) Note also that Zn-zeolites probably contain similar dinuclear structures [Zn2O2] (Scheme 13c). (178, 179, 191-197) Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via C−H bond activation and formation of metal−alkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites. (179, 195, 196, 198, 199) Of several studies on the H/D exchange reaction of D2/alkane mixtures on various Zn-zeolites, (20, 200-202) a recent comparative study of H- and Zn-zeolite (zeolite = BEA) shows that Zn-BEA displays a much lower activation energy and higher rates (ca. 2 orders of magnitude) than the corresponding H-zeolite, (201) which clearly shows that the reaction mechanisms are different for the two systems, i.e. carbonium ion for H-BEA vs metal−alkyl intermediates for Zn-BEA. M-exchange zeolites and particularly those containing Mo or even Zn also catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene and H2 with a high selectivity (>90%). (170, 172, 175, 176) While the structure and the nature of the active sites are still a matter of debate, it is accepted that methane is first converted into ethylene, which is then converted into benzene through acid catalysis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the first step involving the formation of ethylene, and they involve the following: (1) carbocations, (2) radicals, or (3) organometallic intermediates, and more specifically alkylidenes, alkylidynes, or carbides. (203) Several experiments are consistent with the formation of Mo2C and imply that it could be the active species or a precursor of the active species. (204, 205) It is therefore possible that C−H bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides (vide infra, section). (206) Finally, besides C−H bond activation, it is noteworthy that stable σ-RH complexes could be observed for Cu-ZSM5 (Figure 2). (207, 208) From these studies, it is clear that metal−alkyl surface complexes are key reaction intermediates in the dehydrogenation
Under oxidizing conditions, metal-exchange zeolites, and, more specifically, those containing MoOx and WOx, catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde and related oxidation processes (see section ). (209-212) Here, it is probable that C−H bond activation takes place similarly to what has been proposed for MoOx and WOx supported on oxide materials (vide supra, section ), i.e. via H-abstraction and a radical mechanism. Moreover, Fe-zeolites are also noteworthy: they catalyze the direct and selective oxidation of benzene into phenol by N2O. (213-215) While this reaction corresponds to the selective functionalization of an aromatic C−H bond, several mechanisms are possible, such as the direct insertion of O in the C−H bond of benzene or the epoxidation followed by an acid catalyzed rearrangement of the unstable epoxide into phenol (Scheme 14). With methane, however, the reaction is stoichiometric, yielding stable MeO−Fe surface species, which can only yield methanol (in a stoichiometric way) upon extraction. (216)

Well-Defined Organometallic Complexes Supported on Oxide Materials
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The controlled reaction of molecular organometallic complexes on oxide surfaces yields well-defined organometallic complexes grafted on oxides with a variety of ligands such as hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes, and alkylidynes, which are able to react with the C−H bond of alkanes. (217) Here, we will discuss in detail stoichiometric and catalytic processes involving C−H bond activation.
Stoichiometric C−H Bond Activation and H/D Exchange Processes
Activation of Alkanes on Silica Supported Metal Hydrides
M-alkyl surface fragments are readily formed upon the C−H bond activation of alkanes on silica supported metal hydrides. For instance, the silica supported zirconium hydrides (218-222) react with a wide range of alkanes, e.g., CH4, CnH2n+2, and cycloalkanes, at low temperatures to yield the corresponding metal alkyl complexes and H2, (223) as observed with analogous molecular d0 complexes (Scheme 15a). (224) In particular, C−H bond activation of propane is faster on primary carbons and yields the most stable n-propyl surface species along with the isopropyl surface species as the minor isomer. (225) This reaction takes place via σ-bond metathesis, which formally corresponds to the transfer of a proton from the alkane to the Zr-hydride. Here, the transition state has a quasi triangular shape with an almost linear arrangement of the C atom and the two H atoms. (226-230)
