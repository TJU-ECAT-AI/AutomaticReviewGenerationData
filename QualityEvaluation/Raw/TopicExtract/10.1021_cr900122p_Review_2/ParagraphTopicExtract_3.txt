Here's my analysis based on the given paragraph:

  <original_paragraph>
    Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. (23, 170-172) They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, (173) the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, (174) and the direct aromatization of methane (Scheme 12). (173, 175, 176) While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, M−alkyl species are probably key intermediates. They are formed via C−H bond activation on isolated (M−OS), dinuclear (M2O2), or more complex polynuclear sites (MxOy). These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) (177) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...). A vast research effort has focused on Ga- and Zn-zeolites because of their industrial relevance and their unprecedented reactivity, and these systems will be discussed hereafter in more detail.
