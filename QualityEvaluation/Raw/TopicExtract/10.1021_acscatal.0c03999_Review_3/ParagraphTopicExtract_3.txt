  <original_paragraph>
    Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Coking is relatively easier to reverse by reoxidation; moreover, the presence of CO2 can help to remove coke in situ through a reverse Boudouard reaction or to inhibit the coking process. (73) Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550–650 °C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable. For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 °C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles. (67) Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation. Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2–ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2–C3 olefin selectivity. (55)

  <question_generation>
    <step1_question_formulation>
      To create a comprehensive question, we need to address both the deactivation causes and the various regeneration methods discussed in the paragraph. The question should also prompt for a comparison of the effectiveness of different regeneration approaches.
