  <original_paragraph>
    VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2–ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts. Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption–desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.
