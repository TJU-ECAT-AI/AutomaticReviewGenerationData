A new tantalum–hydride supported on zirconium hydroxide [(≡SiO)2Zr(H)–O–Ta(H)x–(OSi≡)]
(x = 1 or 3) was prepared using surface organometallic chemistry and its catalytic properties in the
propane metathesis reaction were assessed showing improved activity and selectivities in comparison
to the tantalum-hydride supported on silica.
Introduction
The need for a more efﬁcient use of raw materials, such as
petroleum, has lead to an increase in research effort in the
petrochemical industry, but to date the transformation of alkanes
at low temperatures is still a challenge.1 One process, which
allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis.
This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher
homologues. While discovered in the seventies,2 it has been shown
only recently that efﬁcient catalysts could carry out this reaction
at relatively low temperatures, e.g. 150 ◦C,3 and even catalyse the
cross-metathesis of methane and aromatics with linear alkanes.4,5
The ﬁrst well-deﬁned catalyst was based on a silica supported
tantalum(III) monohydride [(≡SiO2)Ta–H] (1),6 and more recently
it was shown that alumina supported tungsten hydrides are in fact
more efﬁcient and more selective.7 Now there are even systems
which use a mixture of homogeneous catalysts able to perform
dehydrogenation of alkane to oleﬁn followed by oleﬁn metathesis.8
In the case of single component well-deﬁned systems such as 1,
structure–reactivity relationships have shown that low coordina-
tion electron-deﬁcient metal centers are necessary, and that the
addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic
performances.9 In view of optimising the catalytic performances,
one possible approach is to change the coordination sphere of
tantalum by grafting the tantalum on a metal hydroxide obtained
through epitaxy with the hope that similar low coordination
would occur. We have previously shown that it was possible to
generate high surface area material (190 m2 g−1) having a high
concentration of surface zirconium hydroxides by reacting the
silica-supported zirconium hydride [Zr–H] with N2O (Scheme 1).10
Starting from a mixture of a mono-hydride [(≡SiO)3Zr(H)] (2a,
70%) and di-hydride surface species [(≡SiO)2Zr(H)2] (2b, 30%),
the corresponding silica-supported zirconium mono- and di-
hydroxide surface species were obtained: [(≡SiO)3Zr(OH)] (3a,
70%) and [(≡SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b, 30%); this mixture is referred to as

Experimental
General
All experiments were carried out under a controlled atmosphere,
using Schlenk and glove-box techniques. For the synthesis and
treatments of the surface species, reactions were carried out
using high-vacuum lines (1.34 × 10−3 kPa) and glove-box
techniques. [Zr–OH]10 and [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4)11 were
prepared following literature procedures. Infrared spectra were
recorded on a Nicolet Magna 550 FT-IR spectrometer equipped
with a cell designed for in situ reactions under a controlled
atmosphere. Elemental analyses were performed at the Service
Central d’Analyses du CNRS in Solaize.
Solid state NMR data acquisition and analysis
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Bruker
spectrometer (4 mm CP-MAS). Chemical shifts (d) are given in
ppm with respect to Me4Si.

EXAFS data acquisition and analysis
X-Ray adsorption spectra were recorded at the Synchrotron
Radiation Source at LURE, with the X-ray beam emitted by
the DCI storage ring (operating at 1.85 GeV with an average
current of ca. 250 mA). Samples were placed in an air-protected
cell equipped with Kapton windows. A double crystal Si(111)
monochromator was used, and the ﬂux before and after entering
the cell was measured by ionization chambers. The ﬁnal adsorption
spectra were obtained by averaging three successive acquisitions
recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode at the
tantalum LIII edge, from 9700 to 11 000 eV with a 2 eV step. EXAFS
analysis was performed using software written by Michalowicz.12
The background absorption was calculated by using a theoretical
expression developed by Lengler and Eisenberger, and the single
atomic absorption of the absorber was interpolated by a ﬁfth or
sixth-degree polynomial between ca. 11 600 and 12 400 eV
. To
remove low frequency contributions from the spectrum, each
spectrum was carefully extracted by varying both the degree and
ﬁrst point of the polynomial. The program FEFF-813 was used
to calculate theoretical values of amplitudes and phases. Fits
were optimized by considering both k1 and k3 weightings of the
EXAFS, since the latter emphasizes the higher shells, whereas
the former favours near shells of light scatterers. No signiﬁcant
differences were observed for reﬁnements carried out using the
two weightings. Selective Fourier ﬁltering of the EXAFS was used
to aid in the identiﬁcation of the backscatterers, giving rise to the
peaks occurring between 2.5 and 4 A
˚ .
Grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) on [Zr–OH] (3) by
sublimation monitored by IR spectroscopy. Synthesis of
{4/[Zr–OH]} (5)
This material was prepared by the sublimation (80 ◦C, 1.3 × 10−3
Pa) of an excess of 4 on a self-supporting disk of 3 followed
by a reverse sublimation to remove the excess of 4. During this
process, the pellet turned from white to orange. An IR spectrum
was recorded at each step. Infrared (mmax/cm−1): 3000–2800 (C–H,
vs), 2260 and 2200 (Si–H, m), 1500 and 1300 (C–H, s).
Grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) on [Zr–OH] (3) by
impregnation. Synthesis of {4/[Zr–OH]} (5)
In a Schlenk tube, [Zr–OH] (3) (480 mg) was contacted with a
solution of 4 (90 mg, 0.2 mmol) in pentane at 25 ◦C. After 2 h, the
supernatant was ﬁltered and the solid washed twice with pentane
and then dried under high vacuum (1.3 × 10−3 Pa). The gas phase
analysis after impregnation showed that 1.1 equiv. of CH3-tBu per
Ta evolved. Elemental analysis (%wt): Zr, 2.8; Ta, 3.7; C, 3.25. 1H
MAS solid state NMR: d 4.4 (s, Si–H, =C–H), 0.8 (s, CH2, CH3).
13C CP-MAS solid state NMR: d 243 (=CH), 95 (CH2), 30 (CH3).
Synthesis of the tantalum hydride supported on [Zr–OH]:
[Ta–H/Zr–OH] (6)
Whether prepared by sublimation or impregnation, 30 mg of 5
was treated with a large excess of H2 in a 350 mL glass reactor
(73 kPa), and the reaction mixture heated at 150 ◦C for 12 h.
The material turned brown. The gas phase analysis showed the
presence of methane (65%) and ethane (35%). Elemental analysis
(%wt): Zr, 2.8; Ta, 3.7. 1H solid-state MAS NMR: d 10.1 (Zr–H), 4.4
(s, Si–H, =C–H), 0.8 (s, Si–R). Infrared (mmax/cm−1): 2260–2200
m (Si–H), 1800 (Ta–H, w), 1630 (Zr–H, w).
Synthesis of the tantalum hydride supported on mixed oxide
support nSiO2–ZrO2
4SiO2–ZrO2 was prepared from the thermal decomposition of
[Zr(OSi(OtBu)3)4],14 while 2SiO2–ZrO2 and 10SiO2–ZrO2 were
prepared by a non-hydrolytic sol–gel process.15 Before use, these
materials were calcinated at 500 ◦C and subsequently treated at
500 ◦C under high vacuum for 12 h. The corresponding hydrides
were then prepared in 2 steps: grafting of 4 followed by treatment
under H2 using the same procedures as described above for the
synthesis of 5 and 6.
Metathesis of propane. Representative procedure
Propane (970 equiv. per Ta) was introduced in an infrared cell
containing a pellet of the supported tantalum hydride. Then the
cell was introduced in a furnace preheated at 150 ◦C. Small
amounts of the gas phase were collected during the reaction
(without cooling the reaction mixture) over 5 d and analyzed by
GC. TON is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of moles of propane
having reacted by the number of moles of tantalum. The selectivity
of a product (i) is deﬁned as the mol amount of this product (i)
divided by the mol amount of all products.
Results and discussions
Reaction of [Zr–OH] with 4
When [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (4) was sublimed onto a self-
supporting disk of [Zr–OH] (3), the solid turned from white to
orange. Monitoring the reaction by infrared spectroscopy shows
that most of the m(ZrO–H) bands have disappeared with the
concomitant appearance of intense m(C–H) and d(CH2) bands,
indicating that most of the hydroxyl groups have reacted with 4
to form (ZrO–Ta) bonds. Note that the (Si–H) groups coming
from the synthesis of 2a and 2b, do not react during the grafting
process (Fig. 1, spectra a and b). Elemental analysis on the
resulting solid {4/[Zr–OH]} (5) shows a 3.25%wt, 3.70%wt and
2.80%wt of C, Ta and Zr, respectively, and analysis of the gas
phase during grafting indicates the formation of 1.1 equiv. of 2,2-
dimethylpropane (CH3tBu). First, the Ta/Zr molar ratio is 0.7,
conﬁrming that most zirconium hydroxide groups have reacted
with Ta. Second, the formation of a surface complex containing
15C/Ta and the release of 1.1 CH3tBu/Ta (5.5 C) upon grafting
are in agreement with the presence of three neopentyl-like ligands
attached to the supported tantalum.
Furthermore, the
1H solid-state NMR spectrum shows the
presence of a peak at 0.8 ppm, attributed to CH2 of the neopentyl
and the CH3 protons of both the neopentyl and the neopentylidene
ligands, along with a peak at 4.4 ppm, which can be attributed
to both a carbenic proton (=C–H) and silane (Si–H) groups10
still present at the surface (Fig. 2a). The 13C solid-state CP/MAS
NMR spectrum of the corresponding 13C labeled compound a
to the metal center presents three peaks at 30, 80 (shoulder), 95

and 243 ppm (Fig. 2b). The signals at 30, 95 and 243 ppm, are
very similar to those observed for [(≡SiO)Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2]
supported on SiO2-(700),9,16 showing that the major species of
{4/[Zr–OH]} (is probably [(≡ZrO)Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (5a)
and results from the grafting of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] on
[(≡SiO)3ZrOH] (3a) (Scheme 2). Moreover, the minor species (ca.
5%), observed at 80 ppm slightly up-ﬁeld to 5a,17 can probably
arise from [(≡SiO)2Zr(OH){OTa(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2}] (5b), as
a result from the reaction of [Ta(=CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3] with
[(≡SiO)2Zr(OH)2] (3b), the corresponding bis(zirconoxy) species
5c being very unlikely because of the strain involved in its
formation.

Supported tantalum–hydride species
When 5 is heated at 150 ◦C under H2, the infrared spectrum
shows a strong diminution of the m(C–H) and d(CH2) bands of
the perhydrocarbyl ligands previously bound to tantalum. We
note the appearance of two bands of weak intensity at 1630 and
1800 cm−1 attributed to m(Zr–H)10,18 and m(Ta–H),6 respectively
(Fig. 1, spectra b, c and d). Note that the m(Si–H) bands have not
been signiﬁcantly modiﬁed in frequency and intensity indicating
that no siloxane bridge (≡Si–O–Si≡) has reacted during the
formation of the new species, in contrast to what is observed

during the preparation of the tantalum or the zirconium hydrides
supported on silica. During this process, methane (65%mol) and
ethane (35%mol) are formed (14.5 C/Ta), and this comes from
the hydrogenolysis of the neopentyl-like ligands and the cor-
responding 2,2-dimethylpropane (2.9 equiv/Ta, expected 3 for
structure 5a). The 1H solid-state NMR spectrum of the resulting
solid, [Ta–H/Zr–OH] (6), displays three peaks at 10.1, 4.4 and
0.8 ppm (Fig. S1†), which can be readily attributed to (Zr–H),
(Si–H) and (Si–R) species, respectively, by comparison with the
silica supported zirconium hydride.10 Note that the hydride bound
to Ta is not observed, as in the case of the silica supported
tantalum hydride; this resonance has only been observed as a weak
signal when tantalum hydride is prepared on MCM-41 material.19
While the formation of a tantalum hydride (Ta–H) was expected
(hydrogenolysis of the perhydrocarbyl ligands bound to tantalum
as already observed for 1), the formation of zirconium hydride (Zr–
H) indicates that Zr–O bonds were cleaved during the treatment
under H2. Note that treatment of well-deﬁned silica supported
perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2
gives hydrides along with (Si–H), which has been explained by
the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent
siloxane bridges.6,20–22 Similarly, one can propose that the putative
“tantalum tetrahydride” intermediate can react with adjacent (Zr–
O–Si≡) to form (Ta–OSi≡) and (Zr–H) bonds (Scheme 3).

Further understanding of the coordination sphere of this sur-
face species was investigated through extended X-ray absorption
ﬁne structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) at the Ta LIII edge. The data
are in agreement with a ﬁrst shell containing 2 oxygen atoms at
1.88 A
˚ , i.e. 2 O covalently bonded to Ta, along with a third oxygen
atom at 2.97 A
˚ , suggesting a weak interaction between tantalum
and a siloxane-like bridge of the surface. Concerning the second
coordination shell, the correlation between the experimental and
simulated spectra is clearly improved (see R axes between 3 A
˚ and
4 A
˚ in Fig. 3), when a zirconium and a silicon atom are in the
second coordination sphere of tantalum (Fig. 3a and Table 1),
giving a ZrOTaOSi model (6a), instead of two silicon atoms
(Fig. 3b and Table 1), having a (SiO)2Ta model. The ﬁt considering
the model 6a, with four shells around the central Ta atom, is also

In conclusion, both IR and EXAFS data are consistent with the
formation of 6a [(≡SiO)2Zr(H)–O–Ta(H)x–(OSi≡)] (x = 1 or 3)
as the major species after treatment of {4/[Zr–OH]} with H2.
Propane metathesis
The catalytic activity of the hydride 6 was compared with that of
[(≡SiO)2Ta(H)] (1) in the metathesis of propane. Under similar
conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 ◦C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were
obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment
is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower
deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of

8 h for 1. Therefore, the presence of Zr increases the overall activity
and lifetime of the tantalum hydride, while Zr–H itself is inactive
in alkane metathesis. Noteworthy: this system is more selective
towards Cn−1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity
in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for
6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively. The
hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst
compared to 1:23,24 in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis
of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h−1 and 4 h−1
respectively). The tantalum hydride 6 displays a catalytic property
closer to the one observed for the alumina supported tungsten hy-
drides than for the silica or alumina supported tantalum hydrides:
slower deactivation, higher TON, lower methane selectivity and
higher Cn+1/Cn−1 homologue selectivity.7
Fig. 4
Comparison of [(≡SiO)2Ta–H] and [Ta–H/Zr–OH] in the
metathesis of propane: (a) activity, (b) selectivity.
In order to understand the role of zirconium, we have also
investigated the preparation of tantalum hydrides on mixed
oxide supports SiO2–ZrO2 with various SiO2–ZrO2 ratios: 2SiO2–
ZrO2, 4SiO2–ZrO2 and 10SiO2–ZrO2. Note that these mixed
oxide systems do not contain ZrOH surface species, but only
silanols. Therefore, the grafting of 4 onto these materials occured
via the reaction of the silanols, and after treatment under H2,
the corresponding tantalum hydride complexes were prepared:
[Ta–H/{2SiO2–ZrO2}] (7), [Ta–H/{4SiO2–ZrO2}] (8) and [Ta–
H/{10SiO2–ZrO2}] (9) (%wt Ta: 10, 9 and 14.7 respectively). In
the case of 8, this reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy
(see Fig. S3†), and only Ta–H and Si–H bands were observed in
contrast to 6 (where Zr–H bonds were formed) which is consistent
with the formation of a [(≡SiO2)Ta–H] species.
In fact, in all cases (7–9), the TON obtained after 120 h in the
metathesis of propane are close to that obtained for 1 (60): 56, 64
and 63 for 7, 8 and 9, respectively (see Fig. S4†). Therefore, the
presence of zirconium in the support is not the sole cause for higher
activity. The requirement of a tetrahedral Zr imposed by the silica
support is likely to be a very important parameter. The support
[Zr–OH] may favor a low coordination for tantalum hydride, not
possible on other supports such as the mixed oxides.
