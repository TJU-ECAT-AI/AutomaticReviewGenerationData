Silica and alumina supported tantalum and tungsten hydrides were tested in alkane metathesis, for comparison of their catalytic
properties. In propane metathesis [W]–H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more eﬃcient than the usual [Ta]–H/SiO2 catalyst which is still
better than [Ta]–H/Al2O3 and [W]–H/SiO2. Tungsten based catalysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products selectivity and
to a higher amount of linear products than [Ta]–H/SiO2. [W]–H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst than [Ta]–H/SiO2 for butane
metathesis but is less eﬃcient with ethane. Whereas the results in the case of propane or butane can involve the higher initial activity
and a lower deactivation of the tungsten catalyst, in the case of ethane, mechanistic or kinetic aspects can be envisaged in particular
concerning the diﬃculty to dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene.

1. Introduction
The alkane metathesis, a reaction which transforms
light acyclic alkanes into a mixture of higher and lower
homologues by cleavage and formation of C–C bonds
has
been
discovered
since
about
a
decade
[1–3].
Originally,
the
silica-supported
tantalum
hydride
[(”SiO)2TaH] 1 (or [Ta]–H/SiO2) was used as a catalyst
precursor [4]. This tantalum hydride was obtained by
treatment under H2 at 150 C of the alkyl-alkylidene
tantalum
complexes
grafted
on
silica
[(”SiO)Ta
(=CH–tBu)(CH2–tBu)2]
and
[(”SiO)2Ta(=CH–tBu)
(CH2–tBu)] [5,6]. These complexes also proved to be
catalytic precursors for the alkane metathesis reaction
[7]. Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continu-
ous ﬂow reactor showed by varying the contact time,
that oleﬁns and hydrogen were primary products of this
reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the
properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9]
or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred
[11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same
carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as oleﬁn
metathesis [13]. Thus the reaction is believed to begin by
the C–H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum
hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex
[4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an oleﬁn hydride species
can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this
complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and
the oleﬁn can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17]
which by decomposition will aﬀord a new carbene and
a new oleﬁn; hydrogenation of these latter produces the
new alkanes. Then, as a subsequent development ori-
ented to the improvement of the catalytic activity, we
have investigated the use of an other metal well known
in oleﬁn metathesis [18], that is tungsten. This paper is
thus devoted to a comparison of catalytic properties
between tantalum and tungsten hydrides supported on
oxides.
2. Experimental section
2.1. General procedure
All experiments were carried out under controlled
atmosphere, using Schlenk and glove-box techniques for
the organometallic synthesis. For the synthesis and
treatments of the surface species, reactions were carried
out using high-vacuum lines (1.34 Pa) and glove-box
techniques. [W( ” CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] 2 [19] and [Ta(=
CH–tBu)(CH2–tBu)3] 3 [20] were prepared according to
the literature procedures. The preparation of 2* was
performed according to the same procedure as that used
for 2, but starting with a 90:10 mixture of non-labelled
tBuCH2Cl and (99% atom 13C) monolabelled tBuC*H2Cl
to form tBuCH2MgCl (10% 13C labelled) as alkylating
agents (yield 80–85%); the 99%
13C monolabelled
tBuC*H2Cl was prepared as previously described [21].
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna
550 FT spectrometer equipped with a cell designed for in
situ reactions under controlled atmosphere. Elemental
analyses were performed at the Service Central d’Anal-
yses of CNRS in Solaize.

under Ar in a zirconia rotor, which was then tightly
closed. In all experiments, the rotation frequency was set
to 10 kHz. Chemical shifts were given with respect to
TMS as external references for 1H and 13C NMR.
2.2. Preparation of SiO2-(700) and Al2O3-(500)
Silica Aerosil from Degussa with a speciﬁc area of
200 m2/g
was
dehydroxylated
under
high
vacuum
(10)5 mmHg) at 500 C for 12 h then at 700 C for
4 h. After this treatment, the speciﬁc area was about
180 m2/g with an OH density of 0.7 OH/nm2. The
alumina from Johnson Matthey with a speciﬁc area of
200 m2/g was ﬁrst calcined at 500 C under a N2/O2
ﬂow overnight then partially dehydroxylated at 500 C
under high vacuum (10)5 Torr) for 12 h. After this
treatment, the speciﬁc surface area was about 162 m2/g
with an OH density of 1.4 OH/nm2 (0.37 mmol OH/g).
2.3. Preparation of the various supported tantalum
and tungsten complexes in an IR cell
The silica or alumina supports were pressed into a
17 mm diameter disk (# 50–70 mg) which was ﬁxed in a
pyrex or quartz carrier, then introduced in the IR cell
(300 ml). After the thermal treatment under vacuum at
700 or 500 C respectively, the desired complex 2 or 3
was sublimed on the disk and the unreacted excess
desorbed back at 50–70 C leaving the tantalum or
tungsten hydrocarbyl complexes grafted on silica or
alumina.
All these surface complexes were subsequently treated
under H2 (650 Torr) at 150 C overnight in order to
prepare
the
corresponding
tantalum
or
tungsten
hydrides supported on silica or alumina 1, 9, 7, 8.
2.4. Preparation of the various supported tantalum and
tungsten hydrocarbyl complexes by impregnation
in pentane
A mixture of 2 or 3 (115 mg, 0.246 mmol) and SiO2-
(700) or Al2O3-(500) (0.8 g) in pentane (10 mL) was
stirred at 25 C for 4 h. After ﬁltration, the solid was
washed three times with pentane and all volatile com-
pounds were condensed into another reactor (volume
known > 6 L) in order to quantify neopentane evolved
during the impregnation. The resulting yellow-brown
solids were dried under vacuum (10)5 Torr).
2.5. Treatment under H2 of the solids; quantiﬁcation
of neopentyl-like ligands and formation of surface
hydrides
The solids previously obtained were heated at 150 C
in the presence of a large excess of anhydrous H2
(77 330 Pa). After 15 h, the gaseous product was
quantiﬁed by GC.
2.6. Alkane metathesis
In a glove box, the solid catalyst was introduced in a
batch reactor (300 ml). After evacuation of argon, the
dry
gaseous
alkane
was
added
(600 Torr;
sub/
cat = 600), and the reaction mixture was heated at
150 C. To monitor the reaction, aliquots were expan-
ded into a small volume, brought to atmospheric pres-
sure and analysed by GC (KCl/Al2O3 50 m, 0.32 mm
capillary column with FID detector for alkanes).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Grafting of tantalum and tungsten complexes
on silica and alumina; formation of the corresponding
hydrides
In order to prepare various oxide-supported tungsten
and tantalum hydrides aﬀording comparison in catalytic
properties, tungsten neopentyl-neopentylidyne [W( ”
C–tBu)(CH2–tBu)3] 2 [19] was grafted on silica-(700)
[22] and c-alumina-(500) [23] previously treated under
vacuum at 700 and 500 C, respectively. Similarly, tan-
talum neopentyl-neopentylidene [Ta(=CH–tBu)(CH2–
tBu)3] 3 [20] was supported on c-alumina-(500). All the
grafting reactions involve the consumption of surface
OH groups of the oxide supports; in the case of silica,
the free OH groups giving a thin IR m(OH) band at
3747 cm)1 and representing most of the hydroxyls, were
fully consumed; in the case of alumina, mainly the OH
groups [24–27] corresponding to higher wavenumbers
(m(OH) = 3650–3800 cm)1) reacted with the tungsten
or tantalum complexes; in counterpart, neopentane was
evolved in the gas phase. Thus, the grafting reactions of
2 on silica-(700) and c-alumina-(500) led to the forma-
tion
of
the
monografted
alkyl-alkylidyne
tungsten
complexes [(ZO)W( ” C–tBu)(CH2–tBu)2] (Z = Si, 4,
Al, 5) [22,23]. The characterization of these surface
complexes has been reported elsewhere [22,23], showing
in particular, the sole presence of the carbyne tautomeric
form instead of the bis(carbene) one. Grafting of the
tantalum complex [Ta(=CH–tBu)(CH2–tBu)3] 3 on c-
alumina-(500) led to the consumption of the same range
of m(OH) bands as with tungsten and the appearance of
m(CH) and d(CH) bands (ﬁgure 1b) with formation of a
brown solid 6; 1.5 equiv. of neopentane per Ta was also
evolved in the gas phase. Further characterization of
solid 6 by elemental analysis (4.9 wt% Ta; 12.6 C per Ta),

reaction with excess H2O, releasing 2.4–2.6 neopentane/
Ta or treatment under hydrogen at 150 C (liberating
12.0–12.5 CH4/Ta) indicated the presence of 2.4–2.5
neopentyl-like remaining ligands on tantalum; then,
solid 6 reasonably appears as a roughly 1/1 mixture of
mono-
and
bibonded
species
[(AlO)Ta(=CH–
tBu)(CH2–tBu)2]
and
[(AlO)2Ta(=CH–tBu)(CH2–
tBu)]. The 1H solid state MAS NMR spectrum of solid 6
showed only a large signal at 1 ppm consistent with the
methyl and methylene groups of the ligands; the 13C
solid state CP MAS NMR spectrum of the 13C a-enri-
ched
(10%)
surface
complexes
[(AlO)xTa(=C*H–
tBu)(C*H2–tBu)3)x] in solid 6 presented an intense peak
at 33 ppm (–CH3), as well as two other broad signals at
102 ppm (–C*H2–) and 246 ppm (=C*H–) consistent
with the proposed formula (ﬁgure 2).
All these complexes were further treated under H2 at
150 C overnight, in order to prepare surface tantalum
and tungsten hydrides. Figure 3 shows the features of
m(TaH) and m(WH) bands of the tantalum and tungsten
hydrides supported on silica or alumina. As already
reported
[23],
the
treatment
of
[( ” SiO)W( ” C–
tBu)(CH2–tBu)2] 4 under H2 led to the partial sintering
of the metal as evidenced by TEM and the partial
reappearence of the m(OH) band at 3747 cm)1; however,
two bands appeared at 1815 and 1960 cm)1 with a series
of shoulders which can all be assigned to the m(WH)
bands of a silica-supported tungsten hydride [W]–H/
SiO2 7 (ﬁgure 3c).
In the case of alumina, the thermal treatment under
H2 of complex [(AlO)W( ” C–tBu)(CH2–tBu)2] 5 led to
a partial consumption of remaining OH, the total con-
sumption of m(CH) and d(CH) bands and the appear-
ance of two bands at 1804 and 1903 cm)1 (ﬁgure 3d),
which can be assigned to the m(WH) vibration modes of
a [W]–H/Al2O3 8. Eﬀectively, these latter can exchange
reversibly with D2 during which a residual band remains
unexchanged at 1930 cm)1 corresponding to a m(AlH)
band. Similarly to what is known on silica [4,28–31], this
band can arise from the opening of an aluminoxane
bridge Al–O–Al and the transfer of an hydride from
tungsten to an aluminium atom. This observation as
well as the partial consumption of the m(OH) band
suggests that tungsten hydride should be linked to the
support by two oxygen atoms and could be considered
as a bishydride (scheme 1).
The treatment under hydrogen of the tantalum
complex [Ta(=CH–tBu)(CH2–tBu)3] grafted on c-alu-
mina-(500) (solid 6) led to the almost complete con-
sumption of the m(CH) and d(CH) bands, a partial
consumption of the m(OH) bands and the appearance of
two bands at 1830 cm)1 and 1930 cm)1 corresponding,
respectively, to m(TaH) and m(AlH) vibration modes
(ﬁgures 1d and 3a). Again the formation of this latter

band already evidenced with tungsten, should involve
the opening of an Al–O–Al bridge and the transfer of an
hydride to an aluminium atom. Similarly, the resulting
tantalum hydride [Ta]–H/Al2O3 9 is believed to be
linked to the surface by two oxygen atoms.
3.2. Comparison of the catalytic properties of the various
hydrides in the metathesis of propane
The various tantalum and tungsten hydrides sup-
ported on silica or alumina were tested at 150 C, under
batch
conditions,
in
the
metathesis
of
propane
(600 Torr; C3H8/M: R = 600); the ﬁgure 4 shows the
evolution of T.O.N. during time for the various hydride
catalysts, which all undergo a certain extent of deacti-
vation process; however, metal catalysts supported on
alumina appear to deactivate less rapidly than on silica
as indicated by the fact that curves (b) and (d) have
reached a plateau while (a) and (c) still show a slight
activity.
[W]–H/Al2O3 8 proves to be twice more eﬃcient than
the usual [Ta]–H/SiO2 catalyst 1 with corresponding
T.O.N. of 120 and 55 molpropane molw
)1, respectively,
after 120 h of reaction. [Ta]–H/Al2O3 9 and [W]–H/SiO2
7 catalysts prove to be still less active than [Ta]–H/SiO2.
The initial activities (molpropane molw
)1 h)1) of the various
catalysts conﬁrm their reactivity order: [W]–H/Al2O3
(8–9) > [Ta]–H/SiO2 (3–4) > [Ta]–H/Al2O3 (2–3) > [W]
–H/SiO2 (1–2).
Concerning the selectivities of the reaction obtained
with the various hydrides (ﬁgure 5), it turns out that
tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of
products than the tantalum ones; in particular, a smaller
amount of methane and pentanes is formed. Both these
products come from the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyc-
lobutane, which should be less favoured with tungsten
than tantalum (scheme 2). Indeed, the selectivity of
products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2]
and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in
the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in oleﬁn
metathesis [11].
Interestingly, if we consider the n/iso ratio, either for
butanes or pentanes, it also appears that tungsten cat-
alysts give slightly higher amounts of linear products
than tantalum ones (ﬁgure 6). In all cases, the selectivity
in linear compounds is greater for butanes than pen-
tanes. In the case of tungsten catalysts, the selectivity in
favour of linear products (or the n/iso ratio) also
increases with the reaction time. The ratio of linear to
branched products is due to the relative amount of
linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the
initial C–H bond activation step [11,12]. The increase of
linear products, as the reaction proceeds, is probably the
result of a change over time of the coordination sphere
of the active site. It is possible that starting from a
tungsten hydride precursor, the hydrocarbyl ligands can
progressively accumulate, inducing steric eﬀects which
could favour the linear alkyl intermediate.
3.3. Comparison of the catalytic properties of [W]–H/
Al2O3 and [Ta]–H/SiO2 in the metathesis of other
alkanes
In order to further compare the two catalyst precur-
sors, the metathesis of ethane and butane was also

investigated. The ﬁgure 7 shows the various T.O.N.
obtained after 120 h for all the cases. Noteworthy, while
[W]–H/Al2O3 proves also more active than [Ta]–H/SiO2
for the metathesis of butane, it is much less eﬃcient for
ethane.
The better performance in the case of propane and
butane is due to a better initial activity and a lower
deactivation of [W]–H/Al2O3 compared to [Ta]–H/SiO2.
As in the case of tantalum, oleﬁns are also probably
primary products in the metathesis of alkanes catalysed
by [W]–H/Al2O3. Tungsten, which is a standard oleﬁn
metathesis catalyst [18], not surprisingly shows better
performances than tantalum.
The low activity of [W]–H/Al2O3 in the case of ethane
compared to [Ta]–H/SiO2 is probably related to the
diﬀerent intrinsic properties of these two metals; in
particular, the formation of ethylene could be more
diﬃcult with tungsten.
The comparison of selectivity with each alkane shows
again (ﬁgure 8) that [W]–H/Al2O3 gives a product dis-
tribution slightly narrower than [Ta]–H/SiO2. Again the
1,2-disubstituted
metallacyclobutane
intermediates
leading to higher products should be disfavoured.
4. Conclusion
Silica and alumina supported tantalum and tungsten
hydrides were tested in alkane metathesis, for compari-
son of their catalytic properties. In propane metathesis
[W]–H/Al2O3 proves to be twice more eﬃcient than the
usual [Ta]–H/SiO2 catalyst which is still better than
[Ta]–H/Al2O3 and [W]–H/SiO2. Tungsten based cata-
lysts lead to a narrower distribution in the products
selectivity and to a higher amount of linear products
than [Ta]–H/SiO2. [W]–H/Al2O3 is also a better catalyst
than [Ta]–H/SiO2 for butane metathesis but is less
eﬃcient with ethane. Whereas the results in the case of
propane or butane can involve the higher initial activity
and a lower deactivation of the tungsten catalyst, in the
case of ethane, mechanistic or kinetic aspects can be
envisaged in particular concerning the diﬃculty to
dehydrogenate ethane into ethylene.
