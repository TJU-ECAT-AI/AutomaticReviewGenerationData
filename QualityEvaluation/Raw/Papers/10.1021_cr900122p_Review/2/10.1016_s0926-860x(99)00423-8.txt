Abstract
A new methane partial oxidation (MPO) catalyst has been prepared by grafting MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand)
onto the surface of dried HZSM-5 zeolite. This reaction was performed in an organic solvent under an inert atmosphere with
the exclusion of water from the reaction. It was shown by FT-IR spectroscopy that the reaction takes place between the acidic
hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the acetylacetonate ligands of the complex. After the grafting reaction, the solid was
washed, dried and calcined in air, to afford the ﬁnal [S]O2MoO2, Mo(VI), highly dispersed, surface species. The catalytic
activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation
catalysts. ©2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The conversion of methane into organic com-
pounds of greater interest is of signiﬁcant scientiﬁc
and industrial relevance. This is due to the large nat-
ural gas reserves, of which methane is the principal
component.
Transformation
of
methane
into
methanol
or
formaldehyde is a very attractive process since the
former compound can be converted into liquid fuels
similar to gasoline, and the latter is a key compo-
nent in a number of synthetic organic methods. A

widely studied transformation is the partial oxida-
tion of methane (MPO) to HCHO and CH3OH with
molybdenum oxide-based catalysts. In the ﬁrst reports
regarding these reactions [1,2], MoO3 was supported
on silica and N2O was used as an oxidant. The expen-
sive reagent nitrous oxide was replaced by oxygen in
later work [3–5]. In these studies, the conversion of
methane and the selectivity to give HCHO was found
to be highly dependent on both the degree and the
uniformity of dispersion of molybdenum on the silica.
Recently [6–9], catalysts based on MoO3 supported
on zeolites, principally HZSM-5, were found to be
active in the dehydrogenation and aromatization of
methane. Both the oxomolybdenum species, which is
supported in the pore system, and the acidic sites of

the zeolite were implied in the reaction mechanism.
The weakness of the C–H bond of methane, caused
by distortion of the methane molecule through its in-
teraction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed
as the ﬁrst step in the methane activation mechanism
[10].
The authors have reported the partial oxidation of
methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impreg-
nation [13,14]. It was shown that three different types
of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts,
the relative amount of each one varying with the
metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octa-
hedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites.
Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dis-
persion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase.
Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive
surface structures is an expeditious alternative method
to obtain catalytic systems with deﬁnable structure and
composition [11]. From an industrial viewpoint, this
method offers potential for the design of efﬁcient cat-
alysts with an advantageous combination of speciﬁc
properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous
systems [12].
We report here the preparation of a new catalyst
for the partial oxidation of methane by grafting of
MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the
surface of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite.
2. Experimental
2.1. General procedures
All operations were performed under an inert at-
mosphere using standard vacuum line (Schlenk) tech-
niques. Dichloromethane was puriﬁed by distillation
from P2O5 under an inert atmosphere prior to use.
The precursor MoO2(acac)2 complex and the acidic
HZSM-5 zeolite were prepared as described in the lit-
erature [13,15,16].
2.2. Catalyst preparation
HZSM-5
zeolite
(ca.
330 m2 g−1),
with
an
SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90, was used as the support for
all the samples studied. The support was activated by
drying at 523 K, under vacuum (0.01 Torr), for 5 h.
Samples were prepared by impregnating the dried ze-
olite with a solution of MoO2(acac)2 in CH2Cl2. The
suspension was stirred for 24 h at room temperature,
the solid was ﬁltered off and washed four times with
200 ml of CH2Cl2 (4 ml × 50 ml). The solid was dried
in vacuum at room temperature for 2 h, and calcined
in air at 673 K for 10 h. Colorless or pale brown solids
were obtained by this method.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Elemental analysis was carried out in the Galbraight
Laboratories, Knoxville, USA. The infrared spectra
were recorded from self-supported thin wafers placed
in a specially designed infrared cell assembled with
greaseless stopcocks and CaF2 windows. The sam-
ples were degassed under vacuum at 523 K for 5 h,
and then cooled down to room temperature before
spectra were recorded, to avoid the presence of water.
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded us-
ing a Philips PW1710 diffractometer with Cu Ka ra-
diation. H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR)
measurements were performed using a Micromerit-
ics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples (usually 0.035 g)
were pretreated from ambient temperature to 823 K
under a ﬂow of argon. Following pretreatment, the
samples were cooled to room temperature and the gas
ﬂow changed to a mixture of 17% H2 in argon. The
gas ﬂow rate used was 50 cm3 min−1 (measured un-
der normal conditions) and the temperature was in-
creased at a rate of 10 K min−1 from ambient temper-
ature to 1200 K. During this time, the exit gas was
monitored using a TCD detector. The unique area
under the curve was integrated to evaluate the hy-
drogen consumption. UV diffuse reﬂectance spectra
(UV DRS) were obtained using Spectralon as a ref-
erence on a Perkin–Elmer Lambda-20 spectrometer
equipped with a diffuse reﬂectance accessory. The
spectra were recorded immediately after calcination
of the samples. The scanning wavelength range was
198–500 nm and the scan speed was 120 nm min−1.
Photoelectron spectra were acquired using a Fisons Es-
calab MkH 200R spectrometer equipped with a hemi-
spherical electron analyzer and Mg Ka X-ray excit-
ing source (1253.6 eV). The samples were mounted on
a sample rod, placed in a pretreatment chamber and

141
degassed under vacuum (10−6 Torr) prior to transfer
into the analysis chamber. The C 1s, O 1s, Si 2p, Mo 3d
and Al 2p peaks were recorded. The intensities were
estimated by calculating the integral of each peak af-
ter subtraction of the ‘S’-shaped background and ﬁt-
ting the experimental curve to a mixture of Lorentzian
and Gaussian lines of variable proportion. The bind-
ing energies were calculated using the Si 2p peak at
103.4 eV and the C 1s peak at 284.9 eV.
2.4. Catalytic runs
The partial oxidation experiment was performed
at atmospheric pressure using a reaction system de-
scribed in a previous paper [13]. The apparatus essen-
tially consisted of a quartz tubular ﬂow reactor (the
dimensions of the reaction zone were i.d. = 21.4 mm,
length = 60 mm), a gas feed system for each reac-
tant (methane and oxygen) with individual control
by means of mass ﬂow meters and an exit gas
ﬂow meter. All the products were analyzed using a
Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas chromatograph equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector and two columns:
a Porapak Q column to separate CH4, CO2, CO + O2,
HCOH and water, and a column packed with 5A
molecular sieves to separate CO and O2. Calibration
for formaldehyde was performed using a 40% aque-
ous HCOH solution. Catalyst samples were pretreated
in situ in a ﬂow of oxygen from ambient temperature
to the reaction temperature, i.e. 923 K, and held at
the latter temperature for approximately 1 h. Space
velocity of the feed (W/F, weight of catalyst/molar
ﬂow rate) was 7.41 g h mol−1 and the CH4 : O2 molar
ratio was 5.3 : 1. It was shown that approximately
2 h were required to attain steady conditions. Sam-
pling of the product stream was repeated until the
analytical results were reproducible. In the present
research, the carbon balance was always better than
97%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The supported molybdenum oxide catalysts de-
scribed previously were usually prepared using an im-
pregnation method, where the support was placed in
contact with a solution of molybdenum salt in water.
After this treatment, the solid was dried and calcined.
Depending on the exact work-up procedure used,
different distributions of molybdenum oxides were
found: isolated tetrahedral MoO42−species, grafted
to the support, MoO3 crystallites and polyoxomolyb-
dates, both physisorbed onto the surface [4–7,14,17].
A more effective route for the preparation of highly
dispersed molybdenum oxo species on the surface has
resulted from the grafting method. This method con-
sists of the formation of chemical bonds between the
metal and the support, usually by reaction of one
or more ligands in a metal complex with reactive
surface sites, such as acidic silanols [18–20]. This
method was used in the study described here. HZSM-5
(dried at 250◦C under vacuum, 0.01 Torr (see Sec-
tion 2), prior to reaction) was used as the support and
was stirred, at room temperature, in the presence of
a dichloromethane solution of MoO2(acac)2. During
this grafting step, the solid became brown in color and
the solution turned green. The green color in solution
was attributed to the formation of soluble complexes,
analogous to molybdenum blues [21,22], by hydroly-
sis of MoO2(acac)2. Molybdenum blues is a generic
term that describes several oxo–hydroxo complexes
of molybdenum, where the Mo oxidation state varies
between V and VI, such as in MoO2(OH) and the
non-stoichiometric MoO2.5(OH)0.5. The yellow color
of a MoO2(acac)2 solution did not change when this
solution was stirred for several hours in the absence of
zeolite. These results indicate the participation of the
zeolite in this hydrolysis process, perhaps due to the
presence of traces of water occluded into the channel
system.
After washing the samples with CH2Cl2 and dry-
ing at 673 K in air, the solids became colorless or
pale brown. Different samples with different amounts
of molybdenum were prepared, and in each case, the
metal content was determined by means of ICP-AE
spectroscopy. It is noteworthy that a maximum molyb-
denum content of ca. 2% was achieved, even on using
a large excess of the precursor complex. The samples
are identiﬁed throughout the text as Mo along with a
number, in parenthesis, indicating the percentage of
molybdenum detected.
The role of the acidic hydroxyl surface groups in
the ‘grafting’ reaction (Eq. (1)) was conﬁrmed by

FT-IR spectroscopy, recorded under vacuum to avoid
the presence of water on samples, and was manifested
by a decrease in intensity of the vibration bands near
3614 cm−1, which were assigned principally to the
O–H stretching of bridged Si(OH)Al groups (Brønsted
acid sites) [23,24] (Fig. 1).

The decrease in the intensity of these bands is
more marked when the percentage loading of molyb-
denum grafted onto the surface increases. Indeed,
for Mo(2.01), these bands practically disappear. If
we consider that this zeolite shows 0.4 meq OH
groups g−1, on the basis of an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of
90, a maximum load of 1.9% of molybdenum can be
achieved, with a ratio of two OH groups per Mo atom.
In addition, acetylacetone was detected in the so-
lution by 1H-NMR spectroscopy after the reaction
(clearly, some of this ketone could also be obtained
from the hydrolysis of the original complex, as men-
tioned above).

scan of the Mo3d region.
The UV diffuse reﬂectance spectra of the samples
(Fig. 2) exhibit absorption bands near 240 nm due
to ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions [25],
O2−→Si4+ and O2−→Mo6+, in accordance with
the presence of the proposed MoO42−molybde-
num(VI) species on the surface.
These tetrahedral dioxomolybdenum species, which
are bonded to the support through two oxygen ligands,
correspond to the usual model for isolated Mo6+ in
Mo/SiO2 and Mo/Al2O3 catalysts [26–28]. In the dif-
fuse reﬂectance FT-IR spectra of these systems, a very
weak and broad band is observed near 940 cm−1, and
this can be assigned to the Mo=O stretching vibra-
tion. Different data for the Mo=O stretching frequency
bands obtained by IR or Raman techniques have been
reported [27,29,30].
In accordance with the proposed oxidation state,
XPS analysis of the Mo(2.01) sample (Fig. 3) indi-
cates [31] the presence of highly dispersed molybde-
num(VI) species (Mo 3d binding energy = 232.3 eV).
The XRD spectra of the catalysts were regis-
tered and compared to those of the pure support,
MoO2(acac)2 and MoO3. The spectra of the grafted
catalysts were practically identical to that of the pure
zeolite sample. Neither the characteristic peaks of
the starting complex nor those of MoO3 were found
in these spectra. This fact indicates that the reaction
between the complex and the surface OH groups al-
lows us to obtain highly dispersed oxo species, and
this behavior was different from that found when an
aqueous impregnation method was used. In the case
of aqueous impregnation, aggregates of MoO3 are
usually detected, as mentioned previously. In the ex-
ample under discussion here, if some crystallites of
MoO3 did exist, they would have to be smaller than
50 Å (the detection limit of the XRD analysis).
TPR studies were also carried out and the pattern for
the Mo(2.01) sample was compared in Fig. 4 with that
of a sample of a ‘classical’ impregnated Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst, with a similar Mo content (2%) [14], and that
of a sample of pure MoO3. It can be observed that the
considerable dispersion of the metal obtained using
our method gives rise to a signiﬁcant decrease in the
reducibility in comparison with MoO3.
3.2. Catalytic test
The unique products obtained in the partial ox-
idation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst (corresponding to Mo(1.36)) were formalde-
hyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and H2O. After
reaction, new Mo elemental analysis was carried out
and the same value (1.36%) was obtained, in accor-
dance with a strong interaction between the surface
oxo-species and the support. In Table 1, the results
of the methane conversion are summarized; product
selectivities are given along with space time yields of
formaldehyde (STYHCOH) obtained with this catalyst
and those reported by the authors using ‘classical’
impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts under the
same reaction conditions [13,14]. It can be seen that
the formaldehyde selectivity was greatly enhanced
with the grafted catalyst while the values for methane
conversion remained similar. Consequently, formalde-
hyde space time yield increases signiﬁcantly from
13–19 to 61.1 g of HCOH per kg of catalyst and hour.
Although this value is still too low for a possible in-
dustrial application of the process, it is similar to the
best results reported in the literature for MoO3/SiO2
catalysts [33–37].
Likewise, catalytic results for HZSM-5 are given
in Table 1. It shows a high conversion value lead-
ing to the total oxidation products, mainly CO.

[14]), and pure MoO3 (c).
In a previous paper [13], it has been shown that
the acid sites of the zeolite are the active cen-
ters for methane activation. Therefore, it seems
clear that the active sites of the partial oxidation to
formaldehyde belong to the supported molybdenum
phase.
In accordance with the results of Lucas et al.
[13,14], the supported metal oxide phase of the im-
pregnated HZSM-5 catalysts is constituted by three
kinds of species: (i) tetrahedral monomeric species
with two M=O (M=Mo, W) terminal bonds, which
is the main species at low loading, (ii) octahedral
polymeric species similar to polyoxotungstates or

polyoxomolybdates, which are the main species at
medium and high loading (7.1%); and (iii) MO3 crys-
tallites (M=Mo, W) with terminal M=O sites. The
behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can
be explained as a function of both density and activity
of these types of species and the residual acid sites
of the HZSM-5 zeolite. Several authors have reported
the speciﬁcity of M=O and M–O–M sites (M: Mo,
V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides,
respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5
silica-supported catalysts [32,33,36–38]. Thus, the
1.3%Mo/HZSM-5 and the 7.1%W/HZSM-5 ‘classi-
cal’ impregnated catalysts (the samples that exhibited
A. Antiñolo et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 193 (2000) 139–146
145
the best HCOH yields of those tested in [13,14] that
possess mainly polymeric species lead to a relatively
high production of carbon oxides from both methane
and formaldehyde. As a consequence, formaldehyde
selectivity values are low. This parameter is im-
proved signiﬁcantly with the use of the new grafted
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (with carbon oxides still being
the majority products). As noted above, this catalyst
possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two
terminal Mo=O bonds. Therefore, this result strongly
supports the hypothesis regarding the speciﬁcity of
Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane. The
relatively high values of CO selectivity for the two
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts discussed above, i.e. the im-
pregnated catalyst described previously [14] and the
grafted catalyst reported here, can be attributed to the
presence of residual acid sites on the zeolite surface.
The high degree of surface covering in the W/HZSM-5
catalyst (due to the high metal loading) leads to a
lower CO selectivity, although further oxidation of
formaldehyde must be taken into account [38].
4. Conclusions
A new catalyst for the MPO reaction has been ob-
tained by grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto the surface of
the HZSM-5 zeolite. This reaction takes place between
the reactive acid hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and
the basic acetylacetonate ligands. As a consequence of
this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water,
isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state
VI were obtained with a large dispersion. This behav-
ior is signiﬁcantly different from that observed when
impregnation methods in water were used to prepare
similar catalysts.
On account of the speciﬁc activity of these iso-
lated MoO42−species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield
in the methane partial oxidation reaction with re-
spect to those of the ‘classical’ impregnated W and
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts.
