ABSTRACT 
The conversion 
of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics, 
chiefly benzene, 
toluene and xylenes 
(BTX), 
can be accomplished 
using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type. The conversion 
to aromatics 
is 
not completely 
selective. 
Light alkenes, the probable 
reaction 
intermediates, 
together 
with light 
alkanes, are formed in addition 
to the BTX components. 
On H-ZSM-5, 
all the hydrogen 
atoms 
lost on aromatization 
of the reactant 
alkane seem to appear in the products 
as light alkanes. It 
has been found that, when propane 
is used as the reactant 
at 5OO’C and 0.1 MPa, the BTX 
selectivity 
can be increased 
from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) 
to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment 
of the base 
zeolite with solutions 
of zinc or gallium nitrate, 
such that the final zinc or gallium content 
is ca. 
1.0 mass-%. 
A comparative 
study of the conversion 
of propane, 
n-butane 
and i-butane 
over Zn- 
ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity 
and BTX selectivity. 
i-Butane 
is the 
most reactive 
of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage 
hydrogen 
recovery as 
dihydrogen. 
However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity. 
INTRODUCTION 
There is a widespread and growing interest in the conversion of light alkanes 
to more useful products. The catalytic conversion of methane in particular to 
methanol [ 1, 21 or higher hydrocarbons [ 3-51 has received much attention. 
In general, the need for a suitable co-reactant to be used with methane in 
order to overcome thermodynamic limitations [ 41 has been recognized. In con- 
trast, the conversion of higher alkanes, such as C&/C, cuts, can proceed in the 
absence of such co-reactants. 
Thus the conversion of methane to acetylene and acetylene-ethylene 
mix- 
tures can be achieved in the absence of co-reactants only at temperatures above 
ca. 1600” C. Much lower temperatures are required for the conversion of higher 
alkanes such as ethane to higher hydrocarbons. Further, as Table 1 shows, 
thermodynamic data [6] reveal that, in general, alkane-to-aromatics conver-

sions become more favourable as the size of the alkane is increased, and that 
aromatics are thermodynamically 
favoured over the corresponding alkene. 
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is at the heart of 
processes such as Oleflex [ 71, Aromatization processes such as Cyclar [ 
8, 91 
and MB-forming [lo] have also recently been announced. These processes of- 
fer a means of converting light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, 
and are 
based on the use of catalysts such as ZSM-5 and related materials. 
The conversion of light alkanes such as propane and butane to aromatics is 
not completely selective. Light alkenes, the probable reaction intermediates, 
are formed in addition to the BTX 
components. Further, it seems that on 
H-ZSM-5 all of the hydrogen atoms lost on aromatization 
of the reactant al- 
kane appear in the product as light alkanes 
[ 111. This effective transfer of 
hydrogen atoms places a severe restriction on the BTX selectivity that can be 
attained (Fig. 1). For example, with propane, if the sole alkane side-product is 
methane, the maximum BTX selectivity (% carbon basis) is ca. 44 to 49%, but 
if the sole alkane side-product is ethane, then it falls to ca. 16 to 19%. 
91 
On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is re- 
leased as dihydrogen [ 111 and an improved BTX selectivity results. It appears 
[ 121 that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, 
but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs 
at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone. The con- 
tact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution 
obtained in these systems [ 10,131. To summarize, the observed selectivity to 
aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time. The 
object of the work described here was to examine these effects more system- 
atically and, in addition, to compare the aromatization behaviour of the three 
light alkanes: propane, n-butane and i-butane. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
ZSM-5 zeolites (silicon: aluminium ratio = 19) were prepared as described 
previously [ 141, and were characterized using X-ray diffractometry. The syn- 
thesized materials were converted into the NH,+ form by exchange with am- 
monium chloride solutions. The H+ form was obtained by calcining at 550°C. 
Zinc or gallium was introduced by treating the H-ZSM-5 with aqueous solu- 
tions of the respective metal nitrate. The final zinc or gallium contents of the 
catalysts were typically up to ca. 1.0 mass-%. All solids were crushed and sized 
before use. 
Reactions were carried out using a flow microreactor which contained ca. 
0.4 g catalyst. The reactant was passed at a suitable space velocity (mass hourly 
space velocity, MHSV, in the range ca. 0.3 to 21 h-l) at atmospheric pressure. 
The reaction temperature was normally 490 to 500’ C. The products were an- 
alysed by sampling the exit stream at suitable intervals using a gas-sampling 
valve and a gas-liquid chromatograph. Aliphatic and aromatic components up 
to ca. C,, were determined using an alumina column with temperature pro- 
gramming and flame-ionization detection. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Effect of metal component on BTXselectivity 
It was found that the incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a 
similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane (Fig. 2 ) 
. 
The 
selectivities depicted in Fig. 2 reflect infinite space velocity (zero conversion) 
conditions in order to eliminate the effect of the conversion level on selectivity. 
Actually, the latter effect does not present a serious problem in the sense that 
the overall activities of the various catalysts do not differ to any great extent. 
The infinite space velocity selectivity is, however, considered to be preferable 
when attempting to compare the behaviour of a series of catalysts in that it

does not require comparison to be made at a preselected (and arbitrary) fixed 
finite MHSV value or percentage conversion level. 
Table 2 compares data obtained from this work and from two other sources 
and indicates that the method of incorporation of zinc or gallium (impregna- 
tion or ion exchange) does not appear to have a dramatic effect on the BTX 
selectivity obtained. Further, there is a broad measure of agreement between 
the three sets of results. It is noted that the maximum quantity of zinc and 
gallium that could be incorporated into the ZSM-5 by ion exchange (via dou- 
bly-charged cations) corresponds to loadings of 2.6 and 2.8 mass-% respec- 
tively. Therefore, most of the improvement in BTX selectivity is seen for 
loadings corresponding to about 15% of the maximum obtainable for exchange 
93 
via Zn2 
+ or [Ga(OH)12+. 
No attempt was made to investigate what fraction, 
if any, of the zinc and gallium had been incorporated via ion exchange during 
the impregnation procedures employed in this work and this aspect demands 
a separate study. 
Reactivity and selectivity as a function of the alkane 
Fig. 3 reveals that over Zn-ZSM-5 
(zinc content =0.45 mass-%) i-butane 
reacts faster than n-butane, which in turn reacts faster than propane. For 
MHSV= 1 the conversions at 490°C are 56.1,32.0 and 14.1%, respectively (see 
also Table 3 
) . 
It has been noted [ 131 that propane formed during the aromatization of 
pentane over Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts requires a higher temperature to react than 
the pentane itself. Reactivity increases with an increase in molecular size of 
the alkane and i-alkanes are more reactive than n-alkanes. 
Figs. 4 to 6 indicate that the product spectrum obtained for a particular 
alkane is a strong function of the conversion level and further, that the spec- 
trum at any given conversion level is very dependent on the nature of the al- 
kane. With respect to the conversion level, the BTX selectivity increases with 
increasing percentage conversion for all three alkanes; however, the selectivity 
to (BTX + alkenes) falls with increasing percentage conversion for all three 
alkanes as alkane production steadily increases. Since alkenes are, compared 
with alkanes, more readily and more selectively (vide infra) converted to ar- 
omatics 
the results suggest that the highest selectivity 
to 
(BTX+ 
aromatizables) [lo] 
is achieved at relatively low conversions. Fig. 7 shows the 
results of extrapolation to zero conversion level of the selectivity data of Figs.

4 to 6. Clearly, propane and i-butane give almost identical and relatively high 
selectivities to (BTX + aromatizables ) 
, although propane has a greater tend- 
ency to yield methane in the C, to C, alkane side-product. With n-butane, 
however, total C1 
to C5 alkane selectivity is much higher. 
When compared at higher conversion levels (20 to 30% ), the zero conversion 
trends are somewhat modified (Table 3 ) . In addition, Table 3 contains data 
on the percentage of hydrogen lost on aromatization of the alkane, which ap- 
pears as dihydrogen. (The hydrogen lost on aromatization is calculated from 
the various stoichiometric equations depicting conversion of alkane to BTX 
plus any higher (C,, C,,) aromatics and from the actual aromatics product

distribution obtained). Overall, i-butane is associated with the lowest BTX 
selectivity, highest reactivity and highest hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. 
Compared with i-butane, n-butane is associated with a higher BTX selectivity, 
but lower reactivity and hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. With propane, reac- 
tivity is lowest, BTX selectivity is highest and hydrogen recovery as dihydro- 
gen is at a level intermediate between those displayed by the two butanes. The 
relatively low dihydrogen recovery in the case of n-butane is in line with the 
greater tendency of this alkane to produce relatively higher quantities of Cz+ 
alkanes as side-products which, as emphasized in Fig. 1, ‘consume’ a relatively 
high fraction of the hydrogen atoms lost on aromatization. 
Conversion data for propene (Fig. 8) show that BTX selectivity is in general 
markedly lower than that observed for propane, but (BTX + aromatizable ) 
selectivity is much higher. Propene exhibits a much lower tendency to produce 
C, to C5 alkanes and C1 production is especially low. 
Mechanistic considerations 
Mole et al. [ 111 have described the aromatization of alkanes in terms of a 
sequence of steps. The first involves hydride abstraction, e.g. for propane 
-H- 
&.&

Oligomerization 
and reverse oligomerization 
(cracking) 
proceed rapidly, 
yielding a range of carbenium ions:

i-C3 
HT = 
C,H,+,+, (n=3,6,9, 
etc.) 
(3) 
Aromatics may then be formed by a sequence of hydride abstraction (e.g. by 
carbenium ions) from the alkene formed by deprotonation of the species formed 
in (3) and cyclization via internal electrophilic attack. The hydride abstrac- 
tion by carbenium ions would lead to the formation of alkanes and would be 
the mechanism by which the hydrogen atoms ‘lost’ on aromatization appear as 
light alkanes. It appears from the present work that these hydrogen atoms can 
appear as dihydrogen and it is assumed that the presence of zinc or gallium 
ions, by acting as strong Lewis acid centres, offers an alternative means of 
effecting hydride transfer. Hydride ions are abstracted by these cations rather 
than by carbenium ions. In addition, the low extent of formation of methane 
observed during the aromatization of propene suggests that this alkane is not 
necessarily produced during the latter steps of aromatization but rather is the 
product of cracking processes (reverse oligomerization or direct cracking of 
the reactant alkane). The tendency for methane to be produced appears to 
depend more on the size of the reactant alkane than on the structure. Thus 
propane shows a much more marked tendency to yield methane than either 
n-butane or i-butane, both of which exhibit near-identical methane selectivities. 
It may be well that the relatively low quantity of methane that is formed 
from propene occurs almost exclusively as the result of demethylation reac- 
tions of alkyl aromatics [ 
111, although we have no direct evidence for this. 
The production of methane via the formation of ‘non-classical’ penta-coor- 
dinated carbonium ions has been proposed to occur during acid-catalysed par- 
affin cracking [ 151. 
However, the near-equal methane selectivities displayed 
by n-butane and i-butane are not readily reconciled with this mechanism and 
it is suggested that this route leads to, at most, only minor quantities of methane. 
The activity sequence displayed by the three alkanes (i-butane> n-bu- 
tane > propane) is in line with the ease of hydride transfer from the respective 
molecules. This result is consistent with the proposal [ 111 that, over Zn-ZSM- 
5 reaction, step (1) , in which the H- lost is associated with a Zn2’ centre, is 
controlling the overall rate. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The aromatization of C&/C, alkanes over ZSM-5 catalysts is greatly affected 
as far as selectivity is concerned by the incorporation of zinc or gallium. Zinc 
and gallium exert a similar effect per unit mass. 
The BTX selectivity, activity, alkane side-product composition and hydro- 
98 
gen recovery as dihydrogen are all highly dependent on the nature of the alkane 
(propane, n-butane or i-butane). 
It appears that methane is largely derived from the reactant alkane in a 
relatively early stage of the overall aromatization mechanism.
