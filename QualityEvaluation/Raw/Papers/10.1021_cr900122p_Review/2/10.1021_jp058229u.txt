Abstract
Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The present investigation was undertaken to understand the elementary redox processes involved in the formation of formaldehyde over such species. A MoOx/SiO2 catalyst was prepared with a Mo loading of 0.44 Mo/nm2. On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond. Isotopic labeling experiments in combination with in-situ Raman spectroscopy were used to examine the reducibility of the dispersed molybdate species and the exchange of O atoms between the gas phase and the catalyst. It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon. During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only ∼50−500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV. Reactions carried out using CH4 and 18O2 show that there is extensive scrambling of O atoms between the species in the gas phase and the catalyst. Additional experiments revealed that H2O formed in the reaction is the principal species responsible for the exchange of O atoms between the gas phase and the SiO2 support. Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde. A mechanism for the oxidation of CH4 over MoOx/SiO2 was formulated in light of the observations made here and is discussed in the light of previous studies. It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde. The proposed mechanism also accounts for the positive effects of low concentrations of H2O on the rate of formaldehyde formation.

Introduction
The direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde in a single step is a potentially attractive process for upgrading natural gas to a more valuable chemical feedstock. Such a process could in principle become competitive with the indirect conversion of methane to formaldehyde, which involves three separate stepssteam reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas, conversion of synthesis gas to methanol, and partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. While highly dispersed MoOx and VOx supported on SiO2 are known to be active for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, the highest single-pass yields of formaldehyde are typically on the order of 2−5%. 1-5 As a result, there is considerable interest in understanding the elementary processes involved in the formation and loss of formaldehyde, so that this knowledge might be used to prepare more highly selective catalysts.
The reaction mechanism for the conversion of methane to formaldehyde over SiO2-supported MoOx has been investigated by a number of authors, and several schemes have been proposed to explain the kinetics of methane oxidation to formaldehyde and spectroscopic observations of the catalyst.1,6-10 A common feature in these schemes is the involvement of multiple Mo centers in one or more of the elementary steps involved in transforming methane to formaldehyde. While effective in describing the observed reaction kinetics, the inclusion of such elementary steps fails to explain why the highest specific activity for MoOx/SiO2 occurs at Mo surface concentrations of <1 Mo/nm2, for which virtually all of the Mo is present as isolated molybdate species. 11-20 Since gas-phase free-radical reactions are insignificant during methane oxidation over MoOx/SiO2, 1,21 it is not clear how multiple isolated molybdate centers are able to participate in the oxidation of methane and the reduction of molecular oxygen. Observations made during experiments involving 18-labeled oxygen and during experiments in which H2O is added to the feed give rise to further questions regarding the reaction mechanism. Isotopic labeling experiments have revealed that oxygen from the SiO2 support is incorporated extensively into the oxygenated products of methane oxidation formed over SiO2-supported MoOx and VOx, 22,23 suggesting that labile SiO2 oxygen may be involved in the oxidation of CH4. Both a positive and a negative influence of H2O on the rate of CH4 oxidation has been reported for oxidation of CH4 by O2,10,24-26 but a mechanism has not been proposed to explain the chemical effect of H2O on the reaction.
The aim of the present work was to understand the elementary processes involved in the oxidation of CH4 over a MoOx/SiO2 catalyst in which the Mo is present solely as isolated molybdate species. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and O2 titration were used to determine the oxidation state of Mo after reduction by CH4, CH2O, CO, and H2. XAS was also used to monitor the oxidation state of Mo during steady-state oxidation of CH4, and O2 titration was used to determine the number of reduced centers during reaction. Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry were used simultaneously during CH4 oxidation by 18O2 and during exchange of oxygen between H218O and MoOx/SiO2 in order to investigate the transfer of oxygen between the gas phase and the catalyst during CH4 oxidation. The effect of the H2O partial pressure on the rate of CH4 oxidation was determined by varying the H2O and CH4 feed fractions during CH4 oxidation. A reaction mechanism is formulated based on the experimental results gathered here and is assessed in light of previous work.
Experimental Section
Sample Preparation. Silica gel (Silicycle R10070B-00, 60 Å pore diameter) was washed in 9 M HNO3 at 333 K, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water, and calcined in flowing air for 3 h at 973 K in order to remove alkaline earth impurities. 8,27 This treatment reduced the silica surface area from 500 m2/g to 460 m2/g, as measured by five-point analysis of the BET adsorption isotherm. MoOx/SiO2 was prepared by impregnation with an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) tetrahydrate (Aldrich, 99.98% pure). AHM (0.067 g) was suspended in 2.1 g of deionized water (150% of the pore-filling amount) for each gram of silica gel to be impregnated. The expected Mo loading was thus 3.5 wt % elemental Mo. The suspension was immersed in a bath heated at 333 K and stirred until the solvent was evaporated. The resulting solid was oven dried at 383 K overnight and calcined under flowing air at 873 K for 3 h. The surface area of the calcined catalyst was 426 m2/g. The Mo weight fraction determined by elemental analysis (Galbraith Laboratories) was 3.0% (4.5 wt % as MoO3), so that the nominal surface coverage of MoOx was 0.44 Mo/nm2.
Characterization of MoOx/SiO2 by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. The procedures used for the collection of X-ray absorption spectra at the Mo K-edge have been described previously. 28 XAS was performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beamline 2−3 using an Si(220) monochromator. MoOx/SiO2 samples were pretreated by heating at 10 K/min to 873 K in flowing 10% O2/He, holding at 873 K for 2 h, and then cooling to room temperature, after which the sample was evacuated to a residual pressure of ∼10-5 Torr. The cell was then repressurized with CH4 (Praxair UHP), 4% CO/He (Matheson certified standard), or H2 (Praxair UHP), and the sample was heated under continuous gas flow at 10 K/min to 873 K. Spectra were recorded at 873 K and were subsequently recorded in vacuo at 77 K. To investigate catalyst reduction by CH2O, the evacuated cell was heated to 473 K before introducing a flow of ∼1% CH2O/He, which was generated by flowing He (Matheson UHP) through a saturator filled with beads of solid paraformaldehyde (Aldrich, 95% pure). The saturator temperature was maintained at 331 K by recirculating heated water through a heating jacket surrounding the saturator. A Thermo Electron Neslab RTE-7 recirculating heater/chiller was used to maintain the saturator temperature. Observations of the edge energy of MoOx/SiO2 under He following air calcination and under a feed of 90% CH4/10% O2 were made in a separate set of experiments carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The energy resolution for these measurements was poorer than for those performed at SSRL because an Si(111) monochromator was used. The areas of the pre-edge features from this set of experiments could not be compared with those gathered at higher resolution, but the edge energies could be determined by comparison with the spectrum observed in flowing 10% O2/He gathered in the same set of experiments.
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were analyzed with the Athena XAS software analysis package.28 Spectra were gathered in triplicate, aligned using the edge energy measured simultaneously for Mo foil, normalized by fitting cubic splines over the pre-edge region from −150 to −75 eV and over the postedge region from 0.5 to 16.0 A-1, and then averaged. The Autobk method was used to remove background absorption Fourier components for R < 1.0 Å using a k3-weighted transform (Rbkg = 1.0 Å) in order to obtain the EXAFS function χ(k). The k3-weighted transform of χ(k) was obtained over the region 2.5 < k < 13.2 Å-1 using a Kaiser−Bessel window.
O2 Titration of Reduced MoOx/SiO2. O2 pulse chemisorption was performed at 873 K according to established procedures.30 For samples treated under pure CH4 and pure H2, the thermal conductivity detector of an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph was used to detect O2 not adsorbed by the samples. Data points were gathered at a frequency of 5 Hz. For samples treated under CH4/O2 mixtures, the amount of O2 chemisorption was much smaller and an MKS Minilab mass spectrometer was utilized to detect O2 not adsorbed by the samples. A high sampling rate of ∼5 Hz was achieved with an accuracy setting of 8 (28 measurements per sample) by putting the spectrometer in “peak jump” mode and measuring only m/e = 32 without recalibrating m/e between scans.
Sample masses of ∼100 mg were used for treatment in pure CH4 or H2 and of ∼500 mg for samples treated in CH4/O2 mixtures. Calcined samples were loaded into a quartz microreactor,1 heated at 10 K/min to 873 K and held for 30 min, purged in pure He (Praxair UHP) for 15 min, and then exposed to pure CH4 (Matheson research grade), pure H2 (Praxair UHP), or a mixture of CH4 and O2 (Matheson UHP) for 30 min. After treatment, the sample was purged in He until the detector signal reached the baseline (∼20 min for the TCD or ∼3 min for the MS). Gas flow rates were maintained at 30 cm3(STP)/min during treatment under CH4 or H2 and at 60 cm3(STP)/min during treatment under CH4/O2 mixtures. During treatment under CH4/O2 mixtures, the reactor effluent was monitored with the mass spectrometer, to ensure that oxygen conversion was incomplete. Oxygen conversion was at most ∼ 70%. Four-way switching valves (Swagelok 40 series) were used to switch between gas flows. Square pulses of O2/He were introduced at room temperature into the He stream using a six-way crossover valve (Swagelok 40 series). A 0.421 cm3 sample loop was used to set the pulse size. For CH4- and H2-treated samples, 10.3% O2/He (Matheson certified standard) was used to generate pulses containing 1.79 μmol O2. For samples treated in CH4/O2 mixtures, 1000 ppm O2/He (Praxair certified standard) was used to generate pulses containing 17.4 nmol O2. Pulses were injected into the He stream at 2 min intervals for CH4- and H2-treated samples or at 40 s intervals for samples treated in CH4/O2. Pulses were injected until the detected area was constant for at least three consecutive pulses. The oxygen uptake was calculated from the following equation
where is the moles of O adsorbed by the sample, is the moles of O2 contained in a full pulse, N is the total number of pulses injected, Ai is the detected area of the ith pulse, and Af is the area of the final pulse, corresponding to a full pulse. Chemisorption of O2 by the H2-reduced empty reactor was small but measurable (∼0.5 μmol O), and this amount was subtracted from the amount adsorbed by H2-reduced MoOx/SiO2 samples, which was on the order of 36 μmol O. No O2 chemisorption was measurable for H2-reduced SiO2, and no O2 chemisorption was measurable for the empty reactor or for bare SiO2 treated in pure CH4 or CH4/O2 mixtures.
Characterization of MoOx/SiO2 by Raman Spectroscopy. A heated quartz microreactor containing a rotating sample holder was used for the acquisition of in-situ Raman spectra. A detailed description of this apparatus has been presented previously.28,31 Sample masses were typically 31 mg. He (Praxair UHP), CH4 (Matheson research grade), 10.3% O2/He (Matheson certified standard), and 20% 18O2/He (Isotec, >99% O2 isotopic purity) were metered into the cell using Porter 201 mass flow controllers. The mass flow controllers were calibrated at multiple points with a soap bubble meter. Flow setpoints were applied manually using a Porter PCIM-4 control unit. H218O was introduced into the He stream by directing the flow through a 15 mL gas-washing bottle (LabGlass ML-1490-710) filled with H218O (Isotec/Sigma-Aldrich, >95% O isotopic purity) at room temperature and with 1 mm glass beads (Cole-Parmer 36270-50) to raise the liquid level. All tubing and valves located downstream of the gas-washing bottle were maintained at ∼333 K to prevent condensation. Total gas flow rates were 20 or 31 cm3(STP)/min. The heated volume of the Raman cell was estimated to be 15 cm3. Four-way crossover valves (Swagelok 40 series) were used to switch between gas flows.
Deconvolution of the Raman spectra of SiO2 and MoOx/SiO2 was carried out using the procedure described in ref 28. Only the essential aspects of the procedure are summarized here. The spectra of MoOx/SiO2 were fit by summing the Lorentzian components for each of the Raman-active SiO2 and MoOx features including the SiO2 D2 feature and the MoO stretching vibration, observed at 614 and 988 cm-1, respectively, for 16O2-calcined MoOx/SiO2.13,32,33 During 18O exchange, the Mo16O band at 988 cm-1 decreased in intensity and a separate Mo18O band appeared at 938 cm-1, which increased in intensity. The fraction of the molybdenyl occupied by 16O was calculated from the fraction of the total MoO area in the 938 cm-1 peak
The D2 feature of SiO2 has been attributed to either cyclic (Si−O−)3 moieties32,34,35 or homopolar Si−Si and O−O bonds at the SiO2 surface.36,37 This band is well-resolved and is red shifted by 33 cm-1 as the 16O in the feature is replaced with 18O. Therefore, the position of the D2 band is a useful measure of the isotopic composition of the oxygen of the SiO2 surface. It was assumed that the position of the D2 peak is linearly proportional to the fraction of 18O-labeled oxygen incorporated into the structure responsible for the band. Therefore, the fraction of 16O in the feature was calculated as the accomplished change in the peak position
μD2 is the peak position of the D2 feature, and μD216 and μD218 are the peak positions of the D2 feature with pure 16O and pure 18O, respectively.
Analysis of Gas-Phase Composition during Isotope Exchange Experiments. Isotopic exchange experiments were carried out to determine the rate at which gas-phase H218O exchanges O atoms in the catalyst and the rate at which 18O is incorporated into the catalyst during CH4 oxidation by 18O2. These experiments were carried out in the Raman cell. The isotopic composition of the effluent from the Raman cell was monitored with an MKS Minilab mass spectrometer. Data were gathered in analogue mode using 16 points per mass, sweeping from m/e = 1 to 50. An accuracy setting of 5 was used (25 samples per data point), allowing the collection of 1 mass spectrum every 41 s. Peak maxima were used for quantification of partial pressures. Response factors were determined relative to He for all of the fragments of CH4, CH2O, CO, CO2, H2, O2, and H2O by multipoint calibration, and the appropriate corrections were made to the fragmentation patterns of O2 and H2O to account for the natural abundance of 18O. It was assumed that the response factors for 18O-containing fragments were identical to those of the corresponding 16O-containing fragments. CH4 produced fragments from m/e = 26 to m/e = 30 from fragment combination that interfered with the peaks of CH2O and CO and that were second order with respect to CH4 partial pressure. The apparent linear response factors of these fragments were determined from a single-point calibration at the molar fraction of CH4 employed in the feed in this study (40%). The relative response factors at m/e = 2, 12−16, 18, 20, 27−36, and 44−49 for the oxygen isotopomers of each of the components were assembled into a matrix. The Moore−Penrose inverse of this matrix was applied to each vector of relative intensities of the listed mass fragments to yield each composition vector including all of the oxygen isotopes.
Measurement of Catalytic Activity. Catalytic activity was measured using the flow reactor described previously.1 An amount of 196 mg of 0.44 Mo/nm2 MoOx/SiO2 was supported on quartz wool in a quartz tube (6 mm ID) and was heated to 873 K at 10 K/min in flowing air prior to the introduction of reactants. CH4 (Matheson research grade), O2 (Matheson UHP), and He (Praxair UHP) were metered into the flow manifold by Porter 201 mass flow controllers. H2O was introduced into the He stream by directing the flow through a 15 mL gas-washing bottle (LabGlass ML-1490−710) filled with deionized H2O. The gas-washing bottle was immersed in a bath. The H2O feed fraction was varied by adjusting the temperature of the bath, which was controlled by a Thermo Electron Neslab RTE-9 recirculating heater/chiller. An HP 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a heated 250 μL sampling loop was used to measure the composition of both the reactor feed and the reactor effluent. A 30 foot long, 1/8 in. diameter column packed with Hayesep DB 80/100 mesh was used to separate all components. The column temperature was held at 278 K for 7 min, ramped at 45 K/min to 423 K, and held at 423 K for 15 min. Eluted components were detected with a thermal conductivity detector.
Results and Discussion
Catalyst Structure. We have recently described the structural characterization of the MoOx/SiO2 sample utilized in this work by Raman spectroscopy and XAS.28 The magnitude of the k3-weighted Fourier transform of the χ(k) EXAFS spectrum of the sample contained no backscattering peaks in the range from 2.5 to 4.0 Å characteristic of Mo−Mo backscattering, demonstrating that the MoOx are isolated from each other on the SiO2 surface. The edge energy of the calcined MoOx/SiO2 was consistent with assignment of the oxidation state as MoVI. The area of the pre-edge feature in the XANES region was similar in intensity to that of (NH4)2Mo2O7, which contains octahedrally coordinated and tetrahedrally coordinated Mo in a 1:1 ratio.38 Such a pre-edge feature area is expected for pentacoordinate MoOx. The Raman spectrum exhibits only a single MoO stretch, or two MoO stretches upon partial replacement of Mo16O with Mo18O, indicating that the supported MoOx has only a single terminal oxo group.39,40 The SiO2-supported MoOx species are therefore isolated, pentacoordinated, MoVIOx moieties containing a single terminal oxo (MoO) function. This assignment is in agreement with previous studies.11-20,39-41
Reducibility of MoOx/SiO2. The reducibility of MoOx/SiO2 by CH4 and by the products of CH4 oxidation was investigated by in-situ XAS. Mo K-edge XANES spectra of MoOx/SiO2 taken during catalyst reduction with CH4, CH2O, CO, and H2 at 873 K are shown in Figure 1. For reference, XANES spectra of fully oxidized MoOx/SiO2 taken in flowing O2/He at 873 K and in a vacuum at 77 K are also shown. Edge energies were determined for each of the samples relative to Mo foil. This was done by aligning the rising slopes of the spectra in the region of 20 010−20 020 eV. The edge energy relative to Mo foil (20 000 eV) and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature are listed in Table 1 for each sample. The edge energy observed under flowing He following calcination was identical to that observed under flowing 10% O2/He, demonstrating that MoOx/SiO2 does not undergo autoreduction at 873 K. In pure CH4, the edge energy was 7.8 eV, a shift of only −0.3 eV relative to the energy of fully oxidized MoOx/SiO2, and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature decreased from 2.2 to 1.9 eV. Under 4% CO/He, an edge energy of 7.6 eV was observed and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature was identical to that observed during reduction by CH4. These results suggest that neither CH4 nor CO are capable of reducing MoOx/SiO2 significantly at 873 K. The edge energy decreased to 6.2 eV during reduction in 1% CH2O and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature decreased to 1.3 eV. An even greater decrease in the edge energy and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature was observed for reduction in H2. In this case, the edge energy decreased to 5.0 eV and the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature decreased to 0.96 eV. When a mixture of 90% CH4/10% O2 was passed over the catalyst at 873 K, the Mo K-edge shifted to 7.9 eV, only 0.2 eV lower than that observed for the fully oxidized catalyst.

On the basis of our study of MoOx/SiO2 reduction by H2 at 873 K, using the same catalyst as that used in the present work, we have shown that the MoVI cations in isolated molybdate species are fully reduced in H2 to MoIV cations.28 Thus, the shift in Mo K-edge energy from 8.1 to 5.0 eV and the reduction in the integrated intensity of the pre-edge feature from 2.2 to 0.96 eV are indicative of the complete reduction of MoVI to MoIV. Viewed in this light, the degree of MoVI reduction increases in the order CH4/O2 ≈ CH4 ≈ CO < CH2O < H2 based on the results presented in Figure 1 and Table 1. The higher effectiveness of CH2O as a reducing agent compared to CO is very likely due to the formation of H2 when CH2O decomposes under nonoxidizing conditions over MoOx/SiO2.1 The absence of a large shift in the Mo K-edge energy when the catalyst is exposed to a mixture of 90% CH4/10% O2 suggests that virtually all of the Mo remains as MoVI during the oxidation of methane.
In-situ EXAFS data of MoOx/SiO2 gathered during exposure to flowing reductants at 873 K yielded results that were qualitatively similar to those obtained from XANES data. The magnitude of the Fourier transform of the k3-weighted scattering function, χ(k), is presented in Figure 2 for MoOx/SiO2. The spectrum of calcined MoOx/SiO2 recorded under vacuum at 77 K is shown for comparison to the spectrum gathered in-situ under flowing 10% O2/He at 873 K. The spectra are qualitatively identical, and only a slight reduction in spectral intensity is observed at 873 K relative to the intensity observed at 77 K.
Figure 2 Magnitude of k3-weighted Fourier transform of χ(k) for calcined MoOx/SiO2 at 77 K recorded in vacuo following calcination in 10% O2/He and recorded in-situ at 873 K under flowing 10% O2/He, pure CH4, 4% CO/He, 1% CH2O/He, and pure H2. Not corrected for phase shift.
While an effort was made to fit the EXAFS spectra using standard techniques, it was not possible to determine a unique set of EXAFS parameters because of strong correlations between these parameters arising from both overlap of the oxygen scatterers at low R values with contributions from atomic EXAFS 42 and the uncertainty in the Debye−Waller factors of the oxygen shells of MoOx/SiO2. These difficulties are likely responsible for the conflicting findings reported previously for MoOx/SiO2.13,14 Nevertheless, the EXAFS data could still be used in a qualitative manner in order to assess the extent of molybdate reduction. Under 10% O2/He, oxygen backscattering peaks were observed in the Fourier transformed k3χ(k) spectrum at 0.75, 1.20, and 1.60 Å. Under pure CH4 and 4% CO/He, these peaks retained their shape but were decreased in intensity by ∼15%. Under 1% CH2O/He, the intensity of the peaks was reduced by ∼35% and the peaks at 0.75 and 1.20 Å became poorly resolved. Under H2, the peak intensity was ∼50% of the observed intensity under 10% O2/He. These results demonstrate a successively decreasing amount of oxygen coordinated to Mo during the reduction of MoOx/SiO2 which follows the order CH4 ≈ CO < CH2O < H2, consistent with the levels of reduction observed by XANES.
The reoxidation of MoOx/SiO2 reduced in pure H2 and CH4 was investigated by pulsed chemisorption of O2, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The pulsed chemisorption spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 treated in 90% CH4/10% O2 is also shown in Figure 3 and will be discussed later. After reduction in pure H2 at 873 K, MoOx/SiO2 takes up 1 O per Mo during titration with O2 and therefore MoIV is the stable form of H2-reduced MoOx/SiO2, as noted above.28,30 The character of the titration curve following CH4 reduction differs from that observed following H2 reduction. After H2 reduction, the chemisorption of O2 by the reduced surface was very rapid. Each pulse of O2 was almost entirely adsorbed by the catalyst until the catalyst approached saturation (∼1 O per Mo), after which the breakthrough of O2 occurred rapidly, and all of the O2 in each pulse passed through the oxygen-saturated catalyst bed. By contrast, the consumption of O2 by the CH4-reduced catalyst was slow. CH4-reduced MoOx/SiO2 did not take up entire O2 pulses but consumed part of each pulse for many pulses. There was no sharp breakthrough of O2 to indicate that the surface had been saturated with oxygen. After 45 pulses, the sample had consumed 0.55 O per Mo and was still consuming O slowly with each pulse.
Figure 3 O2 pulse chemisorption spectra for MoOx/SiO2 treated in flowing H2, CH4, and 90% CH4/10% O2 at 873 K. O2 chemisorption was conducted at 873 K with 1.79 μmol pulses of O2 for samples treated in H2 and CH4 and with 17.4 nmol pulses of O2 for the sample treated in 90% CH4/10% O2. The time axis expanded three times for the sample treated in 90% CH4/10% O2.
In-situ Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the MoOx/SiO2 in its fully oxidized state and after reduction in pure CH4. The Raman bands of SiO2 and of SiO2-supported MoOx are identified in Figure 4 based on previously published work for MoOx/SiO2 under flowing air at 920 K.13,19,32,33 The SiO2 features ω1, D1, D2, ω3, νSi-OH, ω4(TO), and ω4(LO) were observed at 450, 500, 614, 810, 975, 1051, and 1179 cm-1, respectively. The MoO bending and stretching modes δMoO and νMoO were observed at 369 and 988 cm-1, respectively. The shoulder observed at 925 cm-1 was the only feature that had not been previously assigned and is tentatively assigned to a stretching mode of Mo−O−Si bonds based on previous observations made by FTIR absorption spectroscopy. 43,44
Figure 4 Raman spectra of bare SiO2 and of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K under flowing air Raman bands. Bands are shown for SiO2 (ω1, ω3, ω4(TO), ω4(LO), D1, D2, and νSi-OH) and SiO2-supported MoOx (δMoO, νMo-O-Si, and νMoO).
Figure 5 shows the Raman spectra of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K in air, in a mixture of 90% CH4/10% O2, and in pure CH4. The Raman spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 recorded during CH4 oxidation is indistinguishable from that observed under flowing air, in agreement with a previous report.18 However, none of the Raman bands of MoOx/SiO2 are observed during treatment under pure CH4 at 920 K. Instead, an intense fluorescent background centered at about 1450 cm-1 is observed together with two peaks at 1390 and 1560 cm-1, which are attributable to amorphous carbon. 45-47 The deposition of carbon is consistent with the observation that the catalyst changes color from white to dark gray upon reduction in CH4. The carbonaceous deposit is removed by exposure to flowing air for several minutes, after which the amorphous carbon peaks and intense fluorescent background disappear, and the Raman spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 is restored, as is shown in Figure 5. Hence, CH4 reduction of MoOx/SiO2 deposits amorphous carbon on the surface, and during O2 chemisorption by CH4-reduced MoOx/SiO2, O2 reacts with the amorphous carbon, rather than with reduced Mo centers. On the basis of the XAS results, it appears that CH4 reduction of MoOx/SiO2 reduces the surface by much less than 2 e- per Mo, and therefore, amorphous carbon is deposited onto MoOx sites that remain nearly fully oxidized. The small amount of reduction observed by XAS during exposure to CH4 may result from reduction of MoOx by H2 produced during carbon deposition. Apparently, H2 reduction of the MoOx does not proceed once the MoOx are carburized, since the level of reduction was stabilized at ≪2 e- per Mo. Carbon deposition was not observed during CH4 oxidation, as can be seen by comparison of the Raman spectra presented in Figure 5. This indicates that carbon deposition is much slower than carbon removal by O2, so that during steady-state CH4 oxidation carbon deposits do not accumulate on the catalyst.

The low level of reducibility of MoOx by CH4 implies that CH4 oxidation over MoOx/SiO2 cannot proceed according to a Mars−van Krevelen mechanism in which stable surface O2- anions are removed by CH4 to yield products. For such a mechanism to produce CH2O and H2O, the surface would have to be reduced by 4 e- per CH4 converted, namely
Since the MoOx are isolated on SiO2, such a mechanism would result in the reduction of MoVI to MoII. If, instead, a mechanism involving the removal of O2- anions from two MoOx sites was postulated, as has been done in the formulation of microkinetic models for CH4 oxidation over MoOx/SiO2,1,9 then it would be expected that the reduction of MoVI to MoIV would be observed under CH4. Since the average reduction of Mo observed by XAS under CH4 at 873 K is ≪2 e- per Mo, it is inferred that CH4 is incapable of reducing MoOx/SiO2 by removing O2- anions.
O2 chemisorption was performed on MoOx/SiO2 after the catalyst was treated under CH4/O2 mixtures at 873 K in order to gage the level of catalyst reduction during steady-state CH4 oxidation. The O2-pulsed titration curve obtained after treatment of MoOx/SiO2 under 90% CH4/10% O2 is shown in Figure 3 for comparison to those obtained after H2 and CH4 treatment. The character of the O2 pulsed titration curves obtained after treatment under CH4/O2 mixtures was similar to that obtained after treatment under H2; the sample adsorbed O2 rapidly until it was saturated, after which adsorption ceased. The level of reduction observed during CH4 oxidation was very small, and pulses containing only 17.4 nmol O2 were utilized to titrate the reduced sites of ∼500 mg of MoOx/SiO2 after exposure to CH4 oxidation conditions. The amounts of reduced sites titrated after treatments at 873 K under feeds of various CH4/O2 compositions are summarized in Table 2 as the number of O atoms adsorbed per Mo atom. As the CH4 feed fraction was increased, the level of reduction of the surface increased. O2 adsorption was measurable for CH4 feed fractions ≥43%. After treatment under 90% CH4/10% O2, 340 O atoms were adsorbed per million Mo atoms. The level of reduction could also be increased by decreasing the O2 feed fraction. After treatment under 90% CH4/6.7% O2, 580 O atoms were adsorbed per million Mo atoms. When a mixture of 20% CH4/10% O2 was used, no measurable adsorption of O2 was observed. The amount of adsorption expected based on extrapolation of data gathered under CH4/O2 mixtures containing 43−90% CH4 was 53 O atoms per million Mo atoms, which was near the detection limit of the technique. This is in good agreement with the previously reported amount of O2 adsorption following treatment of MoOx/SiO2 with a loading of 2.67 wt % Mo at 873 K under 20% CH4/10% O2, which was reported as 13 nmol O/g of catalyst or 48 O atoms per million Mo atoms. 48

Isotopic Exchange of Oxygen during CH4 Oxidation by 18O2. Previous studies of CH4 oxidation over SiO2-supported oxides have determined that a large amount of the 16O of SiO2 is incorporated into the reaction products when a CH4/18O2 mixture is used as the feed and reaction products are analyzed by mass spectrometry.22,23 We have observed a similar phenomenon when a H2/18O2 mixture is reacted over MoOx/SiO2.28 Moreover, in-situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that 18O is incorporated into the exposed surface of SiO2. These studies revealed that the isotopic compositions of MoO species and H2O were in quasi-equilibrium and that H2O exchanged O atoms rapidly with the SiO2 support. A similar approach was used in the present study in order to investigate the distribution of O isotopes between the products and the catalyst when CH4 was oxidized by 18O2 over MoOx/SiO2.
The Raman spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 is shown in Figure 6 after calcination at 920 K and after 8 and 78 min of exposure to a mixture containing 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He. As the oxidation of CH4 proceeded, the intensity of the Mo16O band at 988 cm-1 decreased and the intensity of the Mo18O band at 938 cm-1 increased. After 78 min on stream, <10% of the oxygen in the MoO was 16O. The substitution of 18O by 16O in MoO bonds was accompanied by a simultaneous red shift in the D2 feature, associated with the surface of SiO2.32,34,36,37 After calcination, the position of the D2 feature was observed at 614 cm-1. After 78 min of exposure to the mixture of CH4 and 18O2, the frequency for this feature shifted to 588 cm-1, indicating that 79% of the 16O in the D2 feature had been replaced by 18O.
Figure 6 Baseline-subtracted Raman spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K after calcination in air and after 8 and 78 min under 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He. Open circles are the fit composed of the Lorentzian components shown on the abscissa. The total gas flow rate was 20 cm3(STP)/min; the catalyst mass was 31.0 mg.
Figure 7 shows the isotopic compositions of the surface MoO and SiO2 D2 features as functions of time during exposure of the catalyst to a mixture of 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He at 920 K. The isotopic compositions of the oxygen-containing products are also shown in this figure. The isotopic compositions of H2O and CO2 are identical to that of the MoO feature at all times. We have recently shown that the exchange of oxygen between H2O and MoO occurs very rapidly,28 and previous work has demonstrated the rapid exchange of oxygen between CO2 and MoOx/SiO2.22 The 16O fraction of the D2 feature of SiO2 decreases with time on stream but is significantly greater than that of the MoO feature at all times, indicating that 16O is exchanged more slowly with the SiO2 surface than with the supported MoOx species. The 16O fractions of CH2O and CO are slightly greater than that of the MoO feature for reaction times >20 min but are less than that of the D2 feature of SiO2. The 16O fraction of CH2O approaches 20% after 80 min of reaction, whereas that of MoO is <10%. This is probably the result of direct oxygen exchange between CH2O and the SiO2 surface, which is enriched in 16O relative to the MoOx at any time on stream. CO is formed via decomposition of CH2O over MoOx/SiO2,1,2 and it has been shown previously that CO does not exchange oxygen at a significant rate with MoOx/SiO2.22 As a consequence, the isotopic compositions of CH2O and CO are expected to be identical, which is what was observed.
Figure 7 Isotopic composition of oxygen in surface MoO and SiO2 D2 features and in oxygenated reaction products vs time on stream during the reaction of 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He at 920 K over MoOx/SiO2. The total gas flow rate was 20 cm3(STP)/min; the catalyst mass was 31.0 mg.
The amount of 16O incorporated into oxygenated products was estimated by integration of the molar flow rates of 16O-containing products over the duration of an experiment. Because the rate constants for exchange of oxygen between the products and the surfaces of the in-situ Raman cell were unknown, there was some uncertainty in the estimate but the amount of exchangeable oxygen was estimated as 22−30 O atoms per Mo atom. This is much more oxygen than the 5 O atoms coordinated to the supported MoOx moieties and is about equal to the amount of oxygen on the surface of MoOx/SiO2.28 Hence, in addition to the oxygen associated with the supported MoOx moieties, all of the oxygen present on the surface of the SiO2 support can be incorporated into the reaction products during CH4 oxidation.
An effort was made to ascertain whether oxygen from the SiO2 surface is incorporated into the reaction products as a direct consequence of the oxidation of CH4 or as the result of the secondary exchange of oxygen between H2O (or other oxygen-containing products) and the SiO2 surface. To this end, a comparison was made between the kinetics of oxygen exchange between the gas phase and the D2 feature of SiO2 observed during CH4 oxidation by 18O2 over MoOx/SiO2 and the kinetics observed during exposure of MoOx/SiO2 to H218O. Assuming the gas phase in the Raman cell is completely backmixed, the rate of exchange of oxygen between the oxygen of a surface feature j and gaseous H2O is given by
where rj is the (negative) rate of 16O accumulation in the surface feature j in mol min-1, nj is the total number of moles of oxygen in the surface feature j, θj is the fraction of the oxygen in surface feature j that is 16-labeled, kj is the rate constant for oxygen exchange in units of (atm min)-1, pH2O is the partial pressure of H2O, η is the fraction of oxygen in H2O that is 16-labeled, and t is time.
To isolate the kinetics of oxygen exchange with the D2 feature of SiO2, the rate of depletion of 16O from the D2 feature, −dθD2/dt, can be plotted parametrically against the kinetic group pH2O(θD2 − η) to yield the oxygen exchange rate constant kD2. Such a plot is shown in Figure 8 for oxygen exchange with the SiO2 D2 feature occurring during exposure of MoOx/SiO2 to H218O and during the reaction of 40% CH4/6% 18O2. While the data are quite noisy due to experimental error, it is clear that the rates of depletion of 16O from the D2 feature are comparable for the two processes. Linear regression of the data in Figure 8 gives values of kD2 equal to 1.9 and 2.0 (atm min)-1 for exposure of the catalyst to H218O and for CH4 oxidation by 18O2, respectively. The similarity in the values of kD2 for the two processes indicates that the incorporation of 16O into the products of CH4 oxidation occurs after these products are formed rather than during the process of their formation. If the opposite were true, then the rate of oxygen exchange would have been greater during the reaction of CH4 with 18O2 than during the exposure of the catalyst to H218O. This view is supported by the observation that the rate of exchange between H218O and the D2 feature of SiO2 was ∼0.5 μmol min-1, whereas the rate of oxygen consumption to produce products was ∼20 μmol min-1. Therefore, during CH4 oxidation by 18O2, the 16O of the SiO2 surface is exchanged into the gas phase primarily by direct exchange with H218O produced by the reaction. A small amount of direct exchange between CH2O and the surface oxygen of SiO2 probably also occurs, as evidenced by the slight enrichment in the 16O fraction of CH2O and CO relative to the 16O fraction of MoO shown in Figure 7. Since the oxygen of the SiO2 support is not involved in the redox cycles that convert CH4 to oxygenated products, the redox processes that convert CH4 to products involve only the O atoms present in the isolated MoOx species.

The solid line is the linear fit of CH4 oxidation data with a slope of 2.0 (atm min)-1; the dashed line is the linear fit of oxygen exchange data with a slope of 1.9 (atm min)-1. Derivative data were smoothed by taking moving averages over 10 samples.
Effect of H2O Addition on the Rate of CH4 Oxidation. The addition of H2O to the feed during CH4 oxidation over MoOx/SiO2 yields useful information regarding the reaction mechanism. The activity for methane conversion and the product distribution are tabulated in Table 3 vs feed fractions of CH4 and H2O at 873 K with the O2 feed fraction fixed at 10% and the contact time fixed at 0.15 s. With no H2O in the feed, the rate of CH4 consumption increased from 0.44 to 1.2 μmol/(cm3 cat s) as the feed fraction of CH4 was increased from 20 to 78%. This indicates that the kinetics of CH4 oxidation are less than first order with respect to CH4, as we have recently reported.1 As the H2O feed fraction was increased from 0 to 1.0% with the CH4 feed fraction fixed at 20% and the contact time fixed at 0.15 s, the rate of CH4 consumption increased from 0.44 to 0.77 μmol/(cm3 cat s). This large increase in CH4 conversion was accompanied by slight decreases in CH2O selectivity from 48 to 41% and in CO2 selectivity from 14 to 10% and a slight increase in CO selectivity from 38 to 48%. Increasing the feed fraction of H2O to 2.0% did not further enhance the rate of CH4 oxidation or affect the product distribution. A similar trend has been reported for CH4 oxidation by N2O over MoOx/SiO2.10 When the feed fraction of CH4 was increased from 20 to 78%, the mole fraction of H2O in the reactor effluent increased from ∼0.9 to 2.3%, so it might be expected that the addition of H2O to the 78% CH4 feed would not enhance the CH4 conversion. However, the addition of 2.0% H2O to the 78% CH4 feed did result in a large enhancement in the rate of CH4 consumption from 1.2 to 2.0 μmol/(cm3 cat s).

Summary of Observations and Discussion of Mechanism of CH4 Oxidation. The XAS and in-situ Raman observations reported here indicate that isolated molybdate species supported on SiO2 cannot be reduced significantly by CH4 at 873 K. On the other hand, significant reduction of molybdate species occurs if H2 is the reducing agent and a moderate degree of reduction is observed with CH2O. In the latter case, H2 produced via CH2O decomposition is believed to be the actual reducing agent, since CO, the other decomposition product, is ineffective for the reduction of isolated molybdate species. Oxygen titration experiments indicate that only ∼50−500 ppm of the molybdate species is reduced from MoVI to MoIV during steady-state CH4 oxidation at 873 K. These findings suggest that the oxygen atoms involved in the oxidation of CH4 to CH2O are not those coordinated with the stable molybdate species but, rather, are present in metastable structures formed via the reaction of gas-phase O2 with the molybdate species. This deduction is in agreement with that drawn from the previously reported observation that a pulse of CH4 without O2 is converted to CH2O over MoOx/SiO2 to a much smaller extent than a pulse of CH4 including O2.48
A mechanism that is consistent with the findings of the present work and with the findings of previous studies is shown in Scheme 1. The first step in the reaction network is a two-electron reduction of the isolated molybdate species by H2, which is present in small concentration under steady-state conditions as a product of CH2O decomposition.1,49,50 The MoIV cations associated with the reduced molybdate species are then oxidized by O2 to form peroxide species. The reaction of the molybdenum peroxide species with CH4 produces CH2O and H2O. Alternatively, the peroxide can react with H2 to regenerate the stable MoVI-containing molybdate species. The dissociative adsorption of CH4 on the peroxide species is taken to be reversible and quasi-equilibrated. The rate-limiting step, leading to CH2O and H2O, is the abstraction of a proton from the methoxide species formed via CH4 adsorption. The H2 shown as the reducing agent for the oxidized molybdate species is envisioned to originate from the decomposition of CH2O formed as the principal reaction product during steady-state CH4 oxidation.1
Scheme 1.  Proposed Mechanism of CH4 Oxidation at Isolated, SiO2-supported MoOx Sites
Scheme 2 is an extension of Scheme 1, which is written with the aim of explaining the increase in the rate of methane oxidation with increasing H2O partial pressure. Water is shown to hydrolyze Mo−O−Si bonds reversibly, and this reaction may be at quasi-equilibrium under reaction conditions, as suggested by isotopic labeling studies.28 With increasing concentration in the gas phase, the concentration of surface hydroxide groups would increase, thereby enhancing their availability for reaction with the methoxide species produced during the activation of methane. It should be noted that excessive addition of H2O to the feed would be detrimental, since complete hydrolysis of all Mo−O−Si bonds can lead to the removal of Mo from the support as volatile MoO2(OH)2. This phenomenon has been observed in our laboratory for MoOx/SiO2 catalysts with Mo loadings ranging from 0.2 to 9.3 Mo/nm2. 51
Scheme 2.  Proposed Mechanism of CH4 Oxidation at Isolated, SiO2-supported MoOx Sites, Including Parallel Pathways Enabled by the Presence of H2Oa
a The pathways outside of the dashed envelope are active when H2O is present in the gas phase.
The large number of surface species and reaction pathways associated with the mechanism shown in Scheme 2 precludes quantitative fitting of the scheme to the observed kinetics. Nevertheless, this reaction mechanism is consistent with the observation of a lower than first-order rise in the rate of CH4 oxidation with increasing CH4 partial pressure.1 Since the reaction of methoxide species with hydroxyl species is thought to be rate limiting, the surface concentration of methoxide species will increase with increasing CH4 partial pressure, thereby shifting the equilibrium for the reversible adsorption of CH4 to the right
The increased surface concentration of methoxide drives the rate of the reverse reaction (methane desorption), so that the increase in methoxide concentration with respect to CH4 is less than linear. Hence, the observed rate of CH4 oxidation is less than first order with respect to CH4 partial pressure. Unfortunately, the rates of reaction of the surface peroxide and surface methoxide are apparently too rapid to allow their concentrations to be quantified or even to allow their observation by in-situ Raman spectroscopy.
Scheme 1 is consistent with prior observations made in the literature. As noted above, it has been reported that a pulse of CH4 without O2 reacts over isolated Si-supported molybdate species to a much smaller extent than does a pulse of CH4 including O2.48 The authors of this study attribute the difference in reactivity for the two cases to a metastable form of surface oxygen that is incompletely reduced, such as, for example, the Mo-bound peroxide species shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Such an active form of surface oxygen is also consistent with surface potential measurements of MoOx/SiO2 made previously during CH4 oxidation. By measuring the change in surface potential under varying partial pressures of CH4 and O2, it was determined that the form of oxygen that is active for CH4 oxidation is reduced by one electron per O atom. 52 The Mo-bound peroxide proposed in Schemes 1 and 2 is representative of such a species.
Previously published schemes for CH4 oxidation, including ours, have attempted to explain the kinetics for CH4 oxidation over MoOx/SiO2 by mechanisms in which multiple oxide anions react with CH4 to yield CH2O, H2O, and a reduced catalyst.1,9,10 While such mechanisms do describe CH4 oxidation kinetics successfully,1,9 they predict a much greater level of molybdate reduction (10−20%) than is observed experimentally.1 The inability of CH4 to reduce MoOx/SiO2 significantly, as observed here by XAS, is perhaps the strongest evidence that such mechanisms are incorrect physically. Such mechanisms have also relied on the participation of multiple Mo-containing sites, which is inconsistent with the fact that the highest specific activity for methane oxidation is observed for MoOx/SiO2 catalysts in which Mo is present as the sole isolated molybdate species. Such mechanisms are inconsistent, as well, with the findings that the active form of surface oxygen is short-lived48 and reduced by one electron per O atom.52 Hence, we believe that the mechanism shown in Schemes 1 and 2 is more likely to be physically correct than previously published mechanisms.
Some precedent does exist for the existence of Mo peroxides and for their activity for the oxidation of organic molecules. Peroxide-ligated Mo complexes have been observed by Raman spectroscopy both in solution and in crystalline solids 53,54 and are known to catalyze the oxidations of alcohols, amines, and sulfides at low temperatures. 55 Furthermore, metal peroxide species have been implicated as the active surface species responsible for the oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH over Fe0.5Al0.5PO4 and have been observed by in-situ IR spectroscopy at 623 K. 56 Efforts undertaken in the course of the present study to observe peroxide species on MoOx/SiO2 by Raman spectroscopy under similar conditions were not successful, probably because of the much lower concentration of active metal in MoOx/SiO2 as compared to Fe0.5Al0.5PO4. Nevertheless, the indirect evidence for peroxide species presented above support the conclusion that the formation of such species is an essential step in the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde.
Conclusions
MoOx/SiO2 prepared with a Mo loading of 0.44 Mo/nm2 consists of isolated, pentacoordinated species containing a single MoO bond. These species are readily reduced by H2 to molybdate species containing MoIV cations, but CH4 and CO are not effective reducing agents for this process. During steady-state oxidation of CH4 to CH2O, only ∼50−500 ppm of MoVI in the catalyst is reduced to MoIV. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the active species for methane oxidation is a peroxide species formed by the reaction of O2 with the low concentration of reduced molybdate species present on the catalyst surface. As shown in Schemes 1 and 2, the activation of methane is envisioned to be reversible and at quasi-equilibrium. In this scheme, the rate-limiting step for the formation of CH2O and H2O is taken to be proton abstraction from methoxide groups formed by the dissociative adsorption of CH4 by surface peroxide groups. Isotopic tracer experiments show that H2O rapidly exchanges O atoms with the dispersed molybdate species and with the silica support. However, the oxygen of the silica support does not participate directly in the catalytic cycles that oxidize CH4. The addition of low concentrations of H2O to the feed enhances the rate of methane oxidation, and this phenomenon is ascribed to an enhancement in the concentration of surface hydroxide groups on the catalyst surface (see Scheme 2).

Figure 1 Normalized XANES spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 recorded in vacuo at 77 K following calcination in 10% O2/He and recorded in-situ at 873 K under flowing 10% O2/He, pure CH4, 4% CO/He, 1% CH2O/He, and pure H2.
Figure 2 Magnitude of k3-weighted Fourier transform of χ(k) for calcined MoOx/SiO2 at 77 K recorded in vacuo following calcination in 10% O2/He and recorded in-situ at 873 K under flowing 10% O2/He, pure CH4, 4% CO/He, 1% CH2O/He, and pure H2. Not corrected for phase shift.
Figure 3 O2 pulse chemisorption spectra for MoOx/SiO2 treated in flowing H2, CH4, and 90% CH4/10% O2 at 873 K. O2 chemisorption was conducted at 873 K with 1.79 μmol pulses of O2 for samples treated in H2 and CH4 and with 17.4 nmol pulses of O2 for the sample treated in 90% CH4/10% O2. The time axis expanded three times for the sample treated in 90% CH4/10% O2.
Figure 4 Raman spectra of bare SiO2 and of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K under flowing air Raman bands. Bands are shown for SiO2 (ω1, ω3, ω4(TO), ω4(LO), D1, D2, and νSi-OH) and SiO2-supported MoOx (δMoO, νMo-O-Si, and νMoO).
Figure 5 Baseline-subtracted Raman spectra of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K under flowing air, 90% CH4/10% O2, pure CH4, and air after CH4 treatment.
Figure 6 Baseline-subtracted Raman spectrum of MoOx/SiO2 recorded at 920 K after calcination in air and after 8 and 78 min under 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He. Open circles are the fit composed of the Lorentzian components shown on the abscissa. The total gas flow rate was 20 cm3(STP)/min; the catalyst mass was 31.0 mg.
Figure 7 Isotopic composition of oxygen in surface MoO and SiO2 D2 features and in oxygenated reaction products vs time on stream during the reaction of 40% CH4/6% 18O2/54% He at 920 K over MoOx/SiO2. The total gas flow rate was 20 cm3(STP)/min; the catalyst mass was 31.0 mg.
Figure 8 Rate of change of the 16O fraction of the SiO2 D2 feature vs the driving force pH2O(θD2 − η) during CH4 oxidation by 18O2 over MoOx/SiO2 and during the exchange of oxygen between H218O and MoOx/SiO2 at 920 K. The solid line is the linear fit of CH4 oxidation data with a slope of 2.0 (atm min)-1; the dashed line is the linear fit of oxygen exchange data with a slope of 1.9 (atm min)-1. Derivative data were smoothed by taking moving averages over 10 samples.
