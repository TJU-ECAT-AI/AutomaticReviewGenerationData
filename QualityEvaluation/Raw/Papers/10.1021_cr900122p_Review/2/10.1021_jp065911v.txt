Abstract
The mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation over Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied by means of density functional theory using the cluster modeling approach. Three types of active sites were considered:  Zn2+ ions stabilized in conventional ion-exchange sites (ZnZs), Zn2+ ions stabilized in cation sites with distantly placed aluminum ions (ZnZd), or as binuclear [ZnOZn]2+ cations (ZnOZn). A comparison of the computed energetics of various reaction paths for ethane indicates that the catalytic reaction proceeds most easily over the ZnZd sites. The enhanced Lewis acidity of these sites facilitates the subsequent heterolytic C−H bond cleavage. The most favorable proton-accepting sites are not those of the framework ring to which Zn2+ is attached, but O sites of a neighboring ring. Although the reactivity of isolated Zn2+ ions strongly depends on the distribution of framework aluminum in ZSM-5 zeolite, the adsorption of alkane molecules is only slightly influenced by this factor. After the heterolytic C−H bond cleavage step, the zinc−alkyl group and acidic proton recombine via a cyclic transition state resulting in a one-step formation of an alkene and H2. This process is both thermodynamically and kinetically preferred for isolated Zn2+ sites over the consecutive mechanism. The activation barrier for the one-step elimination reaction strongly depends on the relative position of the reacting zinc−alkyl and framework attached H+ ions. Despite initial heterolytic C−H bond dissociation being strongly favored on the [ZnOZn]2+ cations, the activation energy for the subsequent decomposition of the resulting products is high.

1. Introduction
High-silica zeolites modified with zinc are known to be effective catalysts for promoting dehydrogenation of light alkanes and aromatization of hydrocarbons. 1-3 The reaction mechanism is thought to consist of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and ring-closure steps. The modifying cations play a key role in dehydrogenation of paraffins, whereas the Brønsted acid protons catalyze oligomerization of the olefins thus produced and their subsequent aromatization. 4-10 Numerous experimental 4-14 and theoretical 15-27 studies have been devoted to investigating the active sites and mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes over zinc-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolties (Zn/ZSM-5). Despite that, the structure of the active intrazeolite Zn species and, accordingly, the mechanism of hydrocarbon activation have not been fully elucidated.
Modification of zeolite with zinc ions can in principle result in formation of various cationic species depending on the type of zeolite, its Si/Al ratio, the method of preparation of the catalyst, and the conditions of the subsequent thermochemical activation. Zn/ZSM-5 prepared using conventional techniques (incipient wetness impregnation, ion exchange in aqueous solution) can, therefore, contain (i) isolated Zn2+ ions stabilized in cation sites of the zeolite, (ii) binuclear [ZnOZn]2+ species, and (iii) intrazeolite clusters of zinc oxide. Comparison of the activity of these species for dehydrogenation of alkanes is therefore important for understanding the catalytic properties of zinc-exchanged high silica zeolites.
Most of the researchers conclude that isolated Zn2+ species are present in the cationic positions of zeolites.5-8,10-13 Using in situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption technique, Biscardi et al.6 have shown that zinc in the Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 14.5) prepared via the conventional ion-exchange technique is present as isolated Zn−Ox species located at the zeolitic exchange sites coordinated to four oxygen nearest neighbors and without next nearest Zn neighbors. Computational studies 17-20,25 on location and stabilization of Zn2+ ions in ZSM-5 report a preferential 4-fold coordination of Zn2+ to the zeolite oxygens.

Scheme 1:  Possible Reaction Paths for Ethane Dehydrogenation
The first theoretical study of the reaction paths of ethane dehydrogenation on a Zn2+ cation stabilized in a four-membered zeolitic ring has been reported in ref 17. It was concluded that the so-called “alkyl” path (Rδ-−Hδ+) of ethane activation is strongly favored over the “carbenium” mechanism (Rδ+−Hδ-). A three-step mechanism was proposed that included (i) heterolytic C−H bond cleavage, resulting in formation of a zinc−ethyl group and a Brønsted acid proton, (ii) subsequent elimination of molecular ethylene via abstraction of a hydrogen attached to β-carbon of the grafted C2H5 fragment, and (iii) hydrogen desorption via recombination of the acidic proton and the hydride ion attached to zinc. The initial heterolytic dissociation of ethane on a Zn2+ ion stabilized in cluster models representing different cation sites of ZSM-5 zeolite was later investigated by Shubin et al.18
Binuclear [ZnOZn]2+ extra framework species were also suggested to account for the experimentally observed overexchange phenomena in Zn/ZSM-5.6 Recently, Penzien et al. 28 have identified such species in high-silica zeolite BEA modified with zinc. These species have been theoretically investigated using either the cluster16,22 or the periodic23,24 approach. It was shown that the [ZnOZn]2+ cations are rather reactive toward alkane and hydrogen dissociation. However, to our knowledge a complete investigation of the catalytic light alkane dehydrogenation reaction over such binuclear sites has not been reported until now.
Recently a new and completely anhydrous route for the preparation of well-defined Zn cationic species via a high-temperature reaction of parental HZSM-5 with zinc vapor has been proposed. 29-31 This technique results in a complete and selective substitution of zeolitic protons with bivalent zinc cations. The resulting Zn/Al ratio is 1/2. Due to the lack of oxygen source, formation of any oxygen-containing intrazeolite zinc species is not possible. It was also assumed that bivalent Zn2+ cations can be stabilized at one anionic site of the zeolite with a distantly located second charge-compensating [AlO2]- framework unit. The indirect charge compensation of Zn2+ ions at such cationic sites results in a significant enhancement of their Lewis acidity.
Adsorption of H2, 32-36 CH430, and C2H610,31 by Zn/ZSM-5 was studied using diffuse-reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Large red shifts were observed for the adsorbed molecules. In addition, after a moderate elevation in temperature, their heterolytic dissociation was detected.30-34 This was explained by a promoted activation of adsorbed molecules on the above-mentioned strong Lewis-acid active sites. This assumption has been subsequently supported by quantum-chemical calculations.20,21,26 Formation of strongly activated molecular adsorption complexes, as well as their subsequent dissociation, has been observed for Zn/ZSM-5 zeolites independently of the method of preparation.

Despite all the data available, the nature of the active site and the mechanism of the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes are still debatable.14,27 In the present work we have used density-functional theory (DFT) to clarify these questions. We chose ethane dehydrogenation as a model reaction. Two different reaction paths have been considered (Scheme 1). At the initial step for both paths, molecular adsorbed ethane (I) dissociates following the alkyl mechanism. The resulting intermediate II can be decomposed via elimination of ethylene (II→III→IV) with the subsequent hydrogen recombination from intermediate IV (outer cycle in Scheme 1), similarly to the mechanism proposed in ref 17. One could also imagine that the reaction could proceed via an alternative route (inner cycle in Scheme 1) that is a one-step process resulting in desorption of H2 and formation of a molecular complex V of ethylene with the active site. To our knowledge such a mechanism has never been considered for the dehydrogenation reactions. Both mechanisms have been studied for three different representations of the active sites in Zn/ZSM-5:  binuclear [ZnOZn]2+ ion; isolated Zn2+ stabilized in the convention ion-exchange site of the zeolite; in the cation site with distantly separated framework aluminums. Below, these sites are designated as ZnOZn, ZnZs, and ZnZd, respectively. The notations for the intermediates and transition state structures will be according to the numbering used in Scheme 1 with the corresponding active site given in the subscript.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The computational details are presented in section 2 and the results of the calculations are summarized in section 3. We consider molecular ethane adsorption, heterolytic C−H bond cleavage, elimination of the products of dehydrogenation, and full catalytic cycles for different mechanisms of ethane dehydrogenation over different active sites, in this order. In section 4 we discuss the results obtained and compare them with the experimental data, while section 5 summarizes conclusions of our work.
2. Computational Details
The ZSM-5 framework represents different interconnected ring structures composed of either silicon or aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedrons, which are so-called T sites. There are 12 nonequivalent T-sites in the full silica MFI framework. Isomorphous substitution of a silicon with an aluminum ion results in formation of a local negative framework charge, which is then compensated with an exchanged cation or proton. In addition, such substitution removes the crystal symmetry, making all the 96 T sites of a unit cell nonequivalent. The mechanistic DFT study involving such a large unit cell is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, although the exact properties calculated by different approaches can vary, no qualitative difference or alternative paths of chemical reactions were observed when studied by means of cluster and periodic DFT modeling. 37-39 Since the emphasis of this study is on a comparative investigation of the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation, the application of periodic boundary conditions is assumed to not significantly affect our conclusions.

Dehydrogenation of ethane over Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using ZnAl2Si6O9H14 and Zn2OAl2Si6O9H14 cluster models (Figure 1), which represent two adjacent five-membered rings from the wall of the straight channel of ZSM-5 zeolite. Aluminum atoms were placed in T12 and T8 lattice positions 40 to model the charge-alternating cation site Zd with distantly separated [AlO2]- framework units (Figure 1, a and c). The next nearest T12 and T6 lattice positions were occupied with aluminum atoms for the modeling of a conventional ion-exchange site Zs (Figure 1b). The distance between two aluminum ions was equal to 8.14 Å for the Zd cluster and 4.84 Å for the Zs cluster model. Note that the T12 site is located at the cross-section of the straight and the sinusoidal channel of ZSM-5; accordingly, the cations stabilized in the vicinity of this site are considered to have the highest accessibility. Therefore, the charge-compensating Zn2+ cation was placed in the five-membered ring containing aluminum at the T12 position. Hydrogen atoms were used to saturate the dangling Si−O bonds at the periphery of the cluster. The starting geometry of the clusters corresponded to the lattice of the ZSM-5 zeolite according to X-ray diffraction data. 41
Density functional theory (DFT), with the B3LYP 42 hybride exchange-correlation functional, was used to perform all of the calculations. Earlier, the B3LYP method has been reported to provide excellent descriptions of various reaction profiles and in particular of geometries, heats of reaction, activation energies, and vibrational properties of various molecules. 43 Geometry optimization and saddlepoint searches were all performed using the Gaussian 03 program. 44 The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was used for zinc ions, whereas the ethane molecule and the zeolitic oxygen atoms were described by the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Al and Si atoms of the zeolite framework, as well as the boundary hydrogen atoms, were treated by the D95-Dunning/Huzinaga basis set. It was shown earlier that such a combination is a successful compromise for studies of zinc-exchanged zeolites.20,21,26

Special restrictions on the positions of the boundary H atoms were imposed during the procedure of optimization, as described previously in refs 20, 21, 26. In short, the structure of the initial zeolite cluster was first constrained to the X-ray diffraction data.41 Subsequently, only Si−H and Al−H bond lengths and the position of the exchanged cation were optimized, whereas positions of all of the other atoms, as well as the directions of the bonds, were fixed according to crystallographic data. The positions of the terminal H atoms in all subsequent calculations were then fixed, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms were optimized.
All energies obtained from the DFT calculations used for the estimation of the reaction heats and activation barriers were corrected for the zero-point energy obtained from frequency calculations performed on all the optimized structures. The frequency calculations also provided us with the thermochemical analysis using the ideal gas approximation at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 298.15 K. The values of ΔG0 reported for selected reactions were calculated at these conditions. Although the use of basis sets of different quality for different atoms of the model can cause relatively high basis set superposition error (BSSE), the contribution of the BSSE to the reaction energies and activation energies is expected to be small and similar for all the structures discussed and, hence, not to affect the conclusions drawn. Thus, the energetics reported were not corrected for BSSE.
The nature of the stationary points obtained was tested by analyzing the analytically calculated harmonic normal modes. During the normal-mode analysis, constraints on the boundary H atoms result in imaginary frequencies (negative force constants). The imaginary frequencies could be suppressed by removing the contributions from the constrained atoms to the Hessian matrix for all the reaction intermediates. All of the transition states showed only a single imaginary frequency corresponding to the eigenvector along the reaction path. The assignment of the transition state structure to a particular reaction path was tested by perturbing the structure along the reaction path eigenvector in both directions of the products and the reagents with subsequent geometry optimization of the resulting models.
3. Results
Figure 1 displays the optimized structures of ZnZd, ZnZs, and ZnOZn models with the corresponding optimized Zn−O bond lengths given in Table 1. The structural parameters show that in either ZnZd or ZnZs sites, Zn2+ ion coordinates to four adjacent zeolitic oxygen atoms. Lattice oxygen atoms bound to Al atoms are more basic compared to those from the [SiO2] framework units. This results in slightly shorter Zn−O1 and Zn−O2 distances for the ZnZd structure. Although in the ZnZs all of the O atoms coordinated to zinc are basic, slightly shorter Zn−O bonds are formed with O2 and O4 atoms, most likely due to the steric properties of the cation site. For the ZnOZn structure, each 5T ring of the model is occupied by Zn2+ cations connected via the extra-lattice oxygen atom O10. The Zn−O interatomic distances are very close for both zinc ions reflecting their similar chemical properties. For this reason, ethane activation was studied only on one of the Zn atoms, namely Zn1 in Figure 1c.
3.1. Molecular Adsorption. The ethane molecule adsorbed on the exchanged cation is a precursor for the subsequent heterolytic C−H bond cleavage. C2H6 coordinates to the cation sites with two hydrogen atoms from one methyl group (η2-coordination) as shown in Figure 2 (IZnZd, IZnZs, and IZnOZn). The strongest adsorption (53 kJ/mol) is found for the ZnZd site (structure IZnZd), while coordination of C2H6 to the ZnZs site is twice weaker (IZnZs, 26 kJ/mol). This reflects the higher Lewis acidity of the zinc ion at the Zd site due to the indirect charge-compensation with distantly placed anionic sites, compared to the case when aluminum atoms are located at the next nearest lattice positions. In the case of the ZnOZn species, charge compensation is even more pronounced, since an extra-framework oxygen atom (O10) connects zinc ions in the complex. It results in very weak (11 kJ/mol) ethane adsorption (IZnOZn). Although the coordination of C2H6 to zinc ions does not dramatically alter the structure of the adsorption site, for the ZnZs and ZnZd sites the Zn−O distances become somewhat longer (Table 2). More important are changes observed in the geometry of the C2H6 species. The C−H bonds directly interacting with the cation are significantly elongated in comparison with the corresponding bonds of gas-phase ethane. The effective transfer of electron density from ethane to the ZnZd and ZnZs sites equals 0.115 and 0.052 electrons, respectively. In the case of the ZnOZn site, practically no charge transfer is observed. This is due to the more effective shielding of the zinc cation by the bridging O10 oxygen atom. In this case the main contribution to the adsorption energy is provided by induced polarization of C2H6, whereas charge transfer dominates bonding in the adsorption complexes with the ZnZs and ZnZd sites. Thus, there is a qualitative correlation between ethane adsorption energies, the elongation of the interacting C−H bonds, and the Lewis acidity of the cation.
Coordination of ethane to the positively charged adsorption sites affects also its vibrational properties. Calculated IR spectra of C−H stretching vibrations of the C2H6/ZnZd (IZnZd), C2H6/ZnZs (IZnZs), and C2H6/ZnOZn (IZnOZn) complexes in comparison with the gas-phase ethane are shown in Figure 3. All of these spectra contain a number of slightly perturbed IR bands with frequencies close to those calculated for the gas phase (3030−3130 cm-1). These bands correspond mainly to the displacements of H-atoms from the C−H bonds, which do not interact directly with the adsorption site. In addition, for each of the complexes, one IR band (at 2827, 2849, and 2965 cm-1, respectively, for the ZnZd, ZnZs, and ZnOZn sites) is strongly red-shifted and exhibits a higher relative intensity compared to the other C−H stretching bands. This IR band corresponds to the perturbed symmetric C−H stretch that originates from the ν1 (a1g) mode with the strongest contribution of the displacements of the H1 and H2 atoms (see Figure 2). In the case of the C2H6/ZnZd complex (IZnZd) a very weak absorption band at 2956 cm-1 corresponds to the asymmetric vibration of the H1−C1−H2 moiety originating from the ν10 (eg) vibrational mode of gaseous ethane. The weak interaction of C2H6 with the ZnOZn site results in only a slight perturbation of the adsorbed molecules. On the other hand, the higher Lewis acidity of the low-coordinated zinc ions in Zs and Zd sites leads to more pronounced perturbations of the C2H6 species.
In summary, the C2H6 adsorption energy decreases significantly in the order ZnZd, ZnZs, ZnOZn. Coordination of ethane to a [ZnOZn]2+ cation is very weak and to be considered as a physical adsorption process. On the other hand, the interaction of C2H6 with the isolated Zn2+ stabilized in the cation site of ZSM-5 is stronger and mainly consists of charge transfer from the adsorbed molecule to the cation. This results in significant geometry changes and charge redistribution in the C2H6 species on the ZnZd and ZnZs sites. Both these effects influence the vibrational spectrum of the adsorbed species leading to a strong red shift of some of the absorption bands as well as an increase of their relative intensities. However, the differences in simulated spectra of IZnZd and IZnZs are not very pronounced. In agreement with the earlier proposal, 31,45 we found that the C−H stretching vibration that originates from the fully symmetric ν1 (a1g) mode of C2H6 is the most sensitive to the nature of the adsorption site.
3.2. Heterolytic C−H Bond Cleavage. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane results in the formation of a hydroxyl group and zinc−alkyl fragment (II). Two different reaction paths are possible over the isolated Zn2+ sites (ZnZd and ZnZs), which differ in the mechanism of H-abstraction from C2H6 involving either O4 or O6 zeolite oxygen. Only one pathway for heterolytic ethane dissociation over the ZnOZn is found, where hydrogen atom (H1) is abstracted by the bridging oxygen (O10) resulting in destruction of the [ZnOZn]2+ dimer and formation of [Zn−C2H5]+ and [Zn−OH]+ species. Other reaction paths over the ZnOZn are not found.
The energetics of the respective mechanisms are presented in Figure 2. The dissociative adsorption of C2H6 on Zn2+ ions at either the Zs or Zd sites is endothermic (ΔE = 59 − 142 kJ/mol depending on the active site), while C−H bond cleavage over the ZnOZn is an exothermic process (IIZnOZn, ΔE = −67 kJ/mol). In addition, the latter process exhibits the lowest activation energy (TS1ZnOZn, ΔE⧧ = 77 kJ/mol). C−H bond cleavage over the bare Zn2+ ions in either Zs and Zd clusters results in the loss of the stable 4-fold coordination of zinc to zeolitic oxygens (Table 2). Formation of the Zn−C bond cannot compensate for the energy loss from the breaking of strongly stabilizing Zn−O bonds.
In the case of the ZnZs site abstraction of a proton by the oxygen atom (O4), to which Zn is attached (IZnZs→TS1ZnZs→ IIZnZs), is both thermodynamically and kinetically the most favorable reaction. The activation energy and the enthalpy of this reaction are by 46 and 29 kJ/mol, respectively, lower as compared to those of the reaction path (IZnZs→TS1‘ZnZs→II‘ZnZs) leading to formation of the Brønsted acid site (O6−H1) in the empty zeolitic ring (Figure 2).
When Zn2+ is stabilized at the charge-alternating site (ZnZd), C−H bond cleavage results in formation of [Zn−C2H5]+ and [H+] species attached, respectively, to different zeolitic rings (IZnZd→TS1‘ZnZd→II‘ZnZd). This path leads to the formation of the most stable product II‘ZnZd (ΔE = 59 kJ/mol) and faces the lowest activation energy (TS1‘ZnZd, ΔE⧧ = 117 kJ/mol) among C2H6 dissociation pathways over the isolated Zn2+ sites. Another reaction path (IZnZd→TS1ZnZd→IIZnZd) gives a less stable product IIZnZd containing two neighboring positively charged species. Note that in this case the newly formed O4−H2 or O6−H1 bonds are rather weak due to the low basicity of the oxygen atoms from the silicon-occupied oxygen tetrahedrons. In contrast, the O4−H2 bond formed at the anionic site of the zeolite due to the C−H activation over the ZnZs site (IZnZs→TS1ZnZs→IIZnZs) is much stronger compared to the O6−H1 (IZnZs→TS1‘ZnZs→II‘ZnZs). The energy gain due to the formation of a stronger chemical bond compensates more effectively for the energy loss due to the decrease of the coordination of the exchanged cation and repulsion of the likely charged species. This, in turn, results in higher stability of the product IIZnZs compared to II‘ZnZs.
3.3. Decomposition of the Grafted Ethyl Species. The next reaction step toward catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over Zn/ZSM-5 consists of decomposition of the [Zn−C2H5]+ species with consecutive ethylene desorption. The generally accepted mechanism for this process is the β-scission reaction shown in Scheme 2.17,21,31 Abstraction of a hydride ion from the β C-atom of the ethyl group by zinc results in the formation of a zinc hydride and molecular ethylene. Stretching of the Znδ+−Cδ- bond of the grafted C2H5 group enhances polarization of this bond and therefore increases the Lewis acid strength of the Zn cation. The Zn ion polarizes the β-C−H bond of the ethyl fragment, resulting in an abstraction of the hydride ion and desorption of ethylene.
The energetics of this process are presented in Figures 4, 5, and 6 for the products of dissociative C2H6 adsorption (II and II‘) on ZnZd, ZnZs, and ZnOZn, respectively. All of these reactions are endothermic and show rather high activation barriers. The energetic parameters for the C2H4 elimination from structures IIZnZd and II‘ΖnZd (IIZnZd →IIIZnZd and II‘ZnZd →III‘ZnZd, Figure 4) are similar. The calculated activation energies (ΔE⧧) are equal to 180 and 194 kJ/mol, respectively, for the decomposition of IIZnZd and II‘ZnZd. The geometry parameters for the respective transition states are also very similar (Table 3). Thus, in the case of ethane dissociation over ZnZd site, the subsequent ethylene desorption does not remarkably depend on the relative position of the zinc site and the zeolitic Brønsted acid site. On the other hand, in the case of the ZnZs site, the zinc ion from the [Zn−C2H5]+ group in II‘ZnZs is coordinated to four zeolitic O atoms (Table 4). Two of these coordination bonds (Zn−O4 and Zn−O5) are broken in the corresponding transition state structure (TS2‘ZnZs), resulting in a very high activation barrier (257 kJ/mol) for the β-scission process. However, when both proton and zinc−alkyl fragment are located in the same ring of the ZnZs (IIZnZs), no additional loss of coordination of zinc atom to O atoms is required (Table 4). Both the activation energy and the energy change for the C2H4 elimination in this case (IIZnZs→IIIZnZs:  ΔE = 67 kJ/mol, ΔE⧧ = 192 kJ/mol, Figure 5) are found to be similar to those calculated for the ZnZd site (Figure 4). For the third type of active site (ZnOZn), decomposition of the grafted ethyl group (IIZnOZn→IIIZnOZn, Figure 6) is more endothermic (ΔE = 99 kJ/mol), while the activation barrier is comparable to the reactions discussed above (ΔE⧧ = 190 kJ/mol).

All of the above β-H-transfer reactions result in the formation of zinc hydride species with ethylene adsorbed to them (III). The strongest coordination of C2H4 to [Zn−H]+ ion is found for structures IIIZnZd and IIIZnZs with closely located zinc and acidic proton. The corresponding adsorption energies are equal to 55 and 33 kJ/mol, respectively. The lower adsorption energy for the Zs case is due to the lower Lewis acidity of the exchanged cation. For the distant location of the zinc site and the acidic proton in structure III‘ZnZd the ethylene adsorption is much weaker (16 kJ/mol), whereas no similar adsorption complex with the zinc−hydride ion at the Zs site (IV‘ZnZs) was identified. Most likely, this is due to higher coordinative saturation of the zinc ion in structures IV‘ZnZd and IV‘ZnZs.
Although C2H4 can bind in principle to intermediate IVZnOZn, it does not result in any remarkable energy change (see IIIZnOZn→ IVZnOZn, Figure 6). Most likely, due to a very low Lewis acidity of this zinc site, the stabilization of the adsorbed ethylene can only be provided by formation of very weak CH···O contacts with framework O atoms. However, such dispersive interactions cannot be correctly described within the computational method used. 46
The energies of C2H4 adsorption to the zinc−hydride fragments correlate very well with the enthalpies of the β-scission reactions:  the stronger the ethylene adsorption, the less endothermic the reaction. Thus we conclude that the stability of the zinc−hydride species apparently does not depend on the local surrounding, while the thermodynamics of the β-H transfer is mainly controlled by the strength of the C2H4 interaction with the [Zn−H]+ ion in the corresponding reaction product.
At the next step of the catalytic cycle, H2 is being removed via recombination of an acidic proton and a hydride ion bound to Zn2+ (IV and IV‘). The corresponding reaction paths as well as their energetics are shown in Figures 4−6. Recombination of H2 at ZnZd and ZnZs sites (Figures 4, 5) is an easy process and shows activation energies (ΔE⧧) in the range of 34−41 kJ/mol, depending on the relative stability of the [Zn2+−H-···H+]2+ species. We could not locate a transition state structure for the H2 recombination from intermediate IV‘ZnZs. Dihydrogen desorpiton from IVZnOZn (Figure 6) is a highly activated process (ΔE⧧ = 146 kJ/mol) because of the strong strains of the resulting ZnOZn site.
A very interesting peculiarity is observed for H2 recombination from the closely located H+ and [Zn2+−H-]+ species in the intermediate IIIZnZd. Coordination of C2H4 to zinc ion results in loss of the activation barrier for the hydrogen removal (IIIZnZd→VZnZd). Indeed, the charge-donation from adsorbed ethylene to zinc results in a weakening of the Zn−H bond. At the same time the O−H bond in this structure is weak due to rather low basicity of the corresponding O4 atom in the Zd site. Both these factors along with the rather short distance between the H- and H+ species result, already in structure IIIZnZd, in a direct interatomic interaction between these two unlikely charged ions. This strongly facilitates the subsequent H2 desorption, resulting in formation of a strong π-complex of ethylene with the low-coordinated Zn2+ ion. A similar effect is also observed for the ZnOZn site (IIIZnOZn→VZnOZn). However, in the latter case due to the significantly weaker bonding of C2H4 to the [ZnOZn]2+ ion, this effect is less pronounced.
Besides consecutive formation of C2H4 and H2, an alternative reaction path leading to closure of the ethane dehydrogenation catalytic cycle is a one-step decomposition of the product of C2H6 dissociative adsorption (II) via a cyclic transition state (Scheme 3). A similar mechanism has been recently discussed by us 47 for decomposition of [H−Ga−C2H5]+ species in GaZSM-5 zeolite. This pathway has been found to be more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically than the β-H-transfer. The related mechanism could be also applicable to Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite. The corresponding reaction paths are shown in Figure 7, while Table 6 lists geometry parameters of the intermediates and the transition states involved.

For the isolated Zn2+ sites, independently of the relative location of [Zn−C2H5]+ and H+ species, this process (IIZnZd→VZnZd and II‘ZnZd→VZnZd) is characterized by smaller values of reaction enthalpy and lower activation energies as compared to the corresponding β-scission reactions. Table 7 lists the calculated Gibbs energy changes for the respective reactions (Table 7). The values of ΔG°298 for the one-step reaction over ZnZd and ZnZs are negative, whereas the corresponding parameters for the β-H transfer reactions are strongly positive.
Formation of cyclic transition states (TS4‘ZnZd and TS4‘ ZnZs) from the distant H+ and zinc−ethyl groups (II‘ZnZd and II‘nZs) demands less energy (ΔE⧧ = 145 and 105 kJ/mol, respectively) than from the intermediates containing these species in one zeolite ring (IIZnZd→TS4ZnZd→VZnZd:  ΔE⧧ = 166 kJ/mol; IIZnZs→TS4ZnZs→VZnZs:  ΔE⧧ = 155 kJ/mol). This effect is due to steric reasons. When both the proton and zinc−ethyl groups are located closer, stronger deformations are required to form the cyclic transition state structure corresponding to the one-step C2H4/H2 elimination. This explains why for the ZnOZn site, this reaction path is less favored as compared to the β-scission reaction (IIZnOZn→TS4ZnOZn→VZnOZn:  ΔE⧧ = 253 kJ/mol and IIZnOZn→TS2ZnOZn→IIIZnOZn:  ΔE⧧ = 190 kJ/mol, respectively).
3.4. Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Ethane. So far we have presented the calculated results for the different elementary reaction steps that are parts of the reaction cycle of catalytic C2H6 dehydrogenation. In order to compare the overall catalytic activity of the different zinc sites and to clarify the preferred reaction paths, below we compare the reaction energy diagrams of the catalytic pathways on the active sites considered.
The calculated energetics for catalytic ethane dehydrogenation over ZnZd site are presented in Figure 8. It was shown in section 3.1 that the initial proton abstraction resulting in formation of a distantly separated zinc−alkyl group and Brønsted acid site (I→II‘, Figure 8b) is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically over the respective pathway resulting in formation of these species in the same zeolitic ring (Figure 8a). Indeed the apparent activation energy for the former reaction is by 33 kJ/mol lower, while the corresponding product II‘ZnZd is by 50 kJ/mol more stable as compared to IIZnZd (Figure 8, b and a, respectively). However, in practice the dehydrogenation of light alkanes takes place at rather high temperature, and, in spite of the difference in the energetics of the initial C−H bond activation, the catalytic process can be driven by the subsequent steps.
Figure 8 Ethane dehydrogenation over ZnZd with initial proton abstraction to the O4 (a) and O6 (b) site.
Independent of the mechanism of the initial C−H bond cleavage, subsequent one-step decomposition of the zinc−alkyl fragments (II→V+H2 and II‘→V+H2, Figure 8) is preferred over the consecutive elimination of C2H4 and H2 (II→III and II‘→III‘). In the case of location of [Zn−C2H5]+ and H+ ions in the same zeolite ring (II) the activation energies for both these processes are very close. Nevertheless, the one-step reaction is strongly favored thermodynamically (Table 7) and results in a very stable intermediate VZnZd. For the distantly separated zinc−ethyl fragment and an acidic proton, the one-step formation of C2H4 and H2 faces about a 50 kJ/mol lower activation barrier and also is thermodynamically favorable.
Thus, the most favorable pathway for the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over the ZnZd site consists of the following steps. After the molecular adsorption of C2H6 on the exchanged Zn2+ cation, the heterolytic C−H bond cleavage takes place. Subsequent decomposition of the thus-formed grafted alkyl group with simultaneous H2 desorption via the cyclic transition state results in formation of a stable adsorption complex of ethylene with the extra-framework zinc cation. This reaction is the rate-limiting step. Desorption of ethylene closes the catalytic cycle. The calculated apparent activation energy for the catalytic cycle over Zn2+ stabilized at the charge-alternating cation site is equal to 153 kJ/mol.
Figure 9 shows the calculated pathways for ethane dehydrogenation over the ZnZs site. In contrast to the case of ZnZd, formation of [Zn−C2H5]+ and H+ ions in one zeolitic ring (I→II, Figure 9a) via initial C−H bond cleavage is more favored due to higher stability of the proton bound to the aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedron. As for the other processes, the trends are the same as those discussed above. The one-step decomposition reactions of intermediates IIZnZs and II‘ZnZs (II→V+H2 and II‘→V+H2, Figure 9) are more favorable than the hydride abstraction reactions (II→III and II‘→III‘). The height of the activation barrier (TS4ZnZs and TS4‘ZnZs) for the former reaction strongly depends on the relative position of the reacting [Zn−C2H5]+ and H+ species, whereas no apparent correlation between the nature of the O site to which a proton is attached and the energetics of this reaction are observed. However, the apparent activation energies for the catalytic process are very similar for both mechanisms of the initial heterolytic dissociation (Figure 9, a and b). The corresponding calculated values are equal to 226 and 222 kJ/mol, respectively for the IZnZs→IIZnZs and IZnZs→II‘ZnZs mechanisms of the initial C−H bond cleavage.
Figure 9 Ethane dehydrogenation over ZnZs with initial proton abstraction to the O4 (a) and O6 (b) site.
The reaction energy diagrams for catalytic C2H6 dehydrogenation over the binuclear ZnOZn site are shown in Figure 10. The high exothermicity of the initial dissociative ethane adsorption (I→II) is due to high reactivity of bridging oxygen and strong steric strains in the [ZnOZn]2+ cations which are removed via cleavage of one of the Zn−O bonds. The resulting product IIZnOZn is very stable, and therefore the subsequent transformations demand higher energies. In contrast to the above-discussed active sites, the one-step C2H4 and H2 desorption (II→V+H2) in this case is found to be both thermodynamically and kinetically less favorable than the β-H atom abstraction from the grafted ethyl group by zinc ion (II→III). The respective activation energies differ by 63 kJ/mol, while the products of the latter reaction (IIIZnOZn) are by 68 kJ/mol more stable than the structure VZnOZn.
Figure 10 Ethane dehydrogenation over ZnOZn.
The intermediate IIIZnOZn is unstable. Although coordination of ethylene to zinc−hydride ion in structure (IIIZnOZn) can in principle promote H2 desorption (TS5ZnOZn), it rather decomposes via reaction IIIZnOZn→IVZnOZn. The catalytic cycle closes via recombination of a hydride ion from Zn−H species and a proton. The apparent activation energy for the lowest-energy pathway of ethane dehydrogenation over ZnOZn is very close to the respective value for the ZnZd site (166 and 153 kJ/mol, respectively). However, the former process proceeds via formation of a very thermodynamically stable intermediate IIZnOZn and a relatively high energy is required to decompose it. Therefore, one can expect that the catalytic cycle will be significantly slowed since the equilibrium will be shifted to the structure IIZnOZn for IIZnOZn↔IIIZnOZn reaction (Table 7).
4. Discussion
In the present study we consider three different possible types of charge-compensating zinc species in Zn/ZSM-5:  isolated Zn2+ stabilized in either charge-alternating (Zd) or conventional ion-exchange cation site (Zs) and oxygen-bridged dimeric [ZnOZn]2+ cation. C2H6 specifically adsorbs on ZnZd and ZnZs sites (structures IZnZd and IZnZs, respectively), whereas ethane coordination to the [ZnOZn]2+ cation is very weak (Eads = 11 kJ/mol) and corresponds to physical adsorption (structure IZnOZn). The calculated ethane adsorption energy on ZnZd is almost twice as high as the corresponding value for the ZnZs model (56 and 26 kJ/mol, respectively). The strong interaction is accompanied with large changes in the geometric and charge properties of the adsorbed species. As a result the calculated IR spectra of the C−H stretching vibrations significantly differ from those for the gas-phase ethane as well as for the weak adsorption complex IZnOZn. Both spectra contain a strongly red-shifted and intense IR band corresponding to the vibration originated from the ν1 (a1g) stretching mode of gaseous ethane.
Recently a detailed experimental study of molecular and dissociative adsorption of ethane on Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite has been performed by Kazansky and Pidko.31 The catalyst used was prepared by a high-temperature reaction of zinc vapor with the parental hydrogen form of the zeolite. This method allows selective and quantitative (one zinc atom per two framework aluminums) substitution of zeolitic Brønsted acid sites with isolated Zn2+ cations at the cation sites of ZSM-5. Due to the absence of any source of O2 or water during the preparation of Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite by this method, formation of any oxygen-containing cationic species ([ZnOZn]2+, [Zn−OH]+, etc.) is prohibited. On the other hand, when traditional techniques such as incipient wetness impregnation or ion exchange in water solution are used for preparation of zeolite modified with zinc, one cannot exclude formation of such species, as well as small zinc oxide particles or other multinuclear assembles within the zeolite channels. However, comparison of different zinc-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites prepared using different techniques has shown that the behavior of the adsorbed alkane molecules does not depend on the method of zinc loading into zeolite.30,31 Moreover, it was shown by Heemsoth et al. 48 that the catalysts prepared via the conventional incipient wetness impregnation and by a solid-state reaction between zinc dust and HZSM-5 show no difference in activity or selectivity for ethane dehydrogenation. Thus, one can conclude that independently of the method of preparation the nature of the active sites for the C−H activation in the zinc modified ZSM-5 zeolites is the same.2
Adsorption of light alkanes to Zn/ZSM-5 results in a very strong red-shift of one C−H stretching band as well as in increase of its relative intensity. It was concluded that stabilization of bivalent Zn2+ cations at [AlO2]- framework unit is possible with distant placing of the second charge-compensating aluminum ion. Coordination of an alkane molecule to the thus-stabilized extra-framework cation results in a very strong selective polarization of the interacting C−H bonds. This along with the high Lewis acidity of the exchanged cation results in the observed unusual DRIFT spectra. The strong molecular C2H6 adsorption has been shown to be a precursor to the subsequent dissociative adsorption of ethane. It has been proposed also that adsorption of ethane on zinc ions stabilized in the conventional ion-exchange sites results in similar perturbations and hence in similar vibrational properties of the adsorbed molecules to those observed in the case of low-silica zeolites modified with zinc.
In contrast, our calculations show that molecular C2H6 adsorption on Zn2+ ions stabilized in either charge-alternating (Zd) or conventional ion-exchange sites (Zs) results in very similar IR spectra, containing a very intense and low-frequency IR band. The frequency of the corresponding vibration is only by ∼20 cm-1 lower for the ZnZd site, while the overall IR spectrum is very different from that observed in the ZnY zeolite.45 Therefore, the strength of perturbations of the molecules adsorbed on zeolitic cations mainly depends on the geometry of the cation site rather than on the relative location of the anionic sites in zeolite. The shape and geometry of cation site influence the ligand field stabilizing the exchanged cation. This, in turn, would affect strength of donor−acceptor interactions between the adsorbate and the exchanged cation. Moreover, it was recently shown46 that depending on the shape of the cation site and the size of the exchanged cation the effective electrostatic field of the cation can be significantly varied. This would result in different polarization and redistribution of charges within the adsorbed molecule.
According to the experimental results,31 adsorption of ethane on Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite at relative high equilibrium pressure results in the appearance of an intense and low-frequency IR band with the maximum at 2740 cm-1. Decrease of the equilibrium pressure above the sample leads to further red-shift of this band (down to 2727 cm-1). On the other hand, the opposite trend has been observed upon the C2H6 dissociative adsorption. The position of this band shifts to higher frequencies. Thus, the experimental data clearly show an inhomogeneity of C2H6 species adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 which differ in both adsorption energies and chemical activity and at the same time being characterized by very similar IR spectra.
This coheres very well with the calculated results presented here. Indeed, it was shown in sections 3.1 and 3.2 that heterolytic dissociation of ethane over zinc ions stabilized in the cation site with distant anionic [AlO2]- framework units is a more favorable process than the respective reaction over Zn2+ at the conventional ion-exchanged site. At the same time molecular C2H6 adsorption is significantly stronger on the ZnZd sites and is predominant at lower pressures, explaining the experimentally observed red-shift of the low-frequency band upon the decrease of the equilibrium pressure above the zeolite. Dissociative ethane adsorption takes place at the same ZnZd sites resulting in occupation of the respective adsorption sites as well as in a shift of the IR band concerned toward higher frequencies.
At the next step, the thus-formed zinc−ethyl species and an acidic proton of zeolite decompose resulting in the one-step elimination of molecular ethylene and dihydrogen. This process proceeds via recombination of an H atom from β-methyl group of [Zn−C2H5]+ ion and H+ ion attached to framework oxygen. On the other hand, desorption of ethylene was observed experimentally simultaneously with formation of zinc−hydride ion.31 It was concluded that the catalytic cycle is closed by consecutive desorption of C2H4 and H2. However, both present calculations and recent experimental results32-34 show that H2 dissociative adsorption on Zn/ZSM-5 is a very easy process. Independent of the cation site, the corresponding activation energies are in the range of 25−75 kJ/mol. Most likely, one-step decomposition of the products of dissociative ethane adsorption can be accompanied with H2 dissociation, which explains why formation of zinc−hydride ions has been observed experimentally.
Although there is no experimental evidence of the presence of dimeric [ZnOZn]2+ ions in Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite, these species have been considered as active sites responsible for light alkane dehydrogenation.15 However, the present study shows that in spite of their high activity for the initial C−H activation, the subsequent chemical transformations over these sites are unfavored as compared to the isolated Zn2+ sites. Therefore, we conclude that the binuclear [ZnOZn]2+ ions cannot be considered as the active sites responsible for dehydrogenation of light alkanes over Zn/ZSM-5. Moreover, recent computational studies 49 reported very low stability of these dimeric species independent of the zeolitic cation site.
To the best of our knowledge, no experimental data are available on the C2H6 adsorption energies or activation energies for light alkane dehydrogenation over well-defined zinc-exchanged zeolites. Therefore, to support the calculations presented, one should use indirect parameters such as vibrational properties of the intermediates involved in the dehydrogenation reaction for comparison of the experimental and theoretical results. Table 8 lists the calculated frequencies of the Zn−H stretching vibrations for the intermediates IV discussed above. The corresponding band at 1934 cm-1 has been experimentally observed after H2 dissociation34-35 and as one of the products of the C2H6 transformations31 over Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite independent of its Si/Al ratio and the method of the preparation of the catalyst. One can see that among the active sites considered, only frequency of the stretching vibration of the Zn−H moiety formed at the ZnZd site (IVZnZd and IV‘ZnZd) cohere well with the experimental value, whereas the stretches of zinc hydrides formed at the other sites show significantly lower frequencies.

Summarizing the foregoing discussions, we can conclude that isolated bivalent zinc cations stabilized at the zeolitic cation sites with distant charge-compensating alumum-oxygen occupied tetrahedrons are the most probable active species for the alkane dehydrogenation. The calculated apparent activation energy for this reaction equals to 153 kJ/mol. One should realize that the method and the model used do not take into account the electrostatic field due to the zeolite cavity. This can additionally stabilize polar transition states and slightly lower the calculated activation energy. 50 Nevertheless, even in spite of neglecting this factor, the presented value well matches the typical values of the apparent activation energy for the dehydrogenation reactions over cationic zeolites. 51
5. Conclusions
The reaction mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation was investigated using DFT calculations for different possible cationic zinc sites in Zn/ZSM-5. The catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic C−H bond cleavage of the C2H6 molecule strongly adsorbed on Zn2+ ion at zeolitic cation sites with distantly located [AlO2]- framework units. Due to the indirect charge-compensation, the Lewis acidity of the corresponding cations is significantly increased, resulting in enhanced chemical reactivity. Initial proton abstraction is preferred on the O-sites neighboring the ring where the cation is located rather than on the oxygen atoms of the same zeolitic ring. The resulting product decomposes via one-step elimination of H2 and C2H4. The activation energy for this reaction is strongly dependent on the relative position of [Zn−C2H5]+ and H+ species. Therefore, the presence of acidic protons in the catalyst can promote the regeneration of the active sites. Subsequent desorption of ethylene from the thus-formed molecular complex of C2H4 with Zn2+ ion regenerates the initial active site (ZnZd). The calculated overall activation barrier for the C2H6 dehydrogenation over ZnZd is equal to 153 kJ/mol.
Bivalent zinc ions stabilized in the conventional ion-exchange sites (ZnZs) are less likely active sites. The low-energy path for the catalytic reaction over these sites consists of the same elementary steps as in the ZnZd case. Due to significantly lower Lewis acidity, the initial heterolytic dissociation of ethane is less favorable. Moreover, subsequent steps of the catalytic cycle exhibit higher activation barriers and reaction energies. The reactivity of the isolated Zn2+ sites is strongly dependent on the Al distribution in zeolite. However, this factor influences the vibrational properties of the adsorbed C2H6 species only slightly. We conclude that the observed very strong perturbations of the adsorbed molecules are mainly due to the geometry of the cationic sites of ZSM-5 zeolite.
Although binuclear ZnOZn sites show the highest initial activity, heterolytic C2H6 dissociation results in formation of very stable species. Both these effects are strongly interrelated and result from the high Lewis basicity of the extra-lattice oxygen and strong steric strain of the active site. Ethene elimination from [Zn−C2H5···HO−Zn]2+ intermediate faces a high activation barrier of 190 kJ/mol. It is also strongly thermodynamically unfavored. In contrast to the isolated Zn2+ sites, in this case β-H abstraction resulting in formation of zinc−hydride species is preferred over the one-step elimination of C2H4 and H2.
