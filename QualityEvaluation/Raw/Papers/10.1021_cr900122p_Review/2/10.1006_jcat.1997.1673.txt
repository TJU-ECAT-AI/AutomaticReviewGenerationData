γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (0–6.3 wt% V
atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane. The vana-
dium loading strongly inﬂuences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3-
supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane
and ethane. While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in-
creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond-
ing oleﬁns shows a maximum for catalysts with 3–4 wt% V atoms.
In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during
the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during
the ODH of ethane. Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by
51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6
octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading.
In this way, although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show
higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation
reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+
species were observed. The number and nature of the acid sites also
change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob-
served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and
Brønsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading.
Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples,
V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentra-
tion depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests.

INTRODUCTION
Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxides are well
known for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, but their
catalytic properties depend on the metal oxide support and
on the vanadium content (1–5). On Al2O3-supported vana-
dia catalysts, oleﬁns and aromatic hydrocarbons are selec-
tively transformed into oxygenated products on catalysts
with vanadium content higher than the theoretical mono-
layer; however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alka-
nes, the best selectivities to the corresponding oleﬁns are

achieved only on catalysts with low vanadium loading (6–9).
Furthermore, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation prod-
ucts depends on the alkane fed and decreases in the order
ethane > propane > n-butane (9–11).
Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char-
acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods. The
data obtained from Raman (12–16), 51V NMR (15–17),
ESR (18–20), XPS (14, 21), UV–Vis reﬂectance (19),
EXAFS–XANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re-
duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric
studies of adsorbed probe molecules (25–27) indicate that
the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con-
tent. If a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering
thesurfaceofthesupportshouldneed4.98 × 1014molecules
V2O5 cm−2, the appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3
occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoret-
ical monolayer (14). At lower vanadium loadings, isolated
and/or associated tetrahedral and/or octahedral V5+ species
have been observed.
This paper reports the inﬂuence of the vanadium load-
ing of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, under
submonolayer coverages, on their catalytic properties for
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane us-
ing low alkane/oxygen ratios. The catalyst characterization
was performed with the aim of elucidating the nature of
the active and the selective sites for the oxydehydrogena-
tion reactions.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation
A series of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were
prepared by “wet” impregnation of a Girdler T126 γ -
Al2O3 support (SBET = 188 m2 g−1), ground and sieved to
0.042–0.059 cm, with an ammonium metavanadate solution
(pH = 7). The concentrations of the solutions were selected
to achieve vanadium loadings ranging between 0 and 8 wt%
vanadium atoms. In addition, two catalysts were prepared
by percolating a 0.05 M ammonium metavanadate solution
through γ -Al2O3 support (400 ml of solution for 5 g of the

The catalysts were ﬁnally calcined at 600◦C during 6 h.
The characteristics of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. The
vanadium coverages indicated in Table 1 were calculated
considering that 4.98 × 1018 molecules V2O5 m−2 is the
vanadium loading necessary to obtain a monolayer of
vanadium oxide completely covering the surface of the
support (14).
Catalytic Test
The catalytic tests for the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of ethane were carried out in a ﬁxed-bed quartz
tubular reactor (16-mm i.d., 500-mm length) equipped with
a coaxial thermocouple for temperatures proﬁles. Cata-
lyst samples 0.3 to 1.3 g and particle sizes between 0.25
and 0.42 mm were mixed with variable amounts of SiC
(0.59 mm particle size) to keep a constant volume in the
catalyst bed (3 cm3). The reaction was studied in the temper-
ature interval 450–600◦C using an ethane/oxygen/helium
molar ratio of 4/8/88. The total ﬂow was varied from 100 to
200 ml min−1 obtaining different contact times [W/F = 15
to 80 gcat h (mol-C2)−1]. Analysis of reactants and products
was carried out by gas chromatography, using two column
types:(i)PorapakQ(3.0m × 1/8in.);(ii)molecularsieve5A
(1.5 × 1/8 in.). Analysis of C4 hydrocarbons was carried out
by gas chromatography, using a 23% SP-1700 Chromosorb
PAW (30 × 1/8 in.) column (11).
Blank runs in the temperature interval 450–600◦C were
carried out substituting the catalyst by SiC, at the lowest to-
tal ﬂow used in the present study (100 ml min−1). Under our
reaction conditions the presence of homogeneous reaction
can be neglected.
Catalyst Characterization
The BET surface area of the samples, SBET, was obtained
in an ASAP 2000 apparatus, following the BET method
from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K and taking a value of
0.164 nm2 for the cross section of N2.
Diffuse reﬂectance (DR) spectra in the UV–visible re-
gion were collected with a Shimazdu UV-2010 PC spec-
trophotometer equipped with a reﬂectance attachment.
Solid-state 51V NMR spectra were measured at ambient
temperature on a Varian VXR-400S WB spectrometer at
105. 1 MHz, using a high-speed MAS Doty probe with zirco-
nia rotors (5 mm in diameter). The spectra were recorded
with pulses of 1 µs corresponding to a ﬂip angle of π/18
rad, to avoid signal distortions of the I = 7/2 nuclei. The
51V chemical shifts are referred against liquid VOCl3, using
Mg3(VO4)2, whose chemical shift is −554 ppm, as secondary
reference.
The ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature
on a Varian E-109 spectrometer working at 9.3 GHz (X-
band) with 100-kHz ﬁeld modulation. DPPH (g = 2.0036)
was used as standard to measure the g values.
Infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine were obtained
with a Nicolet 710 FTIR spectrophotometer. Wafers of

CaF2 windows. The samples were degassed at 400◦C for 2 h
and cooled at room temperature (RT) to obtain the origi-
nal IR spectra. Then, pyridine was admitted at room tem-
perature and degassed for 1 h to remove the physisorbed
fraction, and the spectra were taken at room temperature.
Finally, pyridine was desorbed at 150 and 250◦C.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results were
obtained with a Micromeritics apparatus. Samples of
100 mg were ﬁrst treated in argon at room temperature

H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar ratio of 0.15 and total ﬂow of
50 ml min−1) and heated, at a rate of 10◦C min−1, to a ﬁnal
temperature of 1000◦C.
RESULTS
Catalytic Results
Variation of the ethane conversion with the reaction tem-
perature on Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts is
shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that ethane conversion in-
creases with reaction temperature and vanadium loading.
In fact, the rate of ethane conversion per gram of vanadium
increases with vanadium loading (Fig. 2).

Table 2 summarizes the catalytic properties of Al2O3-
supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane at 570◦C. In all cases, ethene
and carbon oxides (CO and CO2) were the only reaction
products obtained. Although ethane conversion increases
with catalyst vanadium content, the highest yield of ethane
was obtained on catalysts with 3 to 5 wt% V atoms. Thus,
the incorporation of vanadium initially increases the yield
to ethene, obtaining catalysts with high selectivity to this
product; however, although the activity of ethane conver-
sion increases, the selectivity to ethene decreases with vana-
dium loadings beyond 4 wt%.
The variation of the selectivities to the main reaction
products with vanadium loading at 570◦C and an ethane
conversion of 20% is shown in Fig. 3. The selectivity to

FIG. 4.
Variation of the yields of ethene, CO, and CO2 with ethane
conversion on catalyst B4 at different reaction temperatures.
ethene shows a maximum on catalysts with a vanadium con-
tent of 3–5 wt%, whereas selectivity to CO2 decreases and
selectivity to CO increases with vanadium content. Thus,
the incorporation of vanadium increases the formation of
ethene, but, at high vanadium loadings, the consecutive re-
actions also increase.
Figure 4 shows the variation of the yields of the main
reaction products with ethane conversion on sample B4 at
different temperatures. At all reaction temperatures stud-
ied, the yield of ethene initially increases with ethane con-
version (Fig. 4a), reaching a maximum for conversions of
30–40%. In addition, it can also be seen that the yield of
ethene (and the selectivity to ethene) increases with reac-
tion temperature.
On the other hand, and according to the results shown
in Fig. 4, it can be concluded that ethene is a primary and
unstable product, whereas CO and CO2 can be considered
primary and secondary products.

during the ODH of n-butane. Strong differences between
the catalysts are observed. In addition, it can be observed
that the yield of butenes obtained on B5 catalysts is lower
than on pure alumina. Since B4 and B5 catalysts present
similar catalytic behavior during the ODH of ethane, it can
be concluded that the V loading of alumina-supported cata-
lysts inﬂuences more strongly their catalytic properties dur-
ing the ODH of n-butane. We may note that, independently
of vanadium loading, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation
products achieved during the ODH of n-butane was lower
than during the ODH of ethane.
Catalyst Characterization
Figure 5 shows the UV–Vis spectra of calcined (Fig. 5a)
and tested samples (Fig. 5b). The absorption band at 280–
290 nm indicates the presence of tetrahedral V5+ species
(8, 9, 19). In addition to this, bands at 350–400 nm (on
calcined samples with high vanadium loading) and 550–
1400 nm (on tested samples) are also observed. The ﬁrst
ones are related to octahedral V5+ species, and the second
ones to V4+ species (8, 9, 19).
Figure 6 shows the 51V wide-line (wl) and magic-angle-
spinning (MAS) spectra of samples B4 and A6. The valley
between the peaks in the nonspinning spectra is produced
by the preacquisition delay of the spectrometer. The spec-
tra recorded under MAS are characterized by intense spin-
ning sideband patterns. The use of different spinning rates
allowed us to determine the main line position.
51V NMR has been shown to be a powerful technique in
the characterization of the V5+ environment in supported
vanadium oxide catalysts (15–17). Comparison of the NMR

spectra of the catalysts with reference compounds provides
information about the coordination symmetry and, for
tetrahedral coordination, the number of bridging V–O–V
oxygen atoms (n in the Q(n) notation) (15).
The wide-line spectrum of sample B4 (Fig. 6a) exhibits
three features at ca. −300, −544, and −900 ppm, and the
center band in the MAS spectrum appears at δ = −580 ppm.
In agreement with previous publications the wide-line spec-
trum can be interpreted as the contribution of two differ-
ent signals (11, 15–17, 24). The low-ﬁeld peak in the static
spectra of Fig. 6 indicates the presence of vanadium in oc-
tahedral coordination; however, due to distortion of the
spectrum we cannot establish the symmetry of this octahe-

dral site. The second signal, characterized by a maximum
between −500 and −600 ppm (at ca. −544 ppm), dominates
the wide-line spectrum and appears at ca. −580 ppm under
spinning. Comparison with model compounds allowed us
to attribute this signal to the presence of polymeric tetra-
hedral V5+ as in metavanadates (15–17). We must indicate
that we were not able to identify the peak corresponding to
the octahedral V5+ species in the MAS spectrum, probably
because of the presence of numerous spinning side bands
of the predominant signal of tetrahedral V5+ species.
Different 51V NMR spectra are obtained for sample A6
(Fig. 6b). The wide-line spectrum of this sample is charac-
teristic of an almost axially symmetric chemical shift tensor

with an intense peak at −370 ppm and a second compo-
nent at around −900 ppm. The MAS center band appears
at −500 ppm (Fig. 6b). The spectroscopic parameters of
this signal as well as the spinning side band pattern are very
similar to those of “type a” signal reported by Eckert and
Wachs (15) for V5+ in distorted octahedral geometry, as in
ZnV2O6 or PbV2O6, and different from those of V2O5.
Thus, the 51V NMR results indicate that crystalline V2O5
has not been formed even in sample A6 with the highest V
coverage studied here. In this sample, V5+ is mostly in a dis-
torted octahedral environment, whereas in sample B4, with
lower V coverage, mainly polymeric tetrahedral species are
present. This is in good agreement with previous publica-
tions (15–17, 24) showing that polymeric tetrahedral vana-
dium is favored at low coverages, while the concentration
of octahedral V5+ species increases with surface vanadium
concentration.
Figure 7 shows the ESR spectrum of sample B5 after the
catalytic test in the ODH of ethane. A similar spectrum was
observed before the catalytic test, although with a lower in-
tensity. This spectrum can be assigned to V4+ (3d1) in an
axially symmetric environment. The hyperﬁne structure is
due to the interaction of the unpaired electron with the nu-
clear magnetic moment of vanadium with I = 7/2 (natural
abundance 99.76%), giving rise to eight parallel and eight
perpendicular components. The resolution of the hyperﬁne
structure in the spectra indicates the presence of highly dis-
persed V4+ ions. The g values and the hyperﬁne coupling
constants of the V4+ signal are g∥= 1.947 (±0.005) g⊥=

1.965 (±0.005), A∥= 190 (±3 G), and A⊥= 78 G (±3 G).
Similar spectra, without any additional signal, were also
recorded at 77 K.
Well-resolved signals with different ESR parameters
have been previously obtained for Al2O3-supported vana-
dium oxide catalysts, which in some cases have been re-
ported to depend on the vanadium content and reduction
pretreatment (8, 18–20). Eon et al. (8) recorded the ESR
spectra of some VOx/Al2O3 catalysts after the ODH of
propane and obtained a signal with spectral parameters
(g⊥= 1.982, g∥= 1.919, A⊥= 70 G, and A∥= 190 G) differ-
ent from those obtained in the present work, which was
attributed to an amorphous surface vanadium oxide phase.
In most of these publications (8, 18–20) the ESR signals
are assigned to (V=
=O)2+ in a tetragonally distorted oc-
tahedral environment with C4v symmetry. The degree of
the tetragonal distortion, and thus the strengh of the V=
=O
bond, is estimated by the parameter B = 1g∥/1g⊥(1g∥=
g∥−ge, 1g⊥= g⊥−ge) that, in the limit of undistorted oc-
tahedral symmetry, takes a value of 1. In our case, B = 1.5,
which is within the range 1.1–4.5 reported by other authors
(20) and is relatively low, suggesting that we are dealing
with (V· · ·O) species rather than with V=
=O. The assign-
ment of the ESR signals to octahedral V4+ is usually sup-
ported on the detection of the signal at room temperature,
since, in general, it is admitted that tetrahedral V4+ is ob-
servable only at low temperature due to relaxation effects.
In a recent publication on the characterization of alumina-
supported vanadium catalysts (18), however, a signal

detectable at 293 K and characterized by g⊥= 1.979–1.985,
g∥= 1.931–1.934 (depending on the sample), A⊥= 74 G,
A∥= 200 G has been assigned to V4+ in a distorted tetra-
hedral environment. Thus, we can conclude that the ESR
spectra shown in Fig. 7 can be tentatively attributed to V4+
in an octahedral coordination, although a more detailed
study would be required to better establish the coordina-
tion environment of the V4+ in these catalysts.
Similar spectra with a different intensity were obtained
for all the catalysts studied here. Table 1 shows the rel-
ative concentrations of V4+ species in the calcined cata-
lysts, determined from the intensity of the ESR spectra.
For catalysts of series A, the intensity of the V4+ ESR sig-
nal slightly increases with vanadium loading. Comparison
of these samples with B4 and B5 catalysts, prepared by a dif-
ferent method, shows the presence of a relatively high con-
centration of V4+ atoms in sample B5 (prepared at pH = 3).
This result suggests that the catalyst preparation procedure
inﬂuences the oxidation state of the incorporated V atoms
in the calcined catalysts.
Ontheotherhand,wealsomonitoredbyESRtherelative
concentration of V4+ species on catalyst B4 with the ethane
conversion level achieved (Fig. 8). It can be seen that the
relative amount of V4+ species increases with ethane con-
version. Similar behavior is observed for all the catalysts
studied here, although the ESR spectrum of sample A6 af-
ter reaction shows, superimposed to the hyperﬁne structure,
a broad and unstructured line produced by the dipolar in-
teractions, indicating the presence of associated V4+. This
can be due to the higher degree of reduction of this sam-
ple provoked by its higher activity in the ODH reaction of
ethane.
Pyridine adsorption was followed by infrared spec-
troscopy to identify the number and nature of acid
sites in alumina-supported catalysts. Figure 9 shows the
FTIR spectra of the catalysts after pyridine adsorption

than 4 wt% (Fig. 9a). For these latter samples, a vibration
band at 1638 cm−1, which can also be related to Brønsted
acid sites, is observed (25). Additional bands at 1492 and
1615 cm−1, associated with the presence of pyridine, were
also observed in all the catalysts. However, their assign-
ment to speciﬁc type of acid sites is not clear. Comparison
of the spectra in Fig. 9a indicates that the higher the catalyst
vanadium content, the lower the number of Lewis acid sites
(Table 1).
After evacuation at high temperatures only Lewis acid
sites are observed (Fig. 9b). Under these conditions, the in-
tensity of the characteristic band at 1450 cm−1 decreases for
all the samples presenting similar intensities for the support
and the catalysts. Thus, for the alumina-supported vanadia
catalysts studied here, the total number of Lewis acid sites
decreases, while the number of Brønsted acid sites increases
with vanadium loading. According to this, and in agreement
with previous results (25), it can be concluded that Lewis
acid sites are due to γ -Al2O3, whereas Brønsted acid sites
are related to vanadium oxide incorporation.
Infrared spectra in the hydroxyl region of the support,
evacuated at 400◦C, show two absorption bands of free
hydroxyl groups at 3750 and 3680 cm−1. These bands are
present only on pure alumina and catalysts with low vana-
dium loading, indicating that the free hydroxyl groups

TPR patterns of the studied catalysts are shown in Fig. 10.
Three peaks can be observed: an intense peak at 463–505◦C
with a shoulder at 450◦C and a broad peak at tempera-
tures above 600◦C. The TPR results summarized in Table 1
indicate that the temperature of maximum hydrogen con-
sumption decreases and the amount of hydrogen consump-
tion increases with vanadium loading. On the other hand,
and considering a total V5+-to-V3+ reduction, the average
oxidation state (AOS) after H2 reduction has been calcu-
lated and included in Table 1. It can be seen that, except in
the case of sample B4 (with an AOS of 3.8), the catalysts
present AOSs of 3.1–3.3.
These results are in agreement with those observed by
other authors (14, 23, 24), although the temperature of
maximum hydrogen consumption changes depending on
the experimental conditions used. The amounts of H2 con-
sumption for the catalysts studied are higher than those ob-
served by Koranne et al. (24) but similar to those reported
by Haber et al. (23). The discrepancies between these two
papers could be due to different amount of H2 adsorbed,
remaining on the catalyst surface as V–O–H (24). If we
consider this H2 adsorption, the real AOS of the catalyst
tested will be near 4+, and the difference between the real
and estimated AOSs will be related to the amount of H2
adsorbed.
DISCUSSION
According to the results shown in Fig. 4, it can be con-
cluded that ethene is a primary and unstable product,
whereas CO and CO2 are primary and secondary prod-
ucts. Thus, a network for the ODH of ethane is proposed
in Scheme 1 in which CO and CO2 are formed by the deep
oxidation of both ethane and ethene.
On the other hand, from the catalytic and characteriza-
tion results, three types of active sites can be proposed on
VOx/Al2O3 catalysts: (i) Vanadium-free alumina sites, the
number of which decreases with increasing vanadium load-
ing, are active but nonselective in the ODH of ethane. (ii)
PolymerictetrahedralV5+species,whichareformedmainly
on catalysts with vanadium loading lower than 5 wt%, are
active and selective in the formation of ethene. (iii) Poly-
meric VO6 octahedra, observed mainly on catalysts with
vanadium loading higher than 5 wt%, are active in the ox-
idation of ethane to ethene but also in the consecutive re-
action of ethene to carbon oxides.
The highest selectivity to ethene in the ODH of ethane is
obtainedoncatalystsinwhichtetrahedralvanadiumspecies
are predominant; however, although this also occurs for the
ODH of n-butane, the selectivity to oleﬁns was lower than
in the oxidation of ethane. In previous works, it has been
proposed that the selectivity to C4-oleﬁns can be related
to the acid–base character of the catalyst, in the sense that
the higher the acid character the lower the selectivity to
C4-oleﬁns (9–11).
IR results of pyridine adsorption/desorption indicate that
the catalysts present Lewis acid sites at low vanadium con-
tent and both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites at high vana-
dium loading, the latter showing the higher acid strength.
Thus, Brønsted acid sites are related mainly to octahedral
V5+ species; however, Lewis acid sites correspond mainly to
the support and their number decreases when the V load-
ing increases. In addition, since the octahedral vanadium
species present generally low selectivity, the fact that these
species show a higher acid character can contribute to the
extremely low selectivity of these catalysts during the ODH
of n-butane.
The importance of the acid character of both support and
catalysts was also proposed to explain the catalytic proper-
ties of supported vanadium catalysts during the oxidation
of methanol and heptanol (27). It was observed that the
acid character of alumina inﬂuences the catalytic proper-
ties of vanadium-containing catalysts. Thus, alumina shows
high selectivities to dimethyl ether or n-heptene during the

alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts.
OXIDATIVE DEHYDROGENATION OF ETHANE AND BUTANE

oxidation of methanol or n-heptanol, respectively, and
these selectivities increase with decreasing vanadium
loading.
It is known that oleﬁns are adsorbed on pure alu-
mina at 300◦C, forming alkenylcarbonium ions, to a de-
gree that depends on the oleﬁn, decreasing in the order
1-butene > propene > ethene (29). The lower selectivity
to oleﬁns in the oxidation of n-butane when compared
with ethane can be attributed to the higher adsorption of
n-butenes on the alumina support favoring a deep oxida-
tion. Then, the contribution of the support to the catalytic
properties of supported vanadium oxide catalysts must be
considered.
On the other hand, although mainly V5+ species are ob-
served on calcined samples, the number of V4+ species
on the tested catalysts increased with the ethane conver-
sion level (Fig. 8). The appearance of V4+ species has also
been observed after the ODH of propane on alumina-
supported vanadium oxide catalysts (8). However, the role
of V4+ species is not clear. According to Ishida et al.
(30), the reduction of Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide
catalysts produces new Lewis acid sites associated with
the reduced vanadium species formed. In our samples, an
opposite trend between selectivity to ethene and the re-
duction degree of V species with the conversion of ethane
is observed (Fig. 8). At high ethane conversion, the vana-
dium is partially reduced and can also favor a deep ox-
idation of both ethane and ethene decreasing the selec-
tivity to ethene. The negative role of the presence of V4+
species could also contribute to the lower selectivities to
oleﬁns obtained during the ODH of n-butane, since in
this case a higher degree of catalyst reduction can be
expected.
The effect of V4+ on oleﬁn selectivity proposed here
seems to be inconsistent with previous publications on the
oxidation of n-butane or o-xylene on V–P–O and VOx/TiO2
catalysts, respectively (31). For these systems, an effective
V4+/V5+ ratio near 1 is required to obtain the maximum
selectivities to partially oxygenated products. Opposite to
the ODH reactions, however, a negative effect of the pres-
ence of acid sites on the selectivity to partial oxygenated
products is not observed, and thus, V4+ species can play a
different role in O-insertion reactions than in the ODH of
alkanes.
The results presented in this paper allows us to conclude
that although both octahedral and tetrahedral V5+ species
are active and selective in the ODH of ethane, the former
show higher activity but lower selectivity, especially during
the ODH of n-butane, due to the higher rate of consecutive
reactions. This effect could be attributed to the higher acid-
ity and reducibility of the VO6 octahedra as can be deduced
from the catalyst characterization results. In addition, the
contribution of the vanadium-free support must be consid-
ered, especially during the ODH of n-butane.
