A DFT study of C–C bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium monohydrides (ºSi–O)3ZrH and dihydrides
(ºSi–O)2ZrH2 shows that only the latter are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions.
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides1–5 draw recently much atten-
tion due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin poly-
merization,1–2 C–C bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyole-
fins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in
alkanes.5–6 Basset et al.3–6 considered the catalytic sites of alkane
hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (ºSi–O)3ZrH.
On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zir-
conium dihydrides (ºSi–O)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this
system. Earlier, we have performed DFT studies of the mech-
anisms of H/D isotope exchange in methane7 and ethylene poly-
merization8 catalysed by the Yermakov–Basset system. The cata-
lytic activity of both types of supported zirconium hydrides was
estimated to be quite proximal in respect to the polymerization
of ethylene.8 Zirconium dihydrides, however, were found to be
much more active in the isotope exchange reaction.7 Moreover,
we calculated the activation parameters of H/D exchange for
zirconium dihydrides, which are in a much better agreement
with experimental data9 than those for monohydrides.
As a continuation of these studies, we consider the probable
mechanisms of C–C bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on model
species 1 and 2 (Schemes 1, 2) using butane as a model linear
alkane. All the DFT calculations were performed under the
same approach as previously7,8 using the original PRIRODA
program.10 The replacement of the skeletal O–Si fragments by
fluorine atoms when performing quantum-chemical calculations
of the structure of silica-supported compounds was proposed
and substantiated earlier.11 The generalised gradient approxima-
tion (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional by Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof12 was employed. The 40 core electrons of
Zr, 10 for Si and 2 for C, O and F were described by effective
core potentials.13–15 The orbital basis sets of contracted
Gaussian-type functions of size (5s1p)/[3s1p] for H, (5s5p2d)/
[3s3p2d] for C, O, F and Si, and (9s9p8d)/[5s5p4d] for Zr were
used for the remaining electrons in conjunction with the den-
sity-fitting basis sets of uncontracted Gaussian-type functions of
size (5s1p) for H, (6s3p3d1f) for C, O, F and Si, and
(10s6p6d5f5g) for Zr. Full geometry optimization of all struc-
tures studied in this work was performed using analytical
gradients followed by analytical calculations of the second
derivatives of energy with respect to coordinates in order to
characterise the nature of the resulting stationary points (mini-
ma or saddle points) on the potential energy surface (PES).
Zero-point vibrational energies and thermodynamic data were
calculated in the harmonic approximation.
The catalytic cycle for the C2–C3 bond hydrogenolysis in
butane on supported zirconium monohydrides 1, which is con-
sistent with that proposed by Basset et al.,3–6 is presented in
Scheme 1. The energy profile is shown in Figure 1. The first
stage of the hydrogenolysis, the transformation of the initial
hydride into n-butyl derivative 4 with the elimination of a hydro-
gen molecule, proceeds by the s-bond metathesis pathway via
four-centered transition state 3 (∆E¹ = 7.9 kcal mol–1, ∆G298

thermic (∆E = 5.3 kcal mol–1, ∆G298 = 4.0 kcal mol–1). It is fol-

lowed by C2–C3 bond cleavage and the migration of a β-ethyl
fragment to zirconium, which leads to the formation of zirconium
alkyl-ethylene complex 6 via transition state 5. The energy bar-
rier for this transformation is rather high (∆E¹ = 31.4 kcal mol–1,
∆G298
¹ = 30.9 kcal mol–1) and the process is extremely ther-
modynamically unfavourable (∆E = 20.6 kcal mol–1, ∆G298 =
= 17.2 kcal mol–1). The equilibrium constant for the transfor-
mation 4 ® 6 under the real experimental conditions (T = 150 °C)
was calculated to be 1.3×10–9. The coordination sphere of the
metal in 6 is saturated. Thus, it cannot coordinate an extra hydro-
gen molecule. Hence, the only way of its further transformations
is the elimination of ethylene, as it is supposed by the Basset
scheme. The corresponding transformation (6 ® 7) leads to a
further increase of the system energy (∆E = 5.4 kcal mol–1), which
is in part compensated by a considerable entropy gain (∆G298 =
= –7.0 kcal mol–1). The last stage, allowing to repeat the catalytic
cycle, is the hydrogenolysis of ethyl derivative 7 by the σ-bond
metathesis pathway via transition state 8 (∆E¹ = 13.2 kcal mol–1,
∆G298
¹
= 24.7 kcal mol–1 relative to 7). Effectively, the hydro-
genolysis of butane using the Basset catalytic cycle describes
the cleavage of butane into ethane and ethylene (C4H10 ®
® C2H6 + C2H4). The calculated ∆H298 and ∆G298 values for
this reaction are 22.7 and 11.0 kcal mol–1, respectively, which
are in a good agreement with the tabulated ∆H0 and ∆F0 values
of 22.4 and 12.5 kcal mol–1, calculated from the standard forma-
tion energies.16 The data suggest that the hydrogenolysis of butane
cannot proceed under mild conditions on supported zirconium
monohydrides 1 by the Basset mechanism. The process is un-
favourable from both kinetic and thermodynamic points of view.
The thermodynamic restriction of the alkane hydrogenolysis
could be overcome if the considerable energy loss for the C–C
bond cleavage is compensated by the formation of two ethane
molecules (in case of butane) in the catalytic cycle. The overall
process described by this equation (C4H10 + H2 ® 2C2H6) is
thermodynamically favourable [∆H298 = –11.8 kcal mol–1, ∆G298 =
= –14.8 kcal mol–1; ∆H0 = –10.3 kcal mol–1 (ref. 16), ∆F0 =
= –11.6 kcal mol–1 (ref. 16)]. This opportunity comes true if
one considers the active catalytic sites to be zirconium dihy-
drides 2 (Scheme 2).
The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative
10 (∆E = 3.8 kcal mol–1, ∆G298 = 2.2 kcal mol–1) via transition
state 9 (∆E¹ = 12.6 kcal mol–1, ∆G298
¹ = 22.5 kcal mol–1 relative
to free reagents). The equilibrium constant of this process is
7.3×10–2 at 150 °C. The cleavage of the C2–C3 bond in the
n-butyl fragment (10 ® 12) requires the overcoming of the top-
most energy barrier on the reaction path, transition state 11
(∆E¹ = 31.9 kcal mol–1, ∆G298
¹ = 33.0 kcal mol–1 relative to 10,
see Figure 2). The rate constant of this process at 150 °C was
calculated to be 1.7×10–5 s–1, but this stage is exothermic (∆E =
= –8.4 kcal mol–1, ∆G298 = –8.5 kcal mol–1) and thus the process
may proceed under the experimental conditions described in
ref. 3. It is noteworthy that the relaxation of transition state 11
leads directly to diethyl derivative 12 by-passing the stage of the
intermediate η2-coordinated ethylene complex formation. Suc-
cessive hydrogenolysis of 12 via standard pathway (12 ® 13 ®
® 14 ® 15 ® 2) requiring the overcome of two energy barriers
and characterised by an overall energy gain of ∆E = –11.1 kcal mol–1,
∆G298 = –8.5 kcal mol–1. It finishes the overall thermodynami-
cally favourable process and allows the catalytic cycle to restart.
Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides 2, which
existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al.,2 unlike
zirconium monohydrides 1, are capable to catalyse alkane
hydrogenolysis under mild conditions. Basset et al.3 undoubt-
edly proved that monohydrides 1 are mainly formed on the
silica surface under conditions used for catalyst preparation.3
Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides 2 could coexist
with monohydrides 1 on the silica surface. In our opinion, a
more detailed experimental study has to be performed to
determine the structure of real active centres in this catalytic
system.
