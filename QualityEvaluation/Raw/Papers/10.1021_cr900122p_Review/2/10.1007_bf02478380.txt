Abstract 
Iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix (c~-centers) are shown to perform 
single-turnover cycles of methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature 
when nitrous oxide is used as a source of oxygen. The origin of carbon and oxygen 
in the product methanol was traced using ~3C and ~SO isotopes. Probable structure 
of c4-sites as well as mechanistic features of the reaction allow to consider this 
system as a first successful model of methane monooxygenase. 
Keywords: Methane oxidation, methanol, iron complexes, ZSM-5 zeolite,

INTRODUCTION 
Enzyme systems of methanotrophs, methane monooxygenases (MMO), 
selectively catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol at ambient conditions 
by transferring one oxygen atom activated on a diiron center to a C-H bond [1]. 
Taking into account the well-known inertness of methane, which resists all 
traditional approaches to its selective oxidation by man-made catalysts, chemists 
focus their growing attention on tmderstanding the mechanism of MMO catalysis 
to employ it for solving this most challenging problem of modern chemistry [2]. 
Large natural deposits of methane with no efficient technologies for their 
chemical use add to the importance of this problem [3].

Recently, significant progress has been made in the field. The MMO structure 
including detailed geometry of its catalytic binuclear iron center was described 
by means of various spectroscopic techniques [4]; some intermediate species of 
the catalytic cycle were identified, and their likely structure was interpreted [5]; 
the first MMO chemical models were developed [6]. However, all attempts to 
mimic MMO functional activity and to demonstrate the selective chemical 
oxidation of methane at ambient conditions were unsuccessful. 
In this paper we report that FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that 
form under thermal activation (called a-centers [7]) is able to perform single- 
turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature 
when nitrous oxide (N20) is the source of oxygen. This system may be 
considered as a first successful model of MMO. Some indications on the 
probable diiron composition of c~-centers including their M0ssbauer spectral 
parameters imply a structural similarity between a-centers and active centers of 
MMO. Low reaction temperature, high selectivity and high kinetic isotope effect 
reveal similar mechanistic features of both enzymatic and chemical methane 
oxidation. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
FeZSM-5 zeolite (SiOz/A1203 = 72, iron content 0.56 wt.%) active for methane 
hydroxylation was prepared via a conventional procedure of hydrotherrnal 
synthesis [7]. The zeolite was treated with an ammonia buffer solution and 
calcined in air at 823 K to convert it into the H-form. The sample was activated 
by calcination in vacuum at 1170 K to indrease the concentration of a-centers 
[81. 
Experiments on loading active oxygen on a-centers by N20 decomposition, as 
well as the oxidation of methane with this a-oxygen were carried out in a static 
vacuum setup equipped with an on-line mass-spectrometer. A zeolite sample was 
placed in a microreactor which could be easily isolated from the rest of the setup. 
The microreactor volume (~5 cm 
3) made up an insignificant part of the total 
reaction volume (~600 cm3). Before each experiment, the sample was pretreated 
consecutively in vacuum and in oxygen (0.8 Torr) at 550~ 
N20 of medical 
grade was applied. Other experimental details are described in the following text.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
At temperatures lower than 573 K, N20 decomposition on a-centers 
quantitatively follows reaction (1): 
N2O + ( )c~ = (O)c~ + N2, 
(1) 
loading the active centers with co-oxygen [7]. This causes unusual kinetics when 
N20 consumption is accompanied only by dinitrogen evolution, while no 
dioxygen is detected in the gas phase. The reaction terminates after all c~-centers 
are occupied. The number of a-centers can be determined in several ways 
providing consistent results: by measuring the amount of N2 evolved (or NzO 
consumed); by performing isotope exchange at room temperature 
(160) a "k- 1802 ~--- 
(180) ~ + 160180 
(2) 
and calculating the isotope balance, or by desorbing (O)~ as Oz upon the 
temperature rise above 573 K. The sample under study had N~ = 2.2x1019 
centers/g. 
At temperatures lower than 573 K a-oxygen is thermally stable. That gives a 
nice opportunity to study chemistry of c~-oxygen with respect to its reaction with 
various substrates, including methane. A control experiment showed that an 
"empty" surface of the zeolite was inert to methane: only an insignificant CH4 
adsorption occurred upon contacting with the surface at room temperature. A 
slight temperature increase caused complete methane desorption into the gas 
phase, 
recovering its initial pressure. 
The process is quite different in the presence of c~-oxygen (Fig. 1). in this 
case, methane is irreversibly consumed after opening of the microreactor at room 
temperature due to the reaction with a-oxygen. The product of the reaction is 
strongly bound to the surface and cannot be identified by its desorption into the 
gas phase. As the temperature grows to 520-570 K, the product decomposes and 
the resulting carbon monoxide evolves. 
In order to identify the product, we carried out a series of single-turnover runs 
by an extraction procedure which has been successfully used for studying or- 
oxygen reaction with benzene [9]. We employed the following three-stage 
experimental scheme: 
1. c~-Oxygen loading on FeZSM-5 via the NzO decomposition at 523 K 
(reaction 1); 
2. Methane interaction with a-oxygen at room temperature; 
3. Product extraction followed by the GC and GC/MS analysis.

A mixture of water and acetonitrile was found to be the most suitable 
extractant. In all experiments methanol was detected as the only product and its 
amount coincided within the experimental error with that of methane consumed 
(Table 1). There was no methanol formation if no a-oxygen was loaded onto the 
surface. 
To exclude any accidental source of methanol, we performed two experiments 
using L3C and 'SO isotopes. In the first experiment 13CH4 (79% enriched with 
13C) interacted with 160 a-oxygen. As a result, according to GC/MS analysis, 
77% of methanol formed was found to be labeled with ~3C. In the second 
experiment, (O)~, was exchanged with 1~O2 
(82%) according to reaction (2) prior 
to the reaction with methane. It resulted in the formation of methanol enriched in 
180. This means that methanol tbrmation exactly follows reaction (3):

Zeolite-encapsulated metal complexes were successfully used to mimic 
cytochrome P-450 [10], but according to our knowledge, the system under 
discussion is the first to demonstrate a MMO functional analogue. Its similarity 
to MMO is supported in particular by data on the kinetic isotope effect (KIE = kH 
/ko) for reaction (3) [11]. KIE was measured using the intramolecular 
competition of C-H and C-D bonds of CH2D2 molecules in their reaction with e~- 
oxygen. CFID2OH and CH2DOD were the only reaction products, their ratio 
being measured by ~H-NMR spectroscopy. In the temperature range of 223- 373 
K, KIE varied from 5.5 to 1.9. These high values mean that the rate-determining 
step of methane oxidation by o~-oxygen involves C-H bond cleavage similar to 
the MMO oxidation mechanism with its high KIE value [12]. 
Binuclear iron centers are a particular feature of MMO compared to the 
mononuclear centers of other monooxygenases [1]. There is some indirect 
evidence favoring the binuclear structure of the active iron complexes in the 
ZSM-5 matrix: 
1. M6ssbauer spectral parameters of the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states in FeZSM-5 
complexes (see below) lie in the region typical for the oxo-bridged binuclear iron 
complexes [4]. 
2. According to a quantum-chemical model [13], ~x-centers are binuclear iron 
complexes stabilized in the intracrystalline pore space of the zeolite matrix. 
3. The ratio between the numbers of a-centers and iron atoms (N=:NF~) varies 
considerably, depending on the iron content and the activation procedure of the 
zeolite, but we never succeeded to obtain a ratio greater than 1:2, which appears 
to be the maximum possible one. For the sample under investigation N~ : NF~ = 
1 : 2.6. This implies that 75-80% of iron was in the active state. 
It is worth noticing that active o~-centers can perform not only a single- 
turnover surface reaction, but also a steady-state oxidation catalysis. There are 
~x-centers whose activity gives FeZSM-5 zeolites a unique ability to catalyze 
direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide at 573-623 K, providing 
256

et al.: IRON 
COMPLEXES 
nearly 100 % selectivity [9,14]. Note also that binuclear oxo (or hydroxo) metal 
complexes, whose remarkable chemical potential is still to be understood, seem 
to be widely and successfully used in nature when it is necessary to create highly 
active oxygen species. Thus, enzyme oxygen-evolving complexes assisting in 
water oxidation as well as most of their artificial mimics are also assumed to 
have binuclear metal complexes as functional units [15].

hyperfine parameters presented in Table 2 are characteristics of high-spin Fe(III) 
and Fe(II) states, respectively. The sample was calcined in air at 823 K before 
recording the spectrum 
Results obtained by M6ssbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted in favor 
of the FeZSM-5 similarity to MMO, M6ssbauer technique is one of the most 
efficient tools for studying states of iron. It has been successfully used for the 
MMO investigation [4]. Depending on the conditions, iron atoms in the MMO 
diiron active center exist both in the oxidized and reduced states. Two different 
quadrupole doublets correspond to each of these states. Their main parameters 
are listed in Table 2. In the case of FeZSM-5, the MOssbauer spectrum is also 
represented by V,'o quadrupole doublets corresponding to two iron states in the 
zeolite (Fig. 2). A narrow doublet corresponds to the iron oxidation state of +3, 
PANOV 
et al.: IRON

257 
while a broad doublet corresponds to the Fe 
z+ state. One can see an excellent 
agreement between the spectral characteristics of the iron complexes in both 
reduced and oxidized states in MMO and in ZSM-5 matrix. However, to make a 
final conclusion on the cx-site structure, M0ssbauer measurements should be 
conducted in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which is not available now 
with our instrument.

The presence of a reduced state of iron after high temperature 02 pretreatment 
of FeZSM-5 seems to be a surprise but is a reproducible result. Tendency of iron 
to be reduced to the Fe 
z+ state has also been observed for a Fe-exchanged Y 
zeolite [16]. This phenomenon may result from a particular type of stabilization 
of small iron complexes in a zeolite micropore space. 
More details about the mechanism of the methane hydroxylation by c~-oxygen 
as well as by MMO are required. There are several hypotheses suggested for,the 
hydroxylation of hydrocarbons by MMO [17]. One of them involving the 
intermediate formation of methoxy groups is similar to a recently proposed 
mechanism of cx-oxygen methane oxidation [13]. A direct insertion of an oxygen 
atom into a C-H bond via a five-coordinated carbon [18] seems also an 
interesting idea to be verified in further studies. 
In conclusion, we may summarize that the FeZSM-5 - N20 system may be 
considered as a promising MMO model. A remarkable advantage of this model is 
a possibility to study the MMO-like active oxygen as well as the active state of 
iron under easily controlled and reproducible conditions. It opens new 
opportunities for the progress in this exciting field of science.
