Abstract
This review paper presents the signiﬁcant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid
and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2–C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction
scheme, nature of the active sites. Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2–C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in
mixture with alkenes: isobutane–butene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered.

1. Introduction
The activation of short-chain alkanes is one of the great chal-
lenges of the present catalysis research. Indeed, the direct use
of these cheap and readily available materials will provide an
attractive alternative to the processes that are currently based on
alkenes and aromatics [1,2]. The objective of this paper is to
present the recent advances in the ﬁeld of C2–C4 alkanes non-
oxidative activation and transformation into valuable products
over zeolite catalysts.
C2–C4 alkanes are often associated with methane in natu-
ral gas and are also formed in signiﬁcant amounts in catalytic
cracking (FCC). Ethane and propane can be used as reﬁnery
fuel, propane as liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) alone or in mix-
ture with butane. C2–C4 alkanes can be used as feedstock in
steam cracking for the production of short-chain alkenes and of
benzenic hydrocarbons. Aromatization over Ga/MFI catalysts
constitutes another alternative for the valorization of C3–C4
alkanes [3–7]. Butanes can be used as components of gaso-
line or as feedstock to various reﬁnery processes. n-Butane
can be isomerized into isobutane [7,8]. A large part of isobu-
tane is used in alkylation units for the production of high
octane C8 branched alkanes, another one is dehydrogenated into
isobutene for the production of methyl tertio butyl ether (MTBE)
[8].
Most of these processes involve acid or bifunctional metal
acid catalysts. Zeolite catalysts are already used in aromati-
zation processes [3–7] and could be used in isobutane–butene
alkylation. Moreover, they are able to catalyze n-butane iso-
merization, even if their activity is too low in comparison to
that of chlorinated alumina catalyst which is currently used
[8]. Lastly zeolites are promising components of catalysts for
more environment-friendly processes: oxydehydrogenation of
propane [9–11], one pot bi-step transformations such as the pro-
duction of isobutene by dehydroisomerization of n-butane [12]
or the alkylation of benzene with ethane [13] or with propane
[14].
The acid catalyzed reactions over zeolites will be presented
in Section 2. Pure C2–C4 alkanes can only be transformed at
relatively high temperatures (>150 ◦C). Moreover, the reaction
temperature determines the nature of their transformation:
- Disproportionation (and isomerization in the case of butanes)
above 150 ◦C.
- Dehydrogenation, cracking and aromatization above 300 ◦C.
At temperatures lower than 150 ◦C, no reaction of pure
alkanes can be observed. However, transformations appear
when short-chain alkanes are used in mixture with alkenes
(isobutane–butenes alkylation).
Section 3 deals with bifunctional catalysis transformations.
The association of dehydrogenating species to the acid zeolites
allows easier or/and more selective transformations of short-
chain alkanes: aromatization over Ga/HMFI, isomerization and
dehydroisomerization of n-butane over Pt or Pd/H zeolites, alky-
lation of benzene with ethane or propane over Pt or Ga/HMFI.
2. Transformation of light alkanes over acid zeolites
2.1. Activation mechanisms
2.1.1. The carbenium-chain mechanism
Until 20 years ago, it was widely accepted that the transfor-
mation of hydrocarbons over acid zeolites proceeded through a
chain mechanism where carbenium ions acted as chain carriers
[8]. Carbenium ions may undergo several reactions: deprotona-
tion, hydride transfer, isomerization, -scission (and oligomer-
izationwhichisthereversereaction).Inalkanecracking,hydride
transfer is the propagation step (Fig. 1), reason for which the
cracking mechanism is commonly denominated as bimolecular.
The stability of the carbenium ions increases with their degree
of substitution: tertiary III > secondary II > primary I > methyl
and the higher the stability of the carbenium ions involved in
-scission, the faster the step [15].
More recently, Kazansky and Senchenya [16] proposed that
the real intermediates were not carbenium ions but covalent
alkoxide species (Fig. 2). Contrarily to carbenium ions, there
are little differences in stability between primary, secondary and

tertiary alkoxides. These results, based on ab initio quantum
calculations with cluster models of zeolite were conﬁrmed by
other research groups [17–23]. Transition states are energeti-
cally excited ion pairs obtained by elongation of the alkoxides
C O bonds, the alkyl pairs resembling carbenium ions in geom-
etry and charge (highly positive). This explains why the classical
carbenium ion theory, although formally not exact, succeeds in
explaining the cracking product distribution.
It should however be underscored that the local geometry of
the zeolite acid sites can strongly inﬂuence the geometry and
stability of alkoxide intermediates and in certain cases stabilize

the ionic transition states, which could make possible reactions
expectedasveryslowonthestabilityofthecarbeniumiontransi-
tion states. It could be why [24,25] the selective skeletal n-butene
isomerization over HFER and HTON would occur through a
monomolecular mechanism which in principle involves very
unstable primary carbenium ions as transition states.
There are several ways to explain the initiation step (i.e., the
formation of the ﬁrst alkoxides) of alkane cracking over acidic
zeolites [8,26]. Firstly, there can be alkene impurities in the feed
which are much keener towards the interaction with acid sites
than alkanes. It is important to point out that alkenes can also be
produced by thermal cracking. Secondly, zeolites are not pure
Brønsted acid catalysts. Varying with the zeolite, there are small
or large amounts of extraframework aluminium species dis-
persed within the micropores or on the external surface and also
framework defects. These species which are generally Lewis
acid sites could activate alkanes. Lastly, according to Haag and
Dessau [27], alkanes can also be transformed into oleﬁns (and
to other products: hydrogen or alkanes) on the zeolite Brønsted
acid sites (protolytic dehydrogenation or cracking). Over cer-
tain zeolites and under chosen operating conditions, in particular
at high temperatures (>500 ◦C) and low conversions, the prod-
ucts resulting from this transformation can be observed in large
amounts, whereas at low temperatures and high conversions,
they serve only for the initiation of the carbenium ion-chain
mechanism.
2.1.2. The protolytic mechanism
The Haag and Dessau mechanism [27] based on Olah’s
superacid chemistry [28] is a monomolecular mechanism.
According to this mechanism, zeolites protonate alkanes at high
temperatures to give unstable transition states known as carbo-
nium ions. These carbonium ions can easily collapse (Fig. 3) to
produce H2 (step 1) or small alkanes (step 2): methane, ethane,
etc. plus carbenium ions (or rather the already mentioned alkox-
ides). The elected route, protolytic cracking or dehydrogenation,
will depend if the proton attacks a C C bond or a C H bond of
the reacting alkane.
Table 1 shows that in the transformation of C2–C4 alkanes
over HMFI at 500 ◦C, all the products expected from this mech-
anism are formed as primary products [29–32]. The reactivity of
alkanes can also be explained through this mechanism: butanes
are 4-times more reactive than propane and 100-times more than
ethane. Moreover, a reaction order of one was found at low par-
tial pressure of reactant in agreement with this monomolecular
reaction.
Incomparisonwiththecarbeniumion-chainmechanism,pro-
tolysis is favored at high reaction temperatures, small partial
pressures of alkane and low conversions [27]. These features
can be related respectively with the higher activation energy
(carbonium ions are more unstable than carbenium ion transi-
tion states), the monomolecular nature of protolysis and the fact
that alkenes resulting from protolysis act as initiators of the chain
mechanism.
In which regards the zeolite properties, the relevant factors
are the size of the channels and cages and the strength and
density of the acid protonic sites. Indeed, because of steric con-
134

straints on the formation of the bimolecular transition states of
the chain mechanism, the relative signiﬁcance of this mechanism
decreases with the size of the space available at the vicinity of
the acid sites, hence protolysis appears as favored over narrow
pores zeolites [27,33–35]. Furthermore, the more energetically
demanding protolysis mechanism requires very strong protonic
sites, such as those resulting from interaction of bridging OH
groups with extraframework Al species or structure defects with
Lewis acidity [36]. Lastly, low acid site densities penalize the
bimolecular demanding mechanism [37–40], hence increase the
relative signiﬁcance of protolysis.
Protolytic cracking and dehydrogenation of alkanes involv-
ing steps in which C H and O H bonds are broken and formed,
the rate of H/D exchange between light and deuterated reactants
can yield information on the nature of the kinetically limit-
ing steps [41,42]. The rate of exchange between n(H10)–n(D10)
butane molecules and between (H8)–(D8) propane molecules
over HMFI at high temperatures (450–550 ◦C) was found to
be 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the rates of protolytic
cracking and dehydrogenation. Hydrogen exchange proceeds
stepwise, i.e., only one H (or D) of the substrate is exchanged in
a single catalytic turnover. The activation energy of exchange
was found lower than those of dehydrogenation and crack-
ing: ∼80 kJ mol−1 against 115 and 135 kJ mol−1. Therefore, the
C H bond activation step of alkanes which is involved in alkane
dehydrogenation cannot be the kinetically limiting step of this
reaction. HMFI activates C H bonds very effectively but it can-
not dispose rapidly of the resulting hydrogen atoms. Therefore,
according to Biscardi and Iglesia [43,44] these atoms are used to
re-hydrogenate hence to desorb carbenium ions from the zeolite
surface.
H/D exchange between light propane or isobutane and deuter-
ated acid catalysts: zeolites, sulfated zirconia, heteropolyacids
was also investigated but at lower temperatures (<300 ◦C and
generally <100 ◦C). As could be expected, H/D exchange under
these conditions was shown to proceed through the carbenium
ion-chain mechanism [45,46,47].
The ﬁrst stages of propane 2-13C activation were examined
by 13C MAS NMR [48]. Scrambling of 13C was shown to occur
at short reaction times (>5 min) at 300 ◦C. To explain this scram-
bling two parallel transformations of proponium ions resulting
from propane protonation over strong acid sites were proposed:
isomerization into C-ethanemethonium ions and transformation
into H2 and isopropyl carbenium ions which rearrange into
cycloproponium ions both followed by propane desorption.
Theoretical chemistry allowed some advances in the descrip-
tion of the transition states of protolysis. Kramer et al. [49] were
theﬁrsttoinferaboutthefeaturesofadsorbedcarboniumionsfor
the methane H/D exchange reaction. According to their results,
carbonium ions were highly energetic transition states, stabi-
lized by nearly covalent interactions of two of their protons
with two partially negative framework oxygen atoms bonded
to aluminum atoms. Kazansky et al. [50,51] and Collins and
O’Malley [52–54] reached to similar conclusions for the protol-
ysis of methane, but also of ethane (Fig. 4), propane and butane.
Moreover, their calculations also indicated that carbonium ions
with more than two carbon atoms would crack to form an alkane
and an alkene instead of an alkoxide species. Similar conclusions
were drawn by other authors [22,23,55–59].
2.1.3. Conclusion
It is now well admitted that over acid zeolites, the acti-
vation of light alkanes may occur not only through the clas-
sical carbenium ion-chain mechanism but also through pro-
tolysis of the C H or C C bonds via carbonium ion transi-
tion states. However, some observations such as the apparent
limitation of protolytic dehydrogenation by hydrogen desorp-
tion are not completely understood. Over constrained zeolites

such as HMFI, at high temperatures (>500 ◦C) and low conver-
sions, essentially the products expected from protolysis can be
observed, whereas over non-constrained zeolites (e.g. HFAU),
particularly at low temperatures and high conversions, protoly-
sis only participates as initiation step of the carbenium ion-chain
mechanism.
2.2. Disproportionation and isomerization
On protonic zeolites, disproportionation of pure C3–C4 alka-
nes appears around 250 ◦C; ethane remains practically unreac-
tive [60]. Propane is much less reactive than n-butane (50-times
over HMOR) leading essentially to an equimolar mixture of
ethane and butanes. From n-butane, isobutane is formed in addi-
tion to the disproportionation products: propane and pentanes
[60].
2.2.1. Reaction mechanism
n-Butane transformation was mainly investigated over
HMOR zeolites which, owing to their high acid strength are
the most active zeolite catalysts for n-butane isomerization (a
commercially important process). Therefore, low operating tem-
peratures could be used, which because of thermodynamic con-
straints constitutes a signiﬁcant advantage [8].
Under the following conditions: ﬁxed bed reactor, 250 ◦C,
butane partial pressure <0.1 bar, nitrogen being used as a diluent,
there is an initial increase in activity followed by a slow decrease.
After the initial period of activation, an apparent kinetic order
with respect to the reactant (n-butane or isobutane) close to 2
was found for both isomerization and disproportionation over
HMOR 10 (Si/Al = 10). It can therefore be concluded that both
reactions occur through the same bimolecular mechanism [60].
The carbenium ion-chain mechanism [7] presented in Fig. 5
shows how n-butane can be transformed by similar steps into
isobutane or into propane and pentanes. Five different steps are
involved: formation of butyl carbenium ions through hydride
transfer from n-butane molecules to pre-existing carbenium ions
R+ (step 1), desorption of n-butene molecules from the protonic
sites (step 2), reaction between butyl carbenium ions and n-
butene molecules with formation of octyl carbenium ions (step
3), rearrangement of these ions (step 4) then cracking of the
rearranged ones (step 5), lastly desorption of alkanes (steps 6 and
6′ from the C3, C4, C5 carbenium ions and oleﬁns resulting from
step 5). It should be remarked that steps 6 and 6′ are identical
136
G. Caeiro et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 255 (2006) 131–158
to the reverse of step 2 and to step 1, respectively, hence that
the carbenium ions R+ involved in step 1 are those of steps 6
and 6′. All the steps of this bimolecular mechanism involve only
secondary and tertiary carbenium ions as transition states, hence
are facile to be catalyzed. With this mechanism, the only way to
account for the value of 2 of the reaction order is to admit that
the limiting step is bimolecular, which is only the case for step 3.
Furthermore, the initial period of activation could correspond to
a progressive increase of the concentration of the R+ carbenium
ions.
A very important remark is that through this mechanism
isobutane and propane plus pentanes should be simultane-
ously formed as apparent primary products, in contradiction

steps and carbenium ion-chain mechanism. R=, R+, RH: alkene intermediates,

pentanes).
to what was sometimes proposed, i.e., that isobutane is a
primary product, whereas propane and pentanes would be
secondarily formed. An example is given below (Eq. (1))
showing that both formations of isobutane (+n-butane) and
propane + pentanes can involve the same steps: type-A isomer-
ization (through alkyl shift) and type-B cracking (i.e., with
the intervention of one tertiary and one secondary carbenium
ions)
(1)
Another important point to be underlined is that the selec-
tivity to isobutane should depend on the degree of isomer-
ization of the C8 carbenium ions. If isomerization occurs
only through alkyl shift (type A isomerization), the selec-
tivity will be low (only ∼33%) because the formation of
propane + pentanes and isobutane + n-butane involves the same
steps and the same carbenium ions (Eq. (1)), hence should
occur at similar rates. On the opposite, if all the C8+ carbe-
nium ions can be formed, which requires type B isomeriza-
tion (i.e., through protonated cyclopropane transition states),
isobutane will be formed through a very facile type A crack-
ing step (i.e., which involves two tertiary carbenium ions) (Eq.
(2)),
(2)
although the formation of propane + pentanes will occur neces-
sarilly through the more difﬁcult type B cracking steps.
Experiments with 13C labelled reactants: [1-13C] n-butane,
[1-13C] and [2-13C] isobutane conﬁrm the bimolecular iso-
merization mechanism [61]. Indeed the isomerization products
contain more species with no or two 13C atoms than the reac-
tant [7], hence cannot result (only) from a monomolecular
process. Furthermore, the facile type A rearrangements [15]
are not enough to explain the formation of these species (Eq.
(3)):
G. Caeiro et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 255 (2006) 131–158
137
(3)
Therefore, the rearrangement of octyl carbenium ions (step
4) of Fig. 5) involves not only type A rearrangements but also
several type B rearrangements (Eq. (4)), which could explain
the high selectivity to isobutane.
(4)
The effect of hydrogen on n-butane transformation [62,63]
suggests the possibility of a monomolecular isomerization of n-
butane over HMOR zeolites. Indeed hydrogen has a signiﬁcant
inhibiting effect on n-butane isomerization: apparent reaction
order of ≃1. Furthermore, under hydrogen there is no more
activation period, the selectivity to isobutane is greater and the
order with respect to n-butane equal to ∼1 (instead of 2 under
nitrogen) as could be expected from a monomolecular process.
However, the rate of this process was estimated to be much
lower, ∼15-times more than that of the bimolecular one. This
is not surprising, the monomolecular process of n-butane iso-
merization involving very unstable primary carbenium ions as
transition states (Eq. (5)):
(5)
The inhibiting effect of hydrogen on the bimolecular transfor-
mations of n-butane was explained [62,63] by a large decrease
in the concentration of the sec-butyl carbenium ions caused by
the following reaction (Eq. (6)):
(6)
138
G. Caeiro et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 255 (2006) 131–158
which reduces signiﬁcantly the rate of the limiting step (step 3)
in Fig. 5) of the bimolecular mechanism.
In the mechanism described in Fig. 5, the alkenes correspond-
ing to the reactant are involved as intermediates. This explains
why the addition of a small amount of isobutene to isobutane
increases signiﬁcantly the initial rate of isobutane transforma-
tion [64–67]. An increase can also be observed when propene
or ethene are added to isobutane. This could be expected since
these oleﬁns are rapidly transformed into carbenium ions R+
which can participate through hydride transfer in the formation
of tert-butyl carbenium ions. Besides this positive effect on the
initial rate, the addition of alkenes has a negative effect on the
catalyst stability [68].
Some authors [66] have proposed that isomerization and dis-
proportionation of isobutane over HMOR zeolites occur only in
presence of alkene traces in the feed. However, the formation
of a small amount of methane and hydrogen which is generally
observed, is a strong argument in favour of alkane protolysis
on the strong protonic sites of HMOR zeolites as initiation step
(Fig. 5), hence against this proposal [67].
2.2.2. Inﬂuence of the acidity and pore structure of the
zeolite catalysts
Experiments with pyridine poisoning or exchange by sodium
ions of a HMOR(10) sample show that only a small fraction
of the protonic sites (the strongest ones) are active in butane
transformation [7]. In agreement with that, a USHY zeolite with
a Si/Al ratio of 5 whose acid sites are weak in comparison to
those of HMOR samples was found to be 110-times less active
than HMOR(10) at 350 ◦C. Moreover, at lower temperatures,
no transformation of pure butane could be observed over this
USHY zeolite [69,70].
n-Butane transformation under nitrogen was carried out over
a series of HMOR samples with Si/Al ratios of ∼7 (non-
dealuminated sample), 10, 20, 60 and 80 (resulting from dealu-
mination) [71]. A linear relation was found between the activity
of these samples (except HMOR7) and the square of the con-
centration of the protonic sites, which suggests a demanding
process, i.e., requiring two acid sites for its catalysis. This seems
possible, two acid sites being involved in step 1 of the bimolec-
ular mechanism (Fig. 5). However, these acid sites do not need
to be adjacent as originally advanced.
HMOR(7) was not only less active (5 times) than expected
from its protonic site concentration but the selectivity to isobu-
tane was much lower (only 25% at low conversions) than over
the dealuminated samples (70–80%) essentially at the beneﬁt of
propane[71].ThelowactivityandselectivityofHMOR(7)could
be related to the absence of mesopores in this non-dealuminated
sample and therefore to the much longer diffusion pathway for
hydrocarbon molecules. As a consequence whereas the reactant
molecules diffuse along the channels they can undergo many
successive bimolecular reactions with a preferential formation
of propane. Indeed butanes and pentanes are more reactive than
propane and can be transformed into this product (Eq. (7)):
(7)
This type of shape selectivity related to the unidirectional
pore system of mordenite, which was found for the ﬁrst time in
xylene isomerization over Al-containing MCM41 samples, was
called tunnel-shape selectivity [72,73]. This shape selectivity
can also account for the low apparent activity of HMOR7. Indeed
the transformation in a large channel of each n-butane molecule
involves all the protonic sites of this channel, which therefore
appear to have a low efﬁciency.
The “diameter” of the channels of mono-dimensional zeo-
lites has a very signiﬁcant effect on activity and selectivity [74].
Thus, the turnover frequency of the protonic sites decreases
signiﬁcantly from 7–14 h−1 with HMOR (∅= 4.5–7 ˚
A) to
0.13 h−1 with HTON (∅= 4.6 × 5.7 ˚
A) and 0.06 h−1 with HFER
(∅= 4.2 × 5.4 ˚
A). At ∼250 ◦C, the selectivity to isobutane of
TON is slightly smaller than that of HMOR (∼70% against
∼80%), whereas that of HFER is very low (∼5%), the prod-
ucts expected from a monomolecular cracking and especially
ethane and methane being predominant. Diffusion limitations
could explain from a large part the apparent low activity of the
protonic sites of HTON and HFER. With this latter zeolite, steric
constraints could also limit the formation of bimolecular inter-
mediates.
It is probably for the same reasons that the protonic
sites of HMFI, a tri-dimensional average pore size zeolite
(∅= 5.1 × 5.5 ˚
A ↔5.3 × 5.6 ˚
A), were found to be 15-times less
active than those of HMOR and that the selectivity to isobutane
was very low (propane was the major product) [74,75].
2.2.3. Conclusion
Owing to the high acid strength of their protonic sites and to
the relatively large diameter of their channels, HMOR zeolites
are the most active and selective zeolites for n-butane isomer-
ization. The presence of mesopores which limit the length of
the diffusion path is however indispensable to reach the opti-
mal activity and selectivity. These mesopores which make the
pore structure quasi tri-dimensional [76] have also a signiﬁ-
cant effect on the catalytic stability. With this zeolite at least
at low temperatures (∼250 ◦C), n-butane transforms essentially
through a dimerization–isomerization–cracking mechanism. A
very small part of n-butane isomerization seems to occur through
a monomolecular mechanism. However, the existence of this
mechanism deserves to be conﬁrmed and the nature of the cor-
responding transition state (either carbonium or carbenium ions)
to be speciﬁed.
2.3. Light alkanes aromatization
The alkenes resulting from protolysis of light alkanes or/and
from hydrogen transfer reactions are very reactive in acid catal-
ysis. Therefore, at the high temperatures required for their for-
mation over acid zeolites, they can undergo various secondary
reactionsleadingtothermodynamicallystableproducts,i.e.,aro-
matic hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons formed in the zeolite
micropores can, depending on their properties (size and polar-
ity) and on those of the pore system, either desorb or remain
trapped. In this latter case, these compounds (called carbona-
ceous deposits or coke) limit or block the access to the active

139
sites with as a consequence a decrease in activity [77]. This
decrease in activity can be very fast (e.g. mono-dimensional
zeolites or zeolites with trap cages, i.e., large cages with small
apertures), slow and even very slow. MFI is an example of zeo-
lite for which the deactivation by coking is very slow owing to its
tridimensional pore system and to a size of channel intersections
(≈cages) close to the size of the channel diameters: practically
all the molecules formed at these channel intersections can dif-
fuse in the channels [78]. Another advantage of this zeolite, well
demonstrated in the methanol to gasoline process (MTG), is the
limitation by steric constraints at the channel intersections of the
growth of bulky products with as a consequence essentially the
formation of valuable benzenic hydrocarbons. It is why most of
the studies of alkane aromatization were carried out over MFI
zeolites. Nevertheless the medium pore size MEL zeolite which
has similar characteristics: tridimensional, no trap cages can also
be used [79].
2.3.1. Reaction scheme
The alkane aromatization process can be divided in two
stages: the transformation of light alkanes into oleﬁnic prod-
ucts which was described above and the transformation of these
oleﬁnicproductsintoaromatichydrocarbons(seepropanearom-
atization scheme in Fig. 6). The second stage proceeds through
a number of reactions involving alkoxide intermediates and
carbenium ions as transition states. Ethylene and propene result-
ing from propane transformation (ﬁrst stage in Fig. 6) undergo
oligomerization–cracking reactions leading to C4–C10 oleﬁns.
Hydrogen transfer from these oleﬁns to other oleﬁns leads to the
formation of the corresponding dienes (and of alkanes). Dienes
undergocyclization(intramolecularoligomerization),theresult-
ing cycloalkenes being transformed into cyclic dioleﬁns by
hydrogen transfer. The last step is the transformation of cyclic
dioleﬁns into aromatics through hydrogen transfer (a stoichio-
metric dehydrogenation could also be possible at the high reac-
tion temperature). An important remark is that as a consequence
of the hydrogen transfer steps involved in aromatization (steps
2, 4, 6 and 7 in Fig. 6), aromatic formation is balanced by the
formation of alkanes at the expense of alkenes, with therefore a
limitation in aromatic production.
Kinetic modeling of propene [80] and of propane [81] arom-
atization over HMFI allows an estimation of the rate constants
of the various steps of Fig. 6. Oleﬁn formation (steps 1 and
2) was found to be kinetically limiting [82,83] in agreement
with the much higher reactivity of alkenes compared to alka-
nes. This step was found to be 103-times slower than step 4
(diene formation) which is the slowest step of propene arom-
atization. Diene formation is 105-times slower than the fastest
step (step 7), aromatic formation) and 104–105 times slower than
oligomerization–cracking (step 3), diene cyclization and cyclic
dioleﬁn formation (step 6) [80].
As shown above for protolysis, the rate of aromatization
depends very much on the alkane reactant. Furthermore the
desired aromatic products are accompanied by a large amount
of alkanes resulting from both protolysis and hydrogen-transfer
reactions. Nonetheless, an aromatization process was devel-
oped by Mobil for converting light hydrocarbons to BTX aro-
matics over a HMFI catalyst. However, in this process called
M2 forming, the feed is constituted by a mixture of alka-
nes and alkenes (not by only alkanes) [84]. The aromatics
yield is limited by the stoichiometric constraint imposed by
the hydrogen contents of feed and products: unsaturated hydro-
carbons increase both the global conversion and the yield in
aromatics.

2.3.2. Conclusion
At high temperatures (>500 ◦C), purely acidic zeolites are
able to catalyse the aromatization of light alkanes, with however
two major drawbacks: (i) their deactivation by carbonaceous
deposits which is generally very fast, except however with con-
strained zeolites such as HMFI and HMEL and (ii) their selectiv-
ity to aromatics which is very poor due to alkane formation both
by protolytic cracking and by hydrogen transfer from aromatic
precursors to oleﬁn intermediates.
2.4. Alkylation of isobutane with n-butene
The alkylate resulting from conversion of isobutane/n-butene
mixturesisahighlydesirablehighoctanegasolinecut[8,85–89].
The established alkylation technologies use either concentrated
sulphuric acid or anhydrous hydroﬂuoric acid catalysts, with
obvious security and environmental concern. There is therefore a
genuine desire to develop more environment-friendly catalysts.
Much effort has been put in the search for a solid alkylation
catalystwithunfortunatelyrelativelylittlesuccess.Zeoliteswere
the most investigated, the main problem in their use being their
fast deactivation. It is why after a short presentation of alkylation
chemistry, essentially the recent advances in deactivation and
regeneration of zeolite catalysts will be discussed.
2.4.1. Chemistry of alkylation
Alkylation is a very complex process leading as expected
(from
isobutane
and
n-butene
reactants)
essentially
to
trimethylpentanes but also to a large variety of other desorbed
products with a number of C atoms between 4 and 14 and to
non-desorbed products [8,85–89]. On the fresh zeolite catalysts,
butenecanbetotallyconverted,withformationofﬁvefamiliesof
alkanes: n-butane and four families with tertiary carbon atoms:
C5–C7 (called light ends), the desired trimethylpentanes (TMP),
other C8 alkanes, mainly dimethylhexanes (DMH), C9–C14
alkanes (heavy ends). After a certain reaction time, butene con-
version begins to drop with simultaneously a signiﬁcant change
in the product composition with appearance of C8 alkenes result-
ing from butene dimerization. A plateau of conversion is ﬁnally
reached at which essentially these C8 alkenes can be observed
[86]. Only weak protonic sites are needed for this very facile
reaction of dimerization (cf Section 2.3.1), whereas alkylation
would require strong sites.
The classical alkylation cycle advanced to explain the forma-
tion of TMP from an isobutane/2-butene mixture is presented in
Fig. 7. Three types of steps would be involved: butene addition to
tert-butyl carbenium ions (step 1), isomerization through H shift
(2a) and/or CH3 shift(s) (2b), hydride transfer from isobutane to
the C8 carbenium ions (step 3). The initiation step of this car-
benium ion-chain mechanism is the hydride transfer (HT) from
isobutane to sec-butyl carbenium ions resulting from butene pro-
tonation (Eq. (8)):
(8)
HT to secondary carbenium ions such as the sec-butyl car-
benium ions is known to be much slower than HT to tertiary
carbenium ions (e.g. step 3), which explains that except butane,
only alkanes with tertiary carbon atoms can be observed in the
products.
Although2,2,3-TMPshouldbetheprimaryproductofalkyla-
tion, the selectivity to this product is always quite low (<10% of
theTMP).Severalexplanationscouldbeadvancedtoexplainthis
observation: namely steric difﬁculty in the approach of isobu-
tane from the positive charge of the corresponding carbenium
ion which is protected by the tert-butyl groups [90], participation
of other reactions in the formation of TMP. This latter proposal is
most likely, for 2,3,3-TMP is primarily formed in large amounts
over a USHY zeolite although the corresponding hydride trans-
fershouldsufferfromsimilarstericconstraintsastheoneleading
to 2,2,3-TMP. The comparison of isobutane/2-butene and isobu-
tane/propene transformations over a USHY zeolite demonstrates
the existence of a self-alkylation of isobutane with formation of
2,2,4-TMP [91]. The mechanism of this reaction developed in
reference [91] involves successively the formation of isobutene
from tert-butyl carbenium ions, the addition of this oleﬁn on the
tert-butyl carbenium ion, then hydride transfer. Other reactions
are necessary to explain the formation of all the products:
- Dimerization of n-butenes followed by hydride transfer to
account for the dimethylhexane products.
- Alkylation of C8 carbenium ions by butene molecules fol-
lowed by cracking and hydride transfer to account for the
heavy and light ends.
- Formation of heavy unsaturated species responsible for the
deactivation of the strong acid sites with change from alkyla-
tion to oligomerization reactions.
2.4.2. How to limit deactivation?
All the authors agree that deactivation is due to the formation
and retention within the zeolite micropores of heavy products.
Of course, the knowledge of their composition and of their effect
on the active sites (poisoning, blockage of their access) is indis-
pensable for ﬁnding ways to increase the catalyst stability and
to design an efﬁcient regeneration method [86].
Despite of that, there are few studies devoted to the character-
ization of carbonaceous deposits and of the deactivated zeolite
catalysts. The characterization techniques that were applied are
elemental analysis [92], 13C NMR spectroscopy [93–95], FT-IR
spectroscopy [95–101], UV–vis spectroscopy [92,95,100,101],
temperature programmed oxidation [100–103], matrix assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy
(MALDI-TOF) [99] and dissolution of the zeolite in HF solu-
tion with subsequent extraction and analysis of the organic phase
[96,99] by GC, FT-IR, H NMR, MS and GC/MS coupling. Note
that only the characterization of the carbonaceous deposits after

separation from the zeolite can lead to their composition, i.e.,
the distribution of their components as a function of their nature
andoftheirsize.However,thecharacterizationofthedeactivated
catalysts is also indispensable, in particular for specifying the
interaction between the molecules of carbonaceous compounds
and the acidic sites.
The composition of the carbonaceous deposits depends on the
operating conditions, and especially on reaction time and oper-
ating temperature [99]. Whereas, there are some differences in
the conclusions of the studies, most of the authors agree with the
presence of heavy (up to 30 [96] or to 35 [99] C atoms), unsat-
urated highly branched species containing cycles. The atomic
H/C ratio measured by Klingmann et al. [92] was equal to 1.6,
whereas a slightly higher value 1.7–1.8 can be deduced from the
results of other studies [96,99]. According to Feller et al. [99],
aromatic compounds are present in carbonaceous compounds,
their amount increasing with reaction temperature, whereas no
aromatics were found by others [92,96]. The number of unsatu-
rations in the carbonaceous compounds was concluded to be 2
from the presence of a band at 305 nm in the UV–vis spec-
trum originating from monoenylic carbocations [92]; on the
other hand, from hydrogenation of carbonaceous compounds,
Pater et al. [96] suggested the presence of only one double
bond.
IR spectroscopy analysis of the “coked” zeolite samples
shows that coke molecules interact with the protonic sites:
indeed there is a partial or a complete disappearance of the bands
corresponding to the bridging hydroxyl groups [96,99]. This
interaction is responsible for the catalyst deactivation through
poisoning of the acidic sites at high temperatures (130 ◦C) and
probably through pore blocking at low temperatures (40 ◦C)
[99].
Condensation reactions are necessarily involved in the forma-
tion of the carbonaceous deposits. Therefore, limiting the growth
of product molecules seems one of the best ways to increase the
catalyst lifetime. Bulky molecules can result from oligomeriza-
tion or from alkylation of octyl carbenium ions (C8+) precur-
sors of TMP by butene molecules. Trimerization of butenes or
monoalkylation of C8+ lead to C12 carbenium ions which are
precursors of light and heavy ends. However, these C12 carbe-
nium ions can also lead by alkylation with butene to heavier
compounds. All these reactions of condensation are similar to
oligomerization. It is why most of the authors agree with the
proposal that the lifetime of the alkylation catalyst is mainly
determined by the relative rates of hydride transfer (HT) and of
oligomerization (O) [104]. The higher the HT/O ratio the greater
the yield in alkylation products and the smaller the formation
of carbonaceous deposits hence the slower the deactivation. It
142

should be noted that this condition is not easy to be satisﬁed
for the rate constant of oligomerization is much greater than the
rate constant of hydride transfer: 2 [104] to 3 [105] orders of
magnitude.
However, a stability increase can be obtained by an adequate
choice of the zeolite catalyst, of the reactor and of the oper-
ating conditions [86,90,104]. Thus, hydride transfer requires
strong acid sites with in addition a signiﬁcant positive effect
of their density [37–40]; moreover, this reaction involves a
bulky bimolecular transition state. As a consequence, a large
pore zeolite such as FAU with the greatest possible concentra-
tion of acidic sites (e.g. X rather than Y) will be chosen. TMP
molecules being relatively bulky limitations in their desorption
from the zeolite micropores [106] could occur with therefore
an increase in the secondary reactions of condensation involved
in the formation of carbonaceous deposits. The use of zeolites
with small crystallites will reduce these limitations. Thus, the
small size of the HBEA crystals could be one of the reasons for
the good stability of this zeolite [106]. Lastly the signiﬁcance
of oligomerization which involves two or more molecules of
butene will be lower if n-butene concentration is kept very low
throughout the reactor. This could be achieved by using a contin-
uous stirred tank reactor (a ﬁxed bed reactor is not suitable) with
high isobutane/n-butene ratios and low n-butene space veloci-
ties [86,90,104]. Reaction temperature was also shown to have
a signiﬁcant effect on the lifetime with a maximum at 75 ◦C
(over a LaX catalyst). Faster deactivation at low temperatures
would be due to diffusion limitations with catalyst deactivation
by pore blocking, whereas at high temperatures it could be due
to a faster formation of highly unsaturated compounds which
strongly adsorb on the active sites (site poisoning) [90].
2.4.3. Novel regeneration methods
Due to the rapid deactivation of zeolite catalysts, and that
despite the recent advances (Section 2.4.2), all the industrial
alkylation processes using these catalysts will require a peri-
odical (or even a continuous) regeneration. Oxidative treatment
is classically used to remove carbonaceous deposits from zeo-
lite catalysts. However, this technology which is well adapted
to the removal of coke from the hydrothermally stable zeolite
catalysts employed in high-temperature processes presents as
major inconveniency when applied to the low Si/Al alkylation
zeolite catalysts to decrease their acid site concentration, and
consequently their activity and lifetime. Indeed whereas owing
to their high hydrogen content (H/C = 1.6–1.8), these deposits
could be expected to be oxidized at low temperatures, they
undergo upon heating a change in their structure. Their unsat-
urated aliphatic components adsorbed on the protonic sites are
easily transformed into aromatic compounds which require high
temperatures for their oxidation. It is why novel methods were
investigated to remove the carbonaceous deposits from the alky-
lation zeolite catalysts: oxidation with ozone or with hydrogen
peroxide [104], hydrocracking [92,103,107], supercritical ﬂuid
extraction [100,101,108–113], promising results being obtained
with the last two methods.
Regeneration by hydrocracking, patented 30 years ago [114]
was investigated by two groups [92,103,107,115] and more par-
ticularly by the group of Weitkamp. The operating conditions
for a complete restoration of the activity were determined from
an in situ FT-IR study, the alkylation catalyst (LaX) being doped
with 0.4 wt.% Pt [107]. Hydrocracking at a hydrogen pressure
of 15 bar and temperatures up to 300 ◦C was found to restore
completely the activity and the selectivity: both the duration of
complete conversion of 1-butene and the product composition
were identical in four cycles of alkylation–regeneration [107].
However, this regeneration technology has as major inconve-
niencies to require the addition of Pt to the catalyst and hydro-
gen supply infrastructure, which increases operation and capital
costs.
Supercriticalﬂuidshavebeenexploredforlimitingthedeacti-
vationofsolidalkylationcatalystsbycontinuouslyextractingthe
carbonaceous deposits [116–120]. However, the critical analysis
of the papers [120] shows that the increase in catalyst stability
which is observed is generally accompanied by a reduction in
product quality. More promising was to exploit the extractive
properties of supercritical ﬂuids for dissolving and removing
carbonaceous deposits, hence for reactivating the zeolite cata-
lysts.
Among a variety of supercritical ﬂuids tested, branched alka-
nes (isopentane, isobutane) were the most effective owing to
their ability (because of their tertiary carbon atoms) to desorb
by hydride transfer the heavy unsaturated compounds adsorbed
as enylic carbocations. However, the hydride transfer is not pos-
sible with too deactivated samples [112] either because of the
too small number of residual strong acid sites or to their limited
access. In contrast, very promising results were obtained with
partially deactivated samples. Thus, a simple batch of USHY
zeolite was utilized for up to 23 reactions/regeneration cycle
while maintaining 100% of the initial activity [110].
2.4.4. Conclusion
Signiﬁcant advances have recently been made both in the life-
time of the zeolite catalysts and in their regeneration. Thus, the
lifetime was shown to be signiﬁcantly increased by an adequate
choice of the reactor, catalyst and operating conditions. More-
over, a complete restoration of the initial activity and selectivity
can be obtained by removal of the carbonaceous deposits respon-
sible for deactivation either by hydrocracking or by supercritical
ﬂuid extraction. These advances and the environment-friendly
characteristics of zeolite catalysts should lead in the future to the
development of new alkylation technologies employing these
catalysts.
3. Transformation of light alkanes over metal zeolite
catalysts
The introduction of dehydrogenating species into HMFI: Pt,
Zn, Ga, etc. increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization.
Various commercial processes using bifunctional Ga/HMFI cat-
alysts: cyclar from UOP and BP [121,122], aroforming from
IFP and Salutec [123,124], Z-forming from Mitsubishi and
Chiyoda [125] have been developed for liqueﬁed petroleum
gas (LPG) transformation into BTX hydrocarbons (benzene,
toluene, xylenes) with simultaneous formation of a large amount

143
of hydrogen which is also a valuable product. This has incited
many academic teams to investigate the aromatization of light
alkanes especially propane over Ga/HMFI catalysts.
Another reason is the complexity of both the reaction scheme
and catalyst system. Thus, not only the aromatization scheme is
bifunctional in the meaning of Weisz [126], i.e., scheme con-
stituted of successive reaction steps catalyzed independently by
dehydrogenating and acidic sites with therefore steps of diffu-
sion of desorbed intermediates from one type of site to another
but in addition, the dehydrogenating steps would involve bifunc-
tional sites associating Ga species and protonic acidic sites.
Moreover, as is often the case in bifunctional catalysis processes,
monofunctional catalytic reactions (over Ga species or over pro-
tonic sites) and even stoichiometric reactions can also play a role
in the steps of light alkane transformation. Lastly, major mod-
iﬁcations of the physicochemical properties of the catalyst can
occur during the pre-treatment and even during the reaction,
which makes difﬁcult the identiﬁcation of the actual active Ga
sites.
Section 3.1 is essentially devoted to the main aspects of
light alkane aromatization over GaHMFI catalysts. However,
the effect of other doping metal cations and especially of Zn
cations will also be brieﬂy examined.
The ﬁrst step of light alkane aromatization over GaHMFI cat-
alysts is the alkane dehydrogenation. Thus, it could be envisaged
to limit the alkane transformation to the formation of the corre-
sponding alkene. Unfortunately, alkane dehydrogenation is the
limitingstepofalkanearomatizationandtheselectivitytoalkene
is always poor even at low conversion over Ga-containing,
proton-poor MFI [127]. Much better results can be obtained over
more classical dehydrogenation catalysts based on supported
Pt. However, dehydrogenation reactions being highly endother-
mic (H ≈100 kJ mol−1) are thermodynamically favored only
atveryhightemperatureswithasaconsequencesigniﬁcantprob-
lems of deactivation. An elegant way to bypass the thermody-
namic limitations of dehydrogenation is to eliminate selectively
the resulting hydrogen from its formation, for instance by oxi-
dation. Furthermore, the discovery of the remarkable catalytic
properties of Fe zeolites for the selective oxidation by N2O
of benzene into phenol [128] has led several teams to explore
this oxidation route to transform light alkanes (and especially
propane) into the corresponding oleﬁns. This review paper being
limited to non-oxidative processes, we do not present and dis-
cuss the promising results obtained in oxydehydrogenation of
light alkanes.
In Section 3.2, the association of a hydrogenating function
to the purely acidic zeolites (especially H-mordenite) which are
active in n-butane isomerization [129] will be shown to lead
to signiﬁcant improvements. The possibility of a direct forma-
tionofisobutenefromn-butane(dehydroisomerization)willalso
been examined.
Bifunctional catalysis can also be used for the alkylation
of benzenic hydrocarbons with small alkanes. This one pot
synthesis of valuable alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, presented in
Section 3.3, could constitute an economical and environment-
friendly alternative to their classical production by alkylation
with alkenes.
3.1. Main features of light alkane aromatization
Themainpartofthisparagraphdealswithpropanearomatiza-
tion over Ga/HMFI catalysts. However, the differences between
the modes of action of Zn and Ga/MFI catalysts will be presented
and discussed.
3.1.1. Demonstration (and nature) of a bifunctional
aromatization scheme
Bifunctional pathways can be classiﬁed in two main cate-
gories, either with independent monofunctional sites, hence with
desorbed intermediates, or with bifunctional sites, hence without
desorbed intermediates. The ﬁrst one, which involves successive
chemical steps on the two types of sites, often redox and acid
ones, and diffusion steps of desorbed intermediates from the
redox to the acid sites and vice-versa plays an important role in
numerous processes of reﬁning, petrochemicals and ﬁne chem-
icals. The participation of this pathway can be demonstrated by
using intimate physical mixtures of the monofunctional compo-
nents with different concentrations [126,130]. Indeed, despite
the separation of the two functions, a synergy effect can be
observed, i.e., the activity of the mixtures is deﬁnitely greater
than the sum of the activities of their components. It is actually
the case for propane conversion and aromatization over mix-
tures of Ga2O3 and HMFI pretreated under nitrogen at 600 ◦C
[131]. However, this observation is not a deﬁnite proof. Indeed,
it could also be explained by modiﬁcations of one component
in presence of the other one during the catalyst activation or
during the reaction with an increase of activity. It will be shown
later that this type of complication can exist with Ga2O3/HMFI
catalysts pretreated under hydrogen or used for a long time in
aromatization at high temperatures. It is less likely in the exper-
iments reported in reference [131] for the activities were mea-
sured at very short time-on-stream on samples pretreated under
nitrogen.
However, to demonstrate without any ambiguity the existence
of this type of bifunctional mechanism on the actual aromati-
zation catalysts, the acid and dehydrogenating activities of the
physical mixtures of Ga2O3 and HMFI have to be estimated
after the activation treatment under conditions representative of
aromatization, i.e., in presence of hydrogen at high tempera-
tures. If propane aromatization involves successive reactions on
independent sites, a curve similar to that represented in Fig. 8a
should be obtained [131]. In this ﬁgure, the ratio R between
the activity for propane aromatization and the acid activity is
taken as the ordinate and the dehydrogenation/acid activity ratio
(De/Ac) as the abscissa. For low values of De/Ac, dehydrogena-
tion is the limiting step, hence the bifunctional activity per acid
site is proportional to De/Ac. For high values of De/Ac, the acid
reaction is limiting and the bifunctional activity will be propor-
tional to the acid activity, hence R will be constant. Whatever the
model reactions accounted for estimating the acid and the dehy-
drogenating activities, R was found to increase proportionally to
De/Ac. Examples of this linear relationship are shown in Fig. 8b
for Ga2O3/HMFI physical mixtures pretreated under nitrogen.
The increase of R with De/Ac demonstrates the existence of a
bifunctional pathway with desorbed intermediates, whereas the

linear relationship shows that propane aromatization is kineti-
cally limited by the dehydrogenation steps [131].
The main chemical and physical steps involved in the bifunc-
tional scheme are shown in Fig. 9. Steps 1, 5, 9 and 10
can occur through dehydrogenation, whereas steps 3 and 7
(oligomerization–cracking and cyclization) are necessarily cat-
alyzed by protonic acid sites. Steps 2, 4, 6 and 8 correspond to
the migration of desorbed intermediates from dehydrogenation
sites to protonic sites and vice-versa. The participation of Ga
species in steps 1, 5, 9 and 10 was demonstrated through kinetic
modeling of propane and propene aromatization over Ga/HMFI
[80,81] catalysts as well as by the use of model reactions [131].
The much higher reactivity of propene compared to propane as
well as the apparent direct formation of aromatics from propene
are strong arguments in favor of the kinetic limitation of propane
aromatization by propane dehydrogenation (step 1 in Fig. 9).
3.1.2. Other reactions involved in propane transformation
over Ga/HMFI catalysts
As it is often the case on bifunctional catalysts, the bifunc-
tional pathway is accompanied by monofunctional reactions,
here catalyzed either by the protonic sites or by the dehydro-
genating species. Thus, as it was demonstrated in propane and
propene aromatization over HMFI (without Ga), the zeolite pro-
tonic sites are able to catalyze steps 1, 5, 9 and 10 of Fig. 9.
Steps 5, 9 and 10 occur essentially through hydrogen transfer
from long chain, and cyclic oleﬁns and dienes to light alkenes,
as it was already referred in Section 2.2. On the other hand,
step 1 occurs partly through protolysis partly through hydride
transfer (Fig. 6). In addition to propene, the protolytic attack of
propane yields also methane plus ethylene. Moreover, the com-
petitionforadsorptionovertheprotonicacidsitesofthearomatic
molecules with the less basic parafﬁnic and oleﬁnic molecules
affects signiﬁcantly the rates of reactions 1, 5, 9 and 10 [80,81].
Furthermore Ga species were shown to be able to catalyze
not only the dehydrogenating steps but also propane crack-
ing into methane and ethylene, the hydrogenation of oleﬁns,
in particular of ethylene, and the hydrogenolysis of methyl
aromatics [80,81,83,132]. A recent study of propane transfor-
mation at 500 ◦C over different polymorphs of Ga2O3 conﬁrms
the catalytic activity of this oxide for propane dehydrogena-
tion and cracking [133]. -Ga2O3 which has the largest amount
of acidic sites was the most active and selective for propene
formation. Gallium oxide being hardly reduced below 600 ◦C
and the reduced oxide being not restored after O2 treatment,
propane dehydrogenation was proposed to occur (like on ZnO)
through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than through a
redox mechanism. In agreement with this proposal, dihydrogen
molecules were demonstrated to be dissociated over Ga2O3 into
H+ and H−species [134]. The results obtained by H2 (or D2)
adsorption followed by IR spectroscopy are very similar to those
found over ZnO [135]. H2 adsorption gives rise to two IR bands
at 3640 and 2020 cm−1, these bands being shifted to 2680 and
1450 cm−1 when H2 is substituted by D2. The ﬁrst one was pro-

hydride species (Gax+–H).
3.1.3. Dehydrogenation steps. A bifunctional mechanism?
The highest dehydrogenating activity of the -Ga2O3 poly-
morph was attributed to a conjugated effect of protonic and
oxide sites [133]. This synergy effect is well demonstrated in
the case of Ga/HMFI catalysts. Thus, Ga2O3/HMFI samples are
more active in propane aromatization than pure HMFI although
Ga2O3 is completely inactive [131]. This is mainly due to a
synergy effect on propene formation (which, as referred earlier,
is the limiting step of aromatization) as furthermore shown in
experiments carried out at low propane conversion [131].
Thus, Table 2 shows that for physical Ga2O3–HMFI mixtures
pretreated at 600 ◦C either under nitrogen or under hydrogen
ﬂow, the value of the dehydrogenating activity per gram of the
gallium oxide component (DGa) is much higher for the mixture
than for the pure oxide. The smaller the percentage of gallium
oxide, the greater the DGa increase, this increase being more
pronounced after pretreatment under hydrogen. Thus, for the
catalyst with the lowest percentage of gallium oxide (2.7 wt.%),
DGa is about 2500- and 700-times greater than for pure gallium
oxide after pretreatment under hydrogen and nitrogen, respec-
tively. The continuous increase of DGa with the percentage of
the zeolite component in the catalyst could be expected. Indeed
the gallium species active in dehydrogenation become more and
more close to the acid sites.
Likewise, if the dehydrogenation activity is considered to be
due to the acidic sites, the dehydrogenating activity has to be
estimated per gram of zeolite (DA). DA was found to be greater
with the Ga2O3–HMFI mixtures than with the pure zeolite. Here
the signiﬁcance of the synergy effect depends only slightly on
the catalyst composition. Nonetheless, an apparent maximum
of DA is found for a wt.% of Ga2O3 of 13.4 (DA is 170-times
greater than for the pure zeolite) and of 6.7 (210-times greater)
for the samples pretreated under nitrogen and under hydrogen,
respectively. This maximum in the DA value is unexpected, the
closest proximity of the acid sites to the gallium oxide which
should be favorable to the zeolite activity being for mixtures
rich in Ga2O3 [131].
Two types of mechanisms were advanced to explain these
changes of DGa and DA with the catalyst composition. In the
ﬁrst one (a), propane would be activated over the Ga species
[4,136,137], in the second (b) over the protonic sites [138–142].
However, a third possible explanation could be found in the sig-
niﬁcant modiﬁcations of the catalyst which were found to occur
during hydrogen pretreatment or during the reaction (because
of hydrogen production) [131,136,143–149]. However, this lat-
ter explanation which probably accounts for the increase in the
dehydrogenation activity with hydrogen pretreatment (Table 2),
does not seem to be valid to account for the change in the dehy-
drogenation activity of the nitrogen pretreated samples with the
catalyst composition. Indeed the activity was measured on fresh
catalysts, whereas the catalyst modiﬁcations require long-term
exposure to the propane reactant [131]. A stronger argument
in favor of the bifunctional dehydrogenation mechanism hence
against the latter proposal is that the simple exchange by Na
cations of a Ga/HMFI sample caused a decrease by more than
2 orders of magnitude (1/180) of the rate of propane dehydro-
genation [136].
Fig. 10 shows the mechanism of dehydrogenation proposed
by M´
eriaudeau and Naccache [136]. The ﬁrst step is the het-
erolytic dissociation of propane with formation of Ga hydride
and Ga alkoxide species. Over pure gallium oxide these alkox-
ides would decompose into propene and H+ bonded to the
surface oxygen (step 2); the last step would be the formation
of hydrogen from the H+, H−species with recovering of the Ga
sites. Step 2 would be the limiting step of this catalytic cycle. In
presence of the protonic sites at the proximity of the Ga active
sites, the propyl carbenium ions formed in step 1 will easily
exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migra-
tion (step 4). This new pathway allows one to bypass the limiting
step of propene formation over pure Ga oxide. A slightly differ-
ent mechanism was proposed by Buckles and Hutchings [150]:
propane would be activated at the interface between Ga oxide
and protonic sites; the initial process would be the polarization
of the C H bond by Ga oxide, the second one the cleavage of the
polarized C H bond by interaction with the protonic sites. Fur-
thermore, from propane 2-13C transformation followed by 13C
MAS NMR spectroscopy, Derouane et al. [151] conclude to the
participation as ﬁrst intermediate of a protonated pseudocyclo-
propane species formed by propane activation on a (Ga3+, O2−)
ion pair and its protonation by a nearby protonic acid site. Lastly,
according to Ono [4], the role of the protonic sites would be to
scavenge the Zn (or Ga) hydride species formed by heterolytic
dissociation of propane, e.g. [ZnH]+ + H+ →Zn2+ + H2.

Fig. 10. Ga–acid bifunctional mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over GaHMFI catalysts adapted from reference [135].
In the mechanism proposed by Biscardi and Iglesia [43], the
ﬁrst step is the activation of the C H bond over the protonic sites,
the role of the Ga species being to act as efﬁcient “portholes”
for the removal of the H atoms produced during the activation
step. To demonstrate this mechanism, reactions of C3H8/C3D8
mixtures were carried out over HMFI and Ga/HMFI catalysts
[43]. Both the roles of propane transformation and of C H bond
activation (cross exchange of D atoms between deuterated and
light propane molecules) can be determined from these experi-
ments. Over HMFI, the activation of the C H bond was found
to be much faster (35 times) than propane conversion. This
suggests that the protonic sites can activate C H bonds very
effectively but cannot dispose rapidly of the H atoms formed in
the C H bond scission. Therefore, these H atoms are used to
hydrogenate surface carbenium ions. Over Ga/HMFI, propane
transformation is 3-times faster than over HMFI, whereas the
C H bond activation occurs at similar rates over both cata-
lysts. To explain that, it was proposed that H atoms removal
could be achieved not only through H transfer to carbenium ions
but also by a re-combinative desorption involving Ga species.
Over pure HMFI hydride ions would be momentarily stabi-
lized by adsorption on Al atom sites, these unstable hydride
species reacting with carbenium ions to form alkane species
(Eq. (9) [140]):
(9)
Over Ga/HMFI, the hydride species stabilized by Ga ions
would combine with zeolite protons to form H2 (Eq. (10) [140]):
(10)
There are no deﬁnite arguments in favor of the a or of the
b mechanisms. It is furthermore likely that both mechanisms
could play a role in dehydrogenation steps over Ga/HMFI cata-
lysts. Whatever it will be, the bifunctional character of the sites
of Ga/HMFI catalysts which are active in dehydrogenation is
generally admitted.
However, Ga/MFI samples with Ga under the form of Ga+ in
exchange cations and which contains practically no protons were
shown to be active in alkane dehydrogenation. A mechanism was
proposed for this dehydrogenation on the basis of the results of
diffuse reﬂectance infra red spectroscopy (DRIFT) experiments
withethane[152].AfterheatingofGa/MFIinethaneatmosphere
at 250 ◦C, 4-weak stretching bands appear at 2882, 2914, 2939
and 2962 cm−1 which were ascribed to ethyl species grafted to
Ga+. Another band appears at 2057 cm−1 with a shoulder at
2040 cm−1 which corresponds to gallium hydride species. The
formation of these bands could be described by the following
reaction (Eq. (11)):
ZO−. . . Ga+ + C2H6 →ZO−. . . [Ga3+(H−)(C2H5−)]+
(11)
Prolonged heating resulted in the decomposition of the ethyl
species with appearance of new C H stretchings bands at 3024,
3055 and 3072 cm−1 typical of oleﬁn or aromatic hydrocarbons
and with a shift of the maximum of the Ga hydride band to
2040 cm−1 which indicates the formation of gallium dihydride
species as Eq. (12) shows [152].
ZO−. . . [Ga3+(H−)(C2H5−)]+
→ZO−. . . [Ga3+(H−)2]+ + C2H4
(12)
It should be remarked that in Eq. (11), there is an “alkyl”
activation of ethane (C2H5−) and not a “carbenium” acti-
vation (C2H5+) as proposed in the mechanism advanced by
M´
eriaudeau and Naccache [136]. Quantum chemical calcula-
tions were undertaken to discriminate between these two possi-
bilities and also to specify the nature of the active Ga species:
dihydride gallium ion (GaH2)+Z−or gallyl ion (Ga O)+Z−
[153]. The conclusions were that (GaH2)+Z−was the likely
active species and that alkane activation occurred via an “alkyl”
mechanism involving three successive steps: scission of a C H
bond (1), formation of dihydrogen from the proton and the
hydrogen bound to Ga (2) and formation of ethane from the
ethyl group bound to Ga [153]. Ethane dehydrogenation over
G. Caeiro et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 255 (2006) 131–158
147
dihydride gallium ions was recently reconsidered [154], the con-
clusion being that a one step concerted mechanism was more
likely than the three step mechanism proposed by Frash and van
Santen [153].
These conclusions on the mode of ethane activation and on
the active sites were recently disputed by Joshi and Thomson
[155] from a density functional theory (DFT) pathway analy-
sis. Two types of sites were considered: the mono Al site of
the form Z−[GaH2]2+ (dihydride gallium ion) and a di-Al site:
Z2−[GaH2]2+. With the ﬁrst type of sites the calculated activa-
tion energies were too high compared to experimental values,
which leads the authors to conclude that the sites were not likely
responsible for alkane dehydrogenation. [GaH]2+ species resid-
ing near di-Al sites were proposed to be the active sites. They
can be reduced by hydrogen with formation of protonic acid
sites (Eq. (13)):
[GaH]2+ + H2 →[GaH2]+ + H+
(13)
This reaction being endothermic, [GaH]2+ species are pre-
dominant at low temperature. However, both species could be
present under normal reaction conditions. A carbenium acti-
vation mechanism consisting of three distinct steps: activation
of the C H bond with formation of an alkoxide like inter-
mediate (1), desorption of ethene (2) and then of molecular
hydrogen was proposed. There is an optimal Al–Al distance
due to opposite effects on the activation barrier for C H activa-
tion and for H2 removal [155]. However, an argument against
this proposal of a di-Al route is the low probability of ﬁnding Al
pairs in the high Si/Al MFI zeolites which are generally used in
aromatization.
3.1.4. Composition of the working catalyst
The bifunctional character of the alkane transformation pro-
cess on Ga/HMFI catalysts and of the dehydrogenating acid
sites was shown in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.3, respectively. The
proposals of the literature on the composition of the Ga/HMFI
catalysts under the operating conditions are presented here, the
focus being made on the nature of the Ga species.
Gallium can be introduced into Ga/HMFI catalysts through
different ways: impregnation with various salts, ion exchange,
chemical vapor desorption, mechanical mixtures of Ga2O3 and
HMFI, synthesis of MFI gallosilicates, etc. Whatever the mode
of introduction, Ga can have a beneﬁcial effect on the rate and
selectivity of alkane aromatization. All these modes of introduc-
tion yield practically always the same type of Ga species after
calcination. Thus, impregnation and ion exchange of HMFI lead
to the preferential deposition of mostly GaO(OH) species on
the outer surface of zeolite crystallites [156] for hydrated Ga3+
cations are too bulky to enter the channels of HMFI [157]; during
calcination, these extracrystalline Ga species convert to Ga2O3
crystals [142,144,156,158]. Furthermore the calcination of the
gallosilicates at high temperatures (>700 ◦C) causes the degal-
liation of the framework and the formation of extraframework
Ga species which deposit on the outer surface of the crystals or
within the mesopores under the form of Ga2O3 [5,159,160].
The extraframework species were shown to be at least 150-
times more active than the tetrahedral framework Ga species.
A complete inactivity of the tetrahedral Ga species has even
been suggested [159].
Therefore, after calcination, most of the synthesized
Ga/HMFI catalysts can be considered as mixtures of Ga2O3
and HMFI. However, these mixtures are not the real arom-
atization catalysts for signiﬁcant changes in the nature and
location of the Ga species as well as in the zeolite acidity
were shown to occur during pretreatment with hydrogen or dur-
ing propane aromatization (because of hydrogen production) at
500 ◦C. These changes can have a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect
on the aromatization activity and selectivity. However, the inti-
macy of Ga2O3 and HMFI is of paramount importance. Thus,
with catalysts prepared by gentle mixture of Ga2O3 and HMFI
the increase in activity is not substantial [150], whereas with
highly intimate mixtures a signiﬁcant increase can be observed
[161].
The origin of this increase was ﬁrst investigated by Kanizarev,
Price and colleagues using gravimetric, DRX and FT-IR tech-
niques [143–145,158,161,162]. Reduction was shown to occur
during hydrogen treatment at high temperatures by a sequence of
stepsinvolvingtheformationofGa2Ospecieswhichcanmigrate
into the zeolite channels and undergo solid-state exchange with
the zeolite protonic sites (Eqs. (14) and (15)).
Ga2O3 + 2H2 →Ga2O + 2H2O
(14)
Ga2O + 2H+Z−→2Ga+Z−+ H2O
(15)
This reduction was conﬁrmed by the shift in Ga K-edge
energy to lower values detected by in situ X-ray absorption
measurements [142]. These measurements also shown that the
reduced Ga species consisted of monomeric Ga0 or Ga+ com-
pounds and that the reoxidation of reduced species to Ga3+
species occurred upon cooling to room temperature even in H2
or propane [161]. Therefore, the active form of Ga species can
be detected only at reaction conditions. Biscardi and Iglesia [43]
suggest that the neutral [GaOH] species stabilized by interaction
withbasicoxygenswithinMFIchannelsarethesteadystateform
of reduced Ga (Eq. (16)).
(16)
In agreement with reaction (15), H2 treatment at high temper-
atures of Ga/HMFI samples causes a very signiﬁcant decrease
in the intensity of the bridging OH band at 3610 cm−1 [185].
However, a more limited decrease in the activity for model
acidic reactions was observed: decrease by 1.5-times of the
activity for m-xylene isomerization, by 1.4–2 times of that for
propane transformation into methane [131,132] and by 1.4–1.6
times of the activity for 2-methyl-2-pentene isomerization [43].
This discrepancy could be due to reoxidation of reduced Ga
148

species upon cooling of the catalyst to room temperature for IR
measurements.
However, this reoxidation cannot occur when all the protonic
sites are exchanged by Ga+ [127]. The corresponding Ga/MFI
catalyst which has no measurable protonic acidity has a low
activity for propane aromatization. Contrary to what is often
observed over Ga/HMFI catalysts, aromatics are secondarily
formed, which means that aromatization is limited by propene
transformation (and not by propane dehydrogenation). A mono-
functional mechanism was proposed to explain this aromatiza-
tion in the apparent absence of protonic sites [127]. It could
however be noted that an undetectable amount of protonic sites
could be responsible for the very facile (at the high reaction
temperatures) oligomerization and cyclization steps involved in
bifunctional aromatization.
More recently, a DRIFT study of the nature of gallium species
in GaMFI samples prepared by incipient wetness impregna-
tion or via anchoring of trimethylgallium was carried out [152].
Reduction of the samples in hydrogen and evacuation at high
temperature resulted in quantitative replacement of the protonic
sites by Ga+ ions. Ga+ ions were shown to be partially oxidized
by water at 300 ◦C with release of H2. After evacuation at 300 ◦C
and cooling to room temperature a partial regeneration of pro-
tonic sites was also observed (regeneration of the bridging OH
band at 3610 cm−1). The following reactions (Eqs. (17)–(19)
were proposed to explain these observations:
ZO−Ga+ + H2O →ZO−. . . [Ga3+(OH−)(H−)]+
(17)
ZO−. . . [Ga3+(OH−)(H−)]+ + H2O
→ZO−. . . [Ga3+(OH−)2]+ + H2
(18)
ZO−. . . [Ga3+(OH−)2]+ →ZO−. . . H+ + GaOOH
(19)
Oxidative addition of hydrogen to Ga+ at 500 ◦C resulted in
the formation of stable gallium dihydride species. However, the
authors conclude [152] that under typical aromatization condi-
tions monovalent Ga+ species are predominant even if (GaH2)+
species are also present. These species would be the active
species able through an oxidative process to dissociate ethane
into C2H5−and H−species as was the case for H2.
3.1.5. Comparison of Zn and of Ga/MFI catalysts
The aromatization of small alkanes was also investigated over
MFI zeolites doped with various other agents: Pt [82,163–166],
Zn [167–179], Cu [180], Ag [4], Ge [181], Re [182], Mo [183],
Te [140]. A particular attention was placed on Zn/HMFI cata-
lysts both from a fundamental and an applied point of view.
Depending on the authors and on the alkane reactant,
Zn/HMFI catalysts were found more, or less performant (active
and selective) in aromatization than Ga/HMFI catalysts. Note
however that under the severe conditions of alkane aromatisa-
tion, Zn0 can be formed by reduction with H2 or hydrocarbons
and eluted from the catalyst, which constitutes a serious draw-
back for the industrial use of Zn/HMFI catalysts [184].
Like with Ga/HMFI catalysts, it seems clear that aromatiza-
tion of small alkanes occur through the bifunctional catalysis
pathway presented in Fig. 9 which involves successively dehy-
drogenating steps (steps 1, 5, 9 and 10) over Zn-containing
species and oligomerization (step 3) and cyclization (step 7)
steps over the protonic zeolite sites. Also like with Ga/HMFI
catalysts, despite signiﬁcant advances, the nature of the dehy-
drogenating species and the dehydrogenation mechanism are not
perfectly established.
Like Ga/HMFI catalysts, Zn/HMFI catalysts can be prepared
by various ways: ion exchange, impregnation, mechanical mix-
ture of ZnO and of the zeolite [4], deposition of Zn vapor
[177,178]. Different types of Zn species can be obtained. Thus,
by impregnation of a HMFI zeolite (Si/Al = 35) with an aque-
ous solution of Zn (NO3)2, drying then calcination at 550 ◦C for
12h, the resulting Zn/HMFI sample (8 wt.% Zn) was shown by
CO adsorption to contain large ZnO crystals likely on the exter-
nal surface, small ZnO clusters inside the micropores and Zn
cations. Despite the large amount of Zn in the sample only part
of the bridging OH groups were found to be exchanged [179].
In contrast, zinc vapor deposition at 500 ◦C can lead to a com-
plete exchange of the zeolite protonic sites [178]. This difference
seems to have consequences on alkane activation, this activation
occurring essentially on the ZnO species with the ﬁrst type of
sample (8 wt.% Zn impregnated HMFI) [179] and on acid–base
pairs (exchanged Zn2+cations-framework oxygen atoms) with
the second [178].
Large differences were shown between the modes of ethane
activation over Ga+ and Zn2+ in exchange position in MFI sam-
ples (without protonic sites) deduced from diffuse reﬂectance
infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) experiments. The mode of acti-
vation over Ga+ has been described above: at relatively high
temperature (250 ◦C), ethane activation would occur via oxida-
tive addition with formation of ethyl and hydride fragments
grafted to gallium (Eq. (11)) which decompose under prolonged
heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides (Eq. (12)). In the
Zn/MFI samples, the positive charge of the Zn2+ cations is only
partially compensated, hence these cations can be considered as
Lewis superacids. At room temperature, ethane adsorbed over
Zn2+ as shown in particular by the appearance of a band at
2738 cm−1. Heating at 150 ◦C in an ethane atmosphere caused a
decrease in the intensity of this band and a partial regeneration of
the band corresponding to bridging OH groups (at 3610 cm−1).
After ethane evacuation at room temperature, three new bands in
the region of the C H stretching vibrations were visible. Heating
at 250 ◦C led to the appearance of a band at 1934 cm−1 ascribed
to zinc hydride. The following scheme was proposed to account
for these observations (Eqs. (20)–(22)).
ZO−. . . Zn2+ + ZO−+ C2H6 →ZO−. . . Zn2+ −C2H6 + ZO−
(20)
ZO−. . . Zn2+ −C2H6 + ZO−
→ZO−. . . Zn2+ −C2H5−+ ZO−H+
(21)
ZO−. . . Zn2+ −C2H5−+ ZO−H+
→ZO−. . . Zn2+. . . H−+ C2H4 + ZO−H+
(22)

149
As a consequence of the regeneration of protonic acid sites,
ethane aromatization took place over Zn/MFI, whereas only
ethene formation occurred on Ga/MFI [178].
3.1.6. Conclusion
The commercial interest of LPG aromatization is well
demonstrated with the development of several processes. The
major interest of these processes is to allow the conversion of
low value gaseous alkanes produced in remote ﬁelds into valu-
able and easier to be transported benzenic hydrocarbons.
The bifunctional character of the aromatization pathway with
successive intervention of species containing Ga, Zn, etc. for
dehydrogenation steps and of acidic protonic sites for oligomer-
ization and cyclization steps is now well admitted. In contrast,
despite the large number of studies devoted to aromatization
(∼500 papers) leaning on a large variety of techniques including
the most advanced ones, both the exact nature of the dehydro-
genating species and the dehydrogenation mechanism are not
perfectly clariﬁed. This is essentially due to the large differ-
ences in composition of the Ga (or Zn/MFI) samples which
were used in the investigations: presence of different Ga (or Zn)
species with different adsorption and catalytic properties, very
low (∼zero) to high concentration of protonic sites, etc., as well
as to the signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of the catalysts which occur
frequentlyunderpre-treatmentandreactionconditions.Thevery
systematic approach with use of model catalysts with perfectly
speciﬁedphysicochemicalcharacteristicswhichisnowfollowed
should lead in the near future to a thorough understanding of this
complex catalytic system.
3.2. n-Butane hydroisomerization and
dehydroisomerization
Both types of reactions present a large commercial inter-
est. The ﬁrst one is already used to produce isobutane which
is employed such as for the production of a high octane gasoline
cut by aliphatic alkylation or is dehydrogenated into isobutene
which has various applications: production of polymers, of
methyltertiobutylether (MTBE), etc. [8]. The second one which
combines in the same operation n-butane dehydrogenation with
n-butene isomerization (one pot two-step reaction) constitutes
a commercially (and conceptually) interesting alternative for
isobutene synthesis [12].
3.2.1. Hydroisomerization of n-butane
It is well known that the stability of acidic zeolites can be sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced by noble metals such as Pt (or Pd), provided
however that the reaction is carried out under hydrogen. Pt can
play two roles depending on the strength of the acidic sites and
on the reaction temperature [8,130,186]:
- When the acidity is strong enough so that the catalyst is
active at low temperatures (e.g. highly chlorinated alumina,
≥150 ◦C), the only role of Pt is to enhance the stability by
activating hydrogen; the activated hydrogen reacts with car-
benium ions limiting their concentration, hence, the forma-
tion of carbonaceous compounds responsible for deactivation
[8,130,186].
- When, because of the too weak acidity of the catalyst, the
reaction has to be carried out at high temperatures (e.g.
silica–alumina, >350 ◦C), Pt additives play two roles: stabi-
lization of the activity like with the strongly acidic catalysts
but also development of a predominant bifunctional pathway
involving successive chemical and diffusion steps, e.g. in n-
alkane hydroisomerization: dehydrogenation of n-alkane into
the corresponding alkenes over Pt sites, diffusion of these
alkenes from the Pt to the protonic sites, isomerization of
these alkenes into isoalkenes, diffusion of isoalkenes from the
protonic sites to the Pt sites and then hydrogenation of these
isoalkenes into isoalkanes [126]. As the reaction is carried
out under hydrogen, oleﬁnic intermediates are present in very
low amounts [8,126,130]. This bifunctional scheme does not
appear over the strongly acidic catalysts because ﬁrstly the
acidic reaction is fast and secondly the amount of oleﬁnic
intermediates is too small at the low operating temperature.
- With sulphated zirconia and HMOR catalysts whose acid
strength is intermediate between those of chlorinated alumina
and silica–alumina, n-butane isomerization has to be carried
out at intermediate temperatures (250 ◦C) with possibility of
conjunct participation of purely acidic and bifunctional path-
ways [8].
It should be remarked that with both the acidic and bifunc-
tional mechanisms, the reaction order with respect to hydrogen
will be negative, the increase in hydrogen pressure causing
a decrease in the concentration of carbenium ion transition
states.
A detailed comparison of n-butane transformation over
HMOR and Pt/HMOR catalysts was reported in references
[187,188]. Under hydrogen at 250 ◦C, Pt causes a signiﬁcant
improvementinstabilitybutaveryimportantdecreaseinactivity
especially for the formation of isobutane and pentanes; more-
over, hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane, etc.) appear in
large amounts. Operating at higher temperatures causes, in addi-
tion to the expected increase in activity, a signiﬁcant increase in
the selectivity to isobutane. However, at these high temperatures
(>350 ◦C), n-butane isomerization occurs most likely through
the bifunctional pathway. Indeed the apparent activation energy
is much higher than for an acid mechanism: 90–110 kJ mol−1
[75]against35–40 kJ mol−1 onchlorinatedalumina[8].Further-
more, there are no deﬁnite arguments in the literature in favour
of a bimolecular or of a monomolecular mode of n-butane iso-
merization.
Mesopores were shown to have a positive effect on the
selectivity to isobutane of bifunctional Pd mordenite catalysts
[189,190]. The location of the noble metals plays a signiﬁcant
role. As the introduction through ion exchange could lead to
a partial blockage of the HMOR channels, the best method of
catalyst preparation seems to be through intimate physical mix-
ing of the acidic component (HMOR) and of Pt or Pd dispersed
on a support such as montmorillonite (the so-called hybrid cata-
lysts). Compared to supported Pd/HMOR, hybrid catalysts were
shown to be more selective to isobutane, an additional advantage
for their industrial use being their mechanical resistance against
attrition [191].

G. Caeiro et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 255 (2006) 131–158
n-Butane transformation was also investigated on Pd or Pt
supported on other acidic zeolites: HMFI [189,192–194], HBEA
[193], HTON [74] and HFER [74], but generally at temperatures
≥350 ◦C. Whatever the zeolite component, a high selectivity to
isobutane (60–90%) can be obtained but only at relatively low
conversions (<30%). However, at these operating temperatures,
the percentage at thermodynamic equilibrium of isobutane in
the n-butane/isobutane mixture is lower than 40%, which makes
non-economical the industrial development of these catalysts.
Liu et al. [195] questioned the low activity of HMOR com-
pared to sulphated zirconia catalysts which have nevertheless
similar acid strength. According to these authors this difference
would be due to the geometrical constraints exerted by the one-
dimensional channels in MOR on the dimerization step of the
bimolecular mechanism.
3.2.2. Dehydroisomerization of n-butane
Two different concepts have been followed to transform in the
same reactor n-butane into isobutene: use of either two different
catalysts in successive beds, the ﬁrst one active in dehydrogena-
tion the second one in butene isomerization or of a bifunctional
systemconstitutedofonlyonecatalystorresultingfromphysical
mixture of two catalysts with dehydrogenation and isomeriza-
tion functions.
An example of the two-bed system is the one presented by
Bellussi et al. [196]: the ﬁrst bed is constituted of a Pt/silylated
alumina promoted with In and Sn (n-butane dehydrogenation)
the second one of Boralite (butene isomerization). In another
example, Pd/HMFI was used in the ﬁrst bed, HMCM22 in the
second [197].
The bifunctional systems which were tested contained gen-
erally zeolites. It is the case for the mixture of dehydrogenating
and isomerization components, e.g. Cr2O3 + MFI metallosili-
cates [198], Zn/K-HMFI + TON [199] as well as for the purely
bifunctional catalysts, essentially Pt (alone or associated with
Mn, Cu, Sn) supported on large pore zeolites: MOR [200], FAU
[201]; average pore zeolites: MEL [202], MFI [12,203,204],
FER [204], TON [204,205], MWW [197] or on aluminophos-
phates [206]. n-Butane dehydroisomerization was also investi-
gated over Ga/SAPO11 [207].
Eqs. (23) and (24) show that dehydroisomerization is a com-
bination of an endothermic reaction (dehydrogenation) hence
thermodynamically favoured at high temperatures and of a
slightly exothermic reaction (butene isomerization) favoured at
low temperatures.

Both equilibria limit the maximum yield in isobutene. More-
over, an additional reaction, the dehydrogenation of butene into
butadiene which is a precursor of coke has to be considered for
choosing the operating conditions [12]. Thus, hydrogen has to be

added to the feed in order to limit deactivation by coking, which
for a thermodynamic point of view is detrimental for butene for-
mation. For the same reason, the operating temperature will be
chosen low enough to limit butadiene formation, hence as shown
in Fig. 11, it will be lower than the temperature corresponding
to the maximum yield in isobutene [12].
3.2.2.1. Reaction scheme. The reaction scheme of n-butane
dehydroisomerization was established over Pt/HMFI with
high Si/Al ratios hence with low acid site concentrations,
under the following conditions: 560 ◦C, pH2 = 0.36 bar, pn-
butane = 0.18 bar [12]. Under these conditions, deactivation is
relatively fast: decrease in activity of ∼30% in 2.5 h. In addi-
tion to n-butene and isobutene, various by-products can be
observed: methane, ethene, ethane, propene, propane, isobu-
tane and pentenes. Butenes resulting from butane dehydrogena-
tion were the main primary products (<95%). Furthermore,
as shown by comparing the products obtained over Pt/HMFI
and HMFI, butane undergoes two other primary reactions: pro-
tolytic cracking into methane + propene and ethane + ethene
over the acidic sites of the zeolite and hydrogenolysis into
methane, ethane and propane over the Pt sites. Whereas
the ﬁrst one plays always a minor role, the contribution of
hydrogenolysis increases at high conversion when n-butane con-
sumption through dehydrogenation approaches thermodynamic
equilibrium.
n-Butene undergoes secondary reactions, in particular the
formation of isobutene, propene and pentenes, which sug-
gests n-butene transformation through an oligomerization–
isomerization–cracking mechanism. Note again that this type
of process leads always in parallel to propene + pentenes and
to isobutene. The propene/pentenes molar ratio is much higher
than 1 suggesting that oligomer intermediates are not only
dimers. At the high reaction temperature these oligomers are
very unfavored at thermodynamic equilibrium, hence cannot
be observed in the reaction products. In addition to ethene,
propene, isobutene, pentenes, the corresponding alkanes are also
formed. The alkane/alkene ratio (ethane/ethene, etc.) increases

with n-butane conversion, which indicates that alkanes result
from alkene hydrogenation.
The reaction scheme of n-butane transformation over
Pt/HMFI is represented in Fig. 12. As it was also demon-
strated over (Pt/Cu)HTON catalysts [205], isobutene results
from a bifunctional pathway involving successively butane
dehydrogenation over the Pt sites then n-butene isomerization
over the protonic sites. The alternative bifunctional scheme
involving successively butane isomerization then isobutane
dehydrogenation can be excluded. Indeed butenes which appear
as primary products are much more reactive than isobutane
which moreover is secondarily formed in relatively low
amounts.
3.2.2.2. Inﬂuence of catalytic characteristics and operating
conditions. The balance between hydrogenating and acid func-
tions of Pt zeolite catalysts used in classical bifunctional reac-
tions such as hydroisomerization and hydrocracking is known
to determine for a large part the catalyst properties. This balance
generally expressed as the ratio between the concentrations of
accessible Pt and protonic sites (nPt/nA) [208] was used by Pirn-
gruber et al. [12] in the case of butane dehydroisomerization
over Pt/HMFI catalysts. Fig. 13a and b show that whatever n-
butane conversion, the higher nPt/nA, the higher the selectivity
to butenes (n + iso) and the lower the selectivity to the main
by-products (ethane, propene, propane and pentenes).
The highest yield of isobutene was obtained over the sample
with the highest value of nPt/nA (0.34) which contains 0.5 wt.%
Pt well dispersed on a Pt/HMFI sample with a Si/Al ratio of
240, hence with a very low concentration of protonic sites. This
yield is of ∼12%, the conversion of n-butane being of ∼64%;
n-butenes are practically in thermodynamic equilibrium with
n-butane but the approach of the n-butene/isobutene equilibrium
is of only 50%. A better approach of this equilibrium can be
obtained by operating at higher conversions or with more
acidic catalysts (lower nPt/nA ratios) but at the expense of the
selectivity to butenes (n + iso).
A kinetic study was carried out over the PtHMFI catalysts
[203]. The main conclusions are summarized below:
1. High temperature and low pressures reduce the formation
of by-products through the oligomerization–isomerization–
cracking pathway and the thermodynamic constraints of
dehydrogenation. However, above 560 ◦C these improve-
ments are overcompensated by a loss in catalyst stability
ascribed to poisoning of the Pt and acidic sites by butadiene

and by coke resulting from its transformation. The authors
account for the decrease in by-products by an increase of
the participation of the monomolecular mechanism in butene
isomerization. Another explanation could be the reduction in
size of oligomers to dimers which can lead selectively to
isobutene [209].
2. The increase in the H2/n-butane ratio causes an enhance-
ment of the non-desired hydrogenolysis reactions without
increasing signiﬁcantly the catalyst stability. The optimum
with respect to selectivity and stability was found for H2/n-
butane = 2.
As the main secondary products formed on Pt/HMFI result
from cracking of butene oligomers, other zeolites: HFER,
HTON, HMWW known as more selective than HMFI for n-
butene isomerization were chosen for n-butane dehydroisomer-
ization. Pt/HFER and Pt/HTON [204] were found to be less
selective to isobutene than Pt/HMFI because of a more sig-
niﬁcant contribution of protolytic cracking and hydrogenolysis
in the formation of secondary products. This low selectivity
could be partly due to the low dehydrogenating activity of
these Pt zeolites because of limitations to the access of small
Pt particles located in the narrow micropores (low value of the
nPt/nA ratio). In contrast, at low temperatures (up to 500 ◦C),
Pt/HMWW achieved higher yields of isobutene than Pt/HMFI
catalysts [197]. The distribution of by-products was very dif-
ferent with less cracking products and more isobutane (formed
by isobutene hydrogenation) than on Pt/HMFI. Unfortunately,
especially at high temperatures, Pt/HMWW catalysts are not
very stable, deactivation most likely by coking, affecting both
the dehydrogenating and acidic sites. Note that the two-bed
approach with the very efﬁcient zeolite catalysts for butene
isomerization (HFER, HMWW) in the second bed could be
attractive. Slightly better results than on PtHMFI catalysts were
furthermore obtained through this approach by using HMWW
in combination with PtHMFI in the ﬁrst bed acting mainly as a
dehydrogenating catalyst.
The selectivity of n-butane dehydroisomerization could also
be enhanced by limiting the secondary reaction of hydrogenol-
ysis. This can be made by the classical way, i.e., by substituting
bimetallic catalysts (Pt–Cu [205], Pt–In [201]) for Pt. Indeed
hydrogenolysis is well known to be a structure sensitive reaction
(i.e., which requires several adjacent Pt sites), which is not the
case for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions [210]. There-
fore, the reduction of the size of the Pt ensembles by dilution
with a second metal should cause an inhibition of hydrogenoly-
sis reactions and an increase in the dehydrogenation selectivity.
It is what was clearly observed by substituting Pt (supported on
HFAU) by Pt–Sn: increase in the selectivity to n-butenes and
isobutene at the expense of the selectivity to C1–C3 alkanes
[201].
n-Butane dehydroisomerization was also investigated over
bifunctional catalysts based on MnAPO11 [206] and SAPO11
[207] hence with weak acid sites. The best results were obtained
with Ga/SAPO11 at 500 ◦C with a dehydrogenation yield close
to the thermodynamic limit and an approach to equilibrium of
butene isomerization of ∼70%.
3.2.2.3. Conclusion. Butane
dehydroisomerization
was
demonstrated to occur over Pt/acid zeolites through two
successive reactions: n-butane dehydrogenation over Pt sites
then butene isomerization over protonic sites. The choice of
operation conditions is determined by severe thermodynamic
constraints: high temperatures are required for butane dehy-
drogenation into butenes but at too high temperatures (and
too low hydrogen/n-butane ratio), butadiene which is a coke
maker molecule is formed in too large amounts. Moreover,
butene isomerization is thermodynamically favoured at low
temperatures. In addition to the operation conditions, the
balance between the hydrogenation and acid functions and
the pore structure of the zeolite are, as is it is generally the
case with bifunctional catalysts, the parameters determining
the yield in the desired product and the catalyst stability. Four
main types of secondary reactions can be observed: protolytic
cracking, hydrogenolysis on the Pt sites, cracking of butene
oligomers and isobutene hydrogenation. Whereas all these
reactions can be limited by optimizing the bifunctional catalyst
and the operating conditions, the use of a two-bed reactor,
the ﬁrst one with a dehydrogenating catalyst, the second one
with a selective butene isomerization catalyst seems to be the
best solution (more ﬂexibility, etc.) for a commercial process.
However, additional work has to be carried out to obtain higher
yields in isobutene (up to now of only ∼15%).
3.3. Alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes
Environment-friendly zeolite catalysts have largely replaced
Friedel Crafts catalysts in the commercially important processes
of ethylbenzene, ethyltoluenes and cumene synthesis through
benzene or toluene alkylation with ethene and propene. Since
these alkenes can be selectively produced by dehydrogenation, a
one pot alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes could be pos-
sibleoverbifunctionalzeolitecatalysts(Fig.14).Thispossibility
was explored over Pt or Pd and Ga H zeolites [13,14,211–222],
the best results being always obtained with the tri-dimensional
average pore size MFI zeolite. Large pore size zeolites such
as FAU and MOR and average pore size zeolites with microp-
ores smaller than those of MFI gave low conversion and/or poor
selectivity.
3.3.1. Thermodynamic considerations
Fig. 15a and b show the equilibrium conversion for the trans-
formation of an equimolar mixture of benzene and ethane or
propane into the desired products: ethylbenzene or cumene. In
the range of temperature chosen in the literature: 300–550 ◦C,
the equilibrium conversion into ethylbenzene and into cumene
increases from 11.5 to 26.7% and from 7.6 to 15.4%, respec-
tively. Of course operating with a higher alkane/benzene
molar ratio leads to higher equilibrium values. Thus, for
the ratio of 4 chosen in reference [211], the equilibrium
conversion into ethylbenzene increases from 22.7 to 44.8%
from 300 to 550 ◦C and the one into cumene from 15 to
29.4%. Fig. 15a and b report also the equilibrium conver-
sion for the formation of the main secondary products which
were observed: toluene in alkylation of benzene with ethane

and, propane and ethylbenzene in alkylation of benzene with

3.3.2. Alkylation over Pt or Pd/HMFI catalysts
The products expected from alkylation, i.e., ethylbenzene,
ethyltoluenes or cumene are formed over Pt or Pd/HMFI cata-
lysts. Under identical operating conditions, the activity of mix-
tures of Pt/non-acidic support and HMFI is much higher than
those of the components, as could be expected from a bifunc-
tional mechanism [126,130]; Pt/HMFI catalysts on which Pt and
protonic sites are closer are more active than the physical mix-
ture in which alkylation is likely limited by the migration step
of alkene intermediates from the Pt sites to the acidic sites (step
M in Fig. 14).
In toluene alkylation with ethane, the optimum yield to ethyl-
toluenes over a 0.9 wt.% Pd/HMFI(25) catalyst (Si/Al = 25) was
found at 350 ◦C and with an ethane/toluene molar ratio of 4
[211]. At higher temperatures and for ratios smaller than 4, the
selectivity to ethyltoluenes was lower, whereas at lower temper-
atures the activity was too low. A signiﬁcant initial decrease in
toluene conversion can be observed followed by a quasi plateau
in activity after 400 min time-on stream. The activity decrease
is essentially due to the disappearance of the products of toluene
disproportionation (benzene and xylenes) over the zeolite acid
sites with therefore a signiﬁcant increase of the selectivity to
ethyltoluenes: from 25 to 80% and practically no change in the
yield in ethyltoluenes. It should be remarked that under the oper-
ating conditions no ethene was observed in the reaction products,
which suggests that ethyltoluene formation was kinetically lim-
ited by ethane dehydrogenation (step D in Fig. 14).
In contrast, a large amount of ethene (∼twice the one of ethyl-
benzene) was observed in the products of benzene alkylation
with ethane at 500 ◦C, ethane/benzene molar ratio of 5 over
a Pt/HMFI catalyst with a very large amount of Pt (6.8 wt.%)
[13,213]. Therefore, the alkylation (step A in Fig. 15) could be
the limiting step of the bifunctional scheme. However, as the
rate of ethylbenzene formation is practically independent on the
Si/Al ratio of the HMFI zeolite, hence on the acid site concen-
tration, that cannot be the case. Thermodynamic equilibrium of
the A step which is largely in favour of dealkylation at the high
reaction temperature could be responsible for this large amount
of ethene in the products.
The maximum yields in ethylbenzene and ethyltoluenes
which were reported in these preliminary experiments are not
very high: 7.3 and 1.4 wt.% based on benzene and toluene
respectively, which corresponds to ∼40% of the equilibrium
value. Note also that while the paper on toluene ethylation is
well documented with respect to selectivity and stability [211],

nothing is said on these essential features in the case of benzene
ethylation [213].
Benzene alkylation with propane over 0.2–0.3 wt.% Pt/HMFI
at 350 ◦C [14] leads to a larger diversity of products (Table 3)
than toluene ethylation. Indeed, over Pt/HMFI samples with
Si/Al ratios of 150, 50 and 25 and a propane/benzene ratio of
1, there is in addition to the expected propylbenzene products
(cumene IPB and n-propylbenzene NPB) formation of toluene,
ethylbenzene, C9–C11 alkylbenzenes, methane, ethane, C4–C5
hydrocarbons. Propene can also be observed, the selectivity
to this product decreasing with the zeolite Si/Al ratio, hence
with the increase in acid site concentration: from 13.6% for
Si/Al = 150 to 0.35% for Si/Al = 25 (Table 3). Propane conver-
sion increases with decreasing Si/Al: 6.6% for Si/Al = 150 to
44.6% for Si/Al = 25 (Table 3). It is almost proportional to the
acid site concentration, which suggests that the limiting step
of propane transformation (and product formation) is catalyzed
by the zeolite protonic sites. A signiﬁcant change in the prod-
uct distribution can also be observed with a signiﬁcant decrease
with the Si/Al ratio in propylbenzenes at the beneﬁt of toluene,
methane, ethane and C4–C5; however, this change in selectivity
seems to be more related to the increase in conversion (hence
in the secondary transformations of propylbenzenes) than to the
increase in the acid site density. It should be noticed that the
same products were formed but much more slowly on the pure
HMFI samples. The addition to Pt/HMFI of an H2 scavenger (a
Zr2Fe intermetallic compound) to shift the thermodynamic equi-
librium of benzene alkylation with propane causes an increase in
propane conversion but no signiﬁcant change in the product dis-
tribution. The highest propylbenzene production was obtained
with the association of Pt/HMFI(150) and Zr2Fe: yield of 8.5%
with a selectivity of ∼60% (Table 3) and with a good catalyst
stability(however,limitedbythesaturationoftheH2 scavenger).
The product distribution and its change with the character-
istics of the catalyst can be explained by the scheme presented
in Fig. 16. Benzene adsorbs on the protonic sites of the zeo-
lite with formation of benzenium ions. Hydride transfer to these
cations leads to cyclohexadiene and isopropyl carbenium ions
(step 1). These cations can also result from two other ways:
Fig. 16. Steps involved in benzene alkylation with propane over bifunctional
M/HMFI catalysts. M = Pt, Pd, Ga, etc. Step 1: hydride transfer from propane
molecules to benzenium ions; step 2: protolytic dehydrogenation (a) or cracking
(b, c); step 3: propane dehydrogenation on the metal sites. The other steps deal
with purely acidic transformations: benzene alkylation into cumene, ethylben-
zene and toluene, bimolecular isomerization of cumene into n-propylbenzene
or disproportionation into toluene + ethylbenzene and topropene and with the
bifunctional aromatization of propene.
protolytic dehydrogenation of propane (step 2a) and protona-
tion of propene resulting from propane dehydrogenation over
the Pt sites (step 3). The isopropyl carbenium ions can either
alkylate benzene into cumene or be transformed into aromat-
ics. Propane can also undergo protolytic cracking (steps 2b and
c) leading to ethane or methane plus methyl or ethyl carbe-
nium ions which alkylate benzene into toluene or ethylbenzene.
Toluene and ethylbenzene could also result from cracking of the
diphenyl propane intermediates of cumene isomerization into
n-propylbenzene. It should be emphasized that cumene forma-
tion is thermodynamically limited, hence that the reverse step
(dealkylation) can play a signiﬁcant role at high propane conver-
sion, with formation of a signiﬁcant amount of propene which
can be transformed into benzenic hydrocarbons.
3.3.3. Alkylation over Ga/HMFI catalysts
Alkylation of benzene with propane was also investigated
over Ga/HMFI catalysts, the reaction being carried out under
static conditions using 13C-NMR [218,219] or FT-IR [220] to
specify the reaction mechanisms or under more realistic ﬂow
conditions [221,222]. In the initial stage of the reaction, major
resonances corresponding to toluene, ethylbenzene, ethane and
methane with weak resonances assigned to cyclohexadiene,
cumene and n-propylbenzene are shown in 13C-NMR spec-
tra [218]. Afterwards, the lines corresponding to cyclohexa-
diene and cumene disappear then those of ethylbenzene and
n-propylbenzene, whereas those corresponding to toluene and

155
methane become predominant. Experiments were also carried
out with cumene in presence of benzene in order to conﬁrm
the possible formation of toluene and ethylbenzene from the
diphenyl propane intermediates of cumene isomerization [218].
The results obtained lead the authors to consider this mode
of formation as minor and to propose that toluene and ethyl-
benzene result essentially from direct benzene alkylation with
methyl and ethyl carbenium ions. The same conclusion was
advanced to explain the signiﬁcant formation of toluene and
ethylbenzene observed in ﬂow reactor over a Ga/HMFI cata-
lyst [222]. However, it should be remarked that this conclusion
is not in agreement with the well-known much higher selec-
tivity of Ga/HMFI for dehydrogenation compared to cracking
[131]. Therefore, it is most likely that a large part of toluene,
ethylbenzene and other aromatics result simply from propene
aromatization. The apparent secondary transformation of propy-
lbenzenes would be thus due to their dealkylation followed by
propene aromatization.
3.3.4. Conclusion
Alkylation of benzene (or toluene) with ethane and propane
was shown to be feasible in one apparent step using Pt, Pd and
Ga/HMFI catalysts. A reaction scheme was proposed to account
for the formation of the desired products: ethylbenzene, cumene,
etc. and of secondary products formed in large amounts, espe-
cially in alkylation with propane. These secondary reactions as
well as the severe thermodynamic constraints have a very nega-
tive effect on the production of the desired products. However,
the two-bed reactor system with the ﬁrst bed constituted by a
non-acidic selective dehydrogenation catalyst, the second one
by an alkylation catalyst could bring, like in n-butane dehydroi-
somerization, a signiﬁcant improvement.
4. General conclusion
This review paper, although limited to non-oxidative trans-
formations of C2–C4 alkanes on zeolite catalysts, demonstrates
the large interest of the scientiﬁc community for the great chal-
lenge that constitutes the substitution of these cheap and readily
available hydrocarbons for the very reactive but expansive light
alkenes. The most signiﬁcant advances of the last decade deal
with the fundamental aspects, the nature of the active sites and
their mode of action being now well clariﬁed:
1- Alkane activation on strong protonic sites of zeolites by pro-
tolytic dehydrogenation and cracking is now well-admitted,
even if some observations are not completely understood.
2- The composition of the carbonaceous deposits (“coke”)
responsible for the deactivation of zeolite catalysts used in
isobutane–butene alkylation was established. This allowed
the development of milder modes for “coke” removal, which
has as beneﬁt a complete restoration of the initial activity of
the not very stable catalysts.
3- The bifunctional character of the aromatization pathway with
successive intervention of species containing Ga for dehy-
drogenation steps and of acidic sites for oligomerisation and
cyclisation steps is now well admitted. The dehydrogenation
steps involve bifunctional sites associating neighbouring Ga
species (most likely Ga+) and protonic sites.
4- Onepottwo-steptransformationsintovaluableproductssuch
as isobutene and alkylbenzenes were shown to be feasible
over bifunctional zeolite catalysts. Thus, alkylation of ben-
zenic hydrocarbons with light alkanes occurs in one apparent
step over bifunctional Pt, Pd and Ga/HMFI catalysts. Fur-
thermore, n-butane dehydroisomerisation was demonstrated
to occur through n-butane dehydrogenation over Pt sites fol-
lowed by isomerisation of n-butene into isobutene over the
zeolite acid sites. In both cases the main problem to solve
deals with the too low selectivity to the desired products.
Some of the fundamental advances could open the route to
the development of new and greener commercial processes.
Processes have already been developed for LPG aromatisation.
These processes present a large interest for the conversion of the
low value light alkanes produced in remote ﬁelds into valuable
and easier to be transported BTX hydrocarbons and into hydro-
gen which can be used on site. The signiﬁcant advances made in
isobutane–butene alkylation both in the lifetime of zeolite cata-
lysts and in their regeneration could lead to the substitution of
sulphuric and hydroﬂuoric acids by these environment-friendly
catalysts. Lastly, the preliminary experiments which were car-
ried out show that bifunctional zeolite catalysts can catalyse,
in one apparent step, alkane transformations which require two
successive steps, avoiding polluting and costly separation steps.
However, additional work is indispensable to make the catalysts
enough stable and selective for an industrial development.
