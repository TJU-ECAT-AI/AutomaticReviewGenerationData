Three types of hydrogen adsorption have previously been characterized 
on zinc oxide at 
low temperatures, 
designated Types 1, 11 and 111. One of these, Type 111, is a molecular 
form of adsorption 
which can be specifically titrated by nitrogen adsorption on IO-20% 
of 
the surface with formation of a molecular nitrogen species. This selective titration by a 
molecular nitrogen adsorption was employed to study the participation 
of molecularly 
ad- 
sorbed hydrogen in the allotropic 
(ortho-para) 
hydrogen conversion and isotopic (HZ-D,) 
hydrogen exchange. The promotional 
effect of oxygen on the conversion reaction was also 
investigated. These results at low temperatures clearly indicate that the conversion reaction 
proceeds predominantly 
by a molecular paramagnetic 
mechanism involving this type 111 
hydrogen below 
140°K. while the exchange reaction proceeds via a Bonhoeffer-Farkas 
mechanism involving type 1 hydrogen at both low temperature 
and also at room tempera- 
ture. At low temperatures, the exchange and conversion reactions are independent, but this 
is not necessarily true at room temperature. 
A mathematical 
model is presented for the 
paramagnetic 
conversion based on Wigner’s theory involving longer times of interaction. 
The result is an enhancement of the conversion rate by several orders of magnitude with the 
deuterium conversion being enhanced more than the molecular hydrogen conversion. 
INTRODUCTION 
Heterogeneous 
catalysts 
that are effec- 
tive 
for hydrogenation 
reactions 
usually 
are also effective for isotopic exchange and 
allotropic 
(ortho-para) 
conversion 
of hy- 
drogen (1,2). The exact nature of the “ac- 
tivated” 
hydrogen 
in these sequences has 
been the subject of much speculation 
(3,4). 
Bonhoeffer 
and Farkas (5) originally 
pro- 
posed a dissociative 
mechanism 
to explain 
both the allotropic 
conversion 
as well as 
isotopic 
exchange. 
During 
hydrogenation 
the atomic 
hydrogen 
would undergo 
step- 
wise addition 
to adsorbed 
olefins to form 
the product 
alkanes. 
Although 
the model 
of the “active” 
hydrogen 
involving 
only an 
atomic 
adsorbed 
species can account for 
many 
features 
of the hydrogenation 
and 
exchange 
reactions, 
there are some defi- 
ciencies in this view. This model was mod-

in 1973. 
ified by Rideal 
(6) [and later Eley (4)] to 
account for these deficiencies. 
In the pro- 
posed sequence 
it is assumed 
that ex- 
change and conversion 
occur via reaction 
of the adsorbed 
atomic 
hydrogen 
species 
with molecular 
hydrogen 
(or deuterium). 
Twigg (7) presented 
a parallel 
mechanism 
for hydrogenation 
involving 
the addition 
of 
molecular 
hydrogen to an adsorbed olefin. 
This form of molecular 
hydrogen 
is often 
assumed to be weakly adsorbed. Little 
evi- 
dence has been presented 
to distinguish 
conclusively 
between 
these two mecha- 
nisms for isotopic exchange. 
Wigner 
(8) 
as well 
as Kalckar 
and 
Teller 
(9), has proposed 
a theory for allo- 
tropic conversion 
by collision 
of hydrogen 
with a paramagnetic 
gas molecule. 
Farkas 
et al. (10-13) 
applied 
this theory 
to the 
heterogeneous 
catalytic 
exchange by para- 
magnetic 
sites on a catalytic 
surface. The 
interaction 
of hydrogen 
with a paramag- 
netic surface site and the resulting 
model 
of the molecule 
as a hindered 
rotor was

discussed by White and Lassettre (14) and 
later refined 
by King 
and Benson 
(15). 
This was used to explain 
the chromato- 
graphic 
separation 
of allotropic 
and iso- 
topic hydrogen. 
Recently, 
Van Cauwelaert 
and 
Hall 
(16,17) 
has investigated 
and 
suggested the possible modifications 
of the 
conversion 
theory by collision 
to include 
the hindered 
rotor model 
of hydrogen 
in- 
teraction 
with a resulting 
enhancement 
of 
the par-a-conversion 
rate. An attempt 
was 
made to investigate 
the validity 
of this 
combined 
mechanism. 
Although 
infrared 
studies provide 
con- 
vincing 
evidence for atomic 
adsorption 
of 
hydrogen 
on 
some 
metals 
(18,19) 
and 
oxides 
(20) 
evidence 
for 
chemisorbed 
molecular 
hydrogen 
is less certain. 
For 
years the strongest 
nonmechanistic 
evi- 
dence 
for 
chemisorbed 
molecular 
hy- 
drogen 
stemmed 
from 
measurements 
of 
the isosteric 
heats of adsorption 
(2) but 
more 
recently, 
studies 
of the chromato- 
graphic 
separation 
(17,22,23) 
of the iso- 
topes 
and allotropes 
of hydrogen 
have 
strongly 
supported 
this view. Moreover, 
the low temperature 
infrared 
spectra of 
Kokes ef al. (24-25) 
have provided 
direct 
evidence for the existence of chemisorbed 
molecular 
hydrogen on zinc oxide. 
Hydrogen 
adsorbs on zinc oxide in two 
forms (Types 
I and II) at room tempera- 
ture (26) and in a third form (Type 
III) 
at 
78°K (27). Type I hydrogen 
adsorbs rap- 
idly and reversibly 
to yield ZnH 
and OH 
bands in the ir at room temperature 
by dis- 
sociation on a limited 
number of zinc oxide 
pair sites (20,24). 
At room 
temperature, 
saturation, 
estimated 
by both 
isotherms 
and ir band intensities, 
is approached 
at 50 
mm pressure of hydrogen 
with a surface 
coverage of about 
10%. This 
adsorption 
exhibits a pronounced 
kinetic 
but no equi- 
librium 
isotope effect (28). As the tempera- 
ture is reduced to 78”K, these band inten- 
sities change very little. 
Type 1 hydrogen 
is also the reactive 
form for ethylene 
hy- 
drogenation. 
Ethylene 
inhibits 
isotopic 
ex- 
change and, in the hydrogenation 
reaction 
with hydrogen 
isotopes, 
their 
gas phase 
molecular 
identity 
is preserved on addition 
(29). 
Type 
II 
adsorption 
occurs rapidly 
ini- 
tially, 
but slowly in latter stages and con- 
tinues 
at an observable 
rate for several 
days (24,20-J.?). 
No ir bands attributable 
to Type 
II 
hydrogen 
are found 
even 
though the extent of Type II adsorption 
is 
about twice that of Type 
I. The structure 
of Type II hydrogen 
is uncertain. 
Type 11 
hydrogen 
neither 
reacts with ethylene 
nor 
exchanges rapidly 
with reacting 
hydrogen 
during 
hydrogenation 
of 
ethylene, 
yet 
either Type II H2 or Dz serves to promote 
the rate of hydrogenation 
at room tempera- 
ture by about 30% (28). The presence of 
Type 11 hydrogen 
on a zinc oxide surface 
in the presence of dry oxygen at room tem- 
perature 
promotes 
poisoning 
of the cata- 
lyst by the water formed 
(or by its pre- 
cursor), an effect not found in the absence 
of Type II hydrogen 
(24). 
Type Ill 
hydrogen is evident at temper- 
atures near 78°K. 
Infrared 
ir bands are 
found at 4019, 
3507 and 2887 cm-’ 
for 
molecularly 
adsorbed 
HO. HD 
and Dz, 
respectively. 
There 
is an inverse equilib- 
rium isotope effect with a ratio of molecu- 
lar deuterium 
adsorbed 
to molecular 
hy- 
drogen adsorbed 
at constant 
pressure of 
about I .2 : I. Maximum 
surface coverage is 
about 
IO%, and there is strong evidence 
that this molecular 
adsorption 
occurs on 
the same sites that effect Type 
1 chemi- 
sorption 
(26,27). 
The interactions 
of oxygen and nitrogen 
adsorbed 
at 78°K 
with the pair sites on 
zinc oxide (and the hydrogen 
adsorbed on 
these sites) are different (34). Oxygen ad- 
sorbs nonspecifically 
with a constant 
iso- 
steric heat of adsorption, 
whereas nitrogen 
is, to some extent, specific with an initially 
higher heat of adsorption 
up to a surface 
coverage of IO-20%, 
beyond which it de- 
creases to a value close to that for oxygen. 
The effect of adsorbed water on the Type 1 
and Type

ports the suggestion that these three forms 
of adsorption 
occur on or near the same 
limited 
pair sites (27). 
Infrared 
studies show that the OH and 
ZnH band frequencies 
of Type I hydrogen 
are shifted up and down, respectively, 
by 
Type III 
hydrogen, 
by oxygen and by ni- 
trogen at -78°K. 
For oxygen and Type III 
hydrogen 
the 
relative 
shift 
in 
band 
frequencies 
is ) 
10 cm-‘1 ; however, nitrogen 
effects a larger shift of 123 cm-‘1. This dif- 
ference is interpreted 
as being due to the 
larger 
steric 
interaction 
of nitrogen 
ad- 
sorbed specifically 
at or near the sites that 
effect Type 
I hydrogen 
adsorption. 
The 
shift in frequencies 
due to oxygen adsorp- 
tion is seen as a monolayer 
is approached; 
however, the shift effected by nitrogen 
ad- 
sorption 
is seen for a percentage 
of sites 
near the initial 
molecular 
nitrogen 
adsorp- 
tion. 
The effect of adsorbed 
oxygen 
and ni- 
trogen on the spectrum 
corresponding 
to 
Type 
III 
hydrogen 
is also different 
(34). 
Both 
nitrogen 
and 
oxygen 
are 
more 
strongly adsorbed than Type III 
hydrogen. 
The initial 
molecular 
nitrogen adsorption 
is 
found to displace Type III 
hydrogen. 
The 
displacement 
is almost complete 
when the 
molecular 
nitrogen 
surface 
coverage 
is 
20%. Oxygen 
on the other hand does not 
readily displace Type III 
hydrogen 
until a 
monolayer 
is approached. 
The difference 
in the effect of adsorbed 
nitrogen 
and ox- 
ygen on the Type I and Type III 
hydrogen 
adsorbed on zinc oxide provides a method 
of distinguishing 
the role 
of these two 
forms of hydrogen in the allotropic 
conver- 
sion and isotopic 
exchange. 
The 
kinetic 
and adsorption 
measurements 
during 
ex- 
change in the presence and absence of ox- 
ygen and nitrogen 
are compared 
and their 
relationship 
to the various proposed mech- 
anisms are discussed below. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
METHODS 
The zinc oxide used in this study was 
Kadox 
25 obtained 
from the New Jersey 
Zinc Co. Samples 
ranging in size from 0.1 
to 20 g were pressed at 25,000 
psi in a 
stainless 
steel plug and were broken 
up 
before weighing 
in order to improve 
the 
flow characteristics. 
As a standard activa- 
tion procedure, 
the sample 
was degassed 
as the temperature 
was gradually 
raised 
from room temperature 
to 450°C. Oxygen 
at a pressure of 170 Torr was then circu- 
lated 
over 
the catalyst 
at 450°C 
for a 
period 
of 2 hr. The pressure was main- 
tained by circulating 
the oxygen through a 
liquid nitrogen 
bath at 78°K. If the activity 
of the catalyst had decreased significantly, 
oxygen activation 
was preceded by a 1 hr 
circulation 
of hydrogen 
gas at 45O”C, fol- 
lowed by a 2 hr evacuation. 
Subsequent 
to 
the 2 hr oxygen 
circulation, 
the catalyst 
was cooled 
to room 
temperature 
in ox- 
ygen. The oxygen was then pumped 
out 
for a period of several hours. This proce- 
dure 
was employed 
because 
it 
yields 
samples 
with good 
transmission 
in the 
infrared 
and provides 
catalysts 
directly 
comparable 
with those used for previously 
published 
studies (24-29). 
Surface areas as 
measured 
by 
BET 
nitrogen 
adsorption 
were 8.3 m2/g for initial 
activation 
and, 
after prolonged 
use, degenerated 
to about 
6 m”/g. 
Hydrogen 
and deuterium 
were purified 
by slow passage through an activated char- 
coal trap at 78°K. 
The nominal 
purity 
of 
the deuterium 
was 99.5%. 
Oxygen and nitrogen 
(both 99.9% pure) 
were purified by passage through a trap at 
78°K. They were stored in three-liter 
glass 
bulbs 
for use. The 
quantities 
adsorbed 
were measured 
by a standard 
BET 
mer- 
cury bulb system. 
Analysis 
of the allotropic 
concentration 
of the reacting hydrogen was monitored 
by 
two methods. 
Figure 
1 is a schematic 
rep- 
resentation 
of the system employed. 
In 
both methods 
reacting and adsorbed gases 
were introduced 
from the manifold 
(1) and 
measured by the bulb system (2). The first 
method 
involved 
chromatographic 
separa- 
tion of small aliquots (less than 1% of the 
345 cm3 reacting volume).

series at 78°K 
were employed, 
a 1.5 m 
alumina 
column 
to separate the allotropes 
and a 0.5 m column 
of alumina 
supported 
Fe3+ to separate the isotopes. The effluent 
hydrogen 
was converted 
to water over a 
CuO 
column 
at 500°C 
before 
it passed 
through 
the 
sample 
arm 
of the 
120°C 
thermistor 
bridge. 
Improved 
separation 
of both the allo- 
tropes and isotopes of hydrogen 
(but not 
ortho 
and para deuterium) 
was achieved 
by dosing the columns 
several times with 
purified 
carbon dioxide 
followed 
by rapid 
quenching 
of the columns 
from room tem- 
perature 
to 78°K 
immediately 
following 
the final CO, dose. The columns 
were ac- 
tivated 
in flowing 
helium 
at 135°C for a 
period of 6 to 12 hr and were then cooled 
to room temperature 
before the CO, treat- 
ment.

gas phase 
thermal 
conductivity 
measurements 
to 
obtain 
a comparison 
between the conversion 
of ortho-para 
deu- 
terium 
and ortho-hydrogen 
at low temper- 
atures. This involved 
use of systems I and 
II, in tandem, as shown in Fig. 1. The con- 
ductivity 
difference was measured at 78°K 
between 
hydrogen 
or deuterium 
(equili- 
brated 
at the reacting 
temperature 
over 
pure cr-chromia 
in the reference arm (7b) 
and bypassed 
during 
the 
run) 
and the 
reacting gas in the sample arm (7a). Repro- 
ducibility 
was achieved to within 
20% by 
this method 
and compared 
favorably 
with 
the results for hydrogen 
by the previous 
method. 
Possible contamination 
of the fila- 
ments 
by oxygen 
and nitrogen 
and the 
small thermal 
conductivity 
changes during 
a run limited 
the reproducible 
application 
of this method 
to the comparison 
of Hz 
and Dz conversion 
rates at temperatures 
near 78°K in the absence of adsorbed ox- 
ygen or nitrogen. 
The 
temperature 
of the catalyst 
was 
maintained 
at 78 and 90°K by liquid 
ni- 
trogen 
and liquid 
oxygen 
baths, 
respec- 
tively. 
A 
temperature 
of 
138°K 
was 
achieved by a solid-liquid 
equilibrium 
bath 
of 2,3-dimethylpentane. 
At temperatures 
above 
138°K 
a large 
residual gas phase pressure of oxygen was 
required to obtain a sufficiently 
large varia- 
tion in surface coverage. 
This 
gas phase 
oxygen 
would 
catalyze 
the 
ortho-para 
conversion 
on 
the 
alumina 
column 
(33-35). 
Therefore, 
measurements 
of the 
conversion 
in the presence of oxygen were 
restricted 
to temperatures 
below 13 8°K. 
RESULTS 
Oxygen promotion of allotropic conver- 
sion. The adsorption 
of oxygen on a sur- 
face has been shown to promote 
the catal- 
ysis of ortho-para 
conversion 
(12). Figure 
2 shows the effect of adsorbed oxygen on 
the ortho-para 
conversion 
rate at 78°K. A 
maximum 
is seen which 
approximately 
corresponds to one half a monolayer 
of ad- 
sorbed 
oxygen.

(35) is k, (molecules

This last factor is approximately 
equal to 
k x 3 X 1V8 (molecules

responds to the freshly

accordingly. 
This is the case for the com-

on a catalyst 
for 
which the rate was promoted 
by adsorp- 
tion of 0.25 cm3 g-l of oxygen at 78°K is 
shown in Fig. 3. The circles and squares

resents addition 
of 0.5 cm3 g-l of oxygen

of 0.5 cm3 g-l

circles correspond 
to runs for which the 
adsorbed gases were added at room tem- 
perature 
and the catalyst 
was quenched 
from 
room 
temperature 
to the reaction 
temperature 
to achieve 
the noted adsorp-

Ni-

also inhibits 
the ortho-para

Ethylene

of allotropic

sion. The rate of ortho-para 
conversion 
at 
room temperature 
was measured for a 200 
Torr hydrogen 
pressure in the presence of 
100 Torr 
ethylene 
in the gas phase. The 
rate decreased 
from 
2.3 X

without ethylene, 
to 0.8 x 10e2 g-l s-l with 
ethylene. 
Previously 
published 
data under 
similar 
conditions 
for the effect of 100 
Torr ethylene 
on the hydrogen-deuterium 
exchange rate indicates 
a rate without eth- 
ylene of 3.2 x low3 g-l s-’ compared 
to a 
rate of 1.1 X

ethylene for a system with a volume of 228

The 
second method 
of analysis 
was used to obtain the rates of ortho-para 
conversion 
for deuterium 
and hydrogen. 
The results 
at 78°K 
were for deuterium, 
k = 2 x 1c6 
g-l 
s-l, 
and for hydrogen 
k = 0.7 x 10e6 g-l 
s-l. The 
rate of deu- 
terium 
conversion 
is slightly 
greater than 
the rate of hydrogen 
conversion. 
With the 
conversion 
promoted 
by oxygen at 78°K a 
normal 
isotope effect (12) is found with the 
rate of hydrogen 
conversion 
greater than 
the rate of conversion 
for deuterium. 
DISCUSSION 
Possible 
mechanism 
for allotropic 
con- 
version and exchange. Three basic mecha- 
nisms have been proposed 
for allotropic 
conversion 
on the surface of a catalyst. 
With 
a zinc oxide 
catalyst, 
the active 
site has been proposed 
as an isolated 
zinc oxide pair that is capable of the dis- 
sociative 
adsorption 
(Type 
I) of hydrogen 
(giving 
rise to bands that correspond 
to 
ZnH and OH bonds) as well as adsorption 
at low temperature 
of a molecular 
species 
of hydrogen (Type III) 
at or near such pair 
sites. These mechanisms 
for Types 
1 and 
III 
hydrogen 
can be schematically 
repre- 
sented for a zinc oxide surface (Fig. 5). H 
and H’ are hydrogen 
or deuterium 
atoms 
and the primes 
are employed 
throughout 
each 
individual 
mechanism 
to 
indicate 
whether there is either exchange between 
atomic 
hydrogen 
from nearby sites, as in 
(A), or exchange 
between molecular 
and 
atomic hydrogen, 
as in (B) and (C). 
Some relevant 
comments 
and observa- 
tions are appropriate 
on each of these pro- 
posed mechanisms: 
A. 1. Proposed 
by 
Bonhoeffer 
and 
Farkas (5). 
2. Conversion 
will 
be faster 
than ex- 
change if klA 9 &A + k& or will be equal 
if k,, G k2A + k& and the surface site to 
site exchange occurs rapidly.

3. Surface mobility 
of hydrogen 
bound 
to zinc or oxygen atoms of the pair site is 
necessary for exchange. 
4. Molecular 
hydrogen 
adsorbed on the 
pair site would hinder the reaction 
if it had 
any effect at all. 
B. 1. Proposed 
by Rideal 
(6) and Eley 
(4). 
2. The 
rates 
of conversion 
and 
ex- 
change will always be the same order of 
magnitude, 
neglecting 
isotope 
effects, and 
exchange with adsorbed Type 
I hydrogen 
is implied. 
3. Molecular 
hydrogen 
is an intermedi- 
ate and the degree of surface coverage 
could have direct effect on the rate of con- 
version. 
C. 1. Proposed by Farkas ef al. (10-13) 
and with modifications 
by Van Cauwelaert 
and Hall (16). 
2. No 
exchange 
implied 
or necessary 
for conversion 
as in A or B. 
3. Molecular 
hydrogen 
would 
be the 
intermediate 
and, therefore, 
the rate of 
conversion 
would be directly 
related to the 
surface coverage 
by Type 
III 
hydrogen. 
Mechanisms for allotropic conversion at 
low temperature. 
Data 
given 
in the in- 
troduction 
indicate 
that 
Type 
III 
hy- 
drogen, oxygen, 
and nitrogen 
are all ad- 
sorbed in the vicinity 
of Type 1 hydrogen 
and that 
nitrogen 
and oxygen 
both can 
replace Type 
III 
hydrogen, 
although 
ni- 
trogen is bound more specifically 
than is 
oxygen 
to sites adjacent 
to Type 
1 hy- 
drogen. These conclusions 
are in complete 
agreement 
with the isotherms 
presented in 
Fig. 4. 
Hydrogen 
adsorption 
without 
O2 or N2 
is shown in the upper curve. The shape of 
the curve indicates 
a rapid chemical 
ad- 
sorption 
followed by “linear” 
physical ad- 
sorption, 
where the term linear applies to 
the dependence 
on pressure, 
implying 
a 
lower heat of adsorption. 
Adsorption 
of 
5.1 cm3 of oxygen 
yields 
reversible 
hy- 
drogen 
adsorption 
characteristic 
of the 
same type as was seen in the absence of 
oxygen for a catalyst of correspondingly 
lower surface. Nitrogen 
adsorption, 
on the 
other 
hand, 
significantly 
decreases 
the 
amount 
of nonlinear 
adsorption. 
Not only 
does it effect a correspondingly 
greater 
decrease than for oxygen, but the nature of 
the adsorption 
resembles 
linear 
physical 
adsorption. 
These 
results 
may 
be 
in- 
terpreted 
as selective blocking 
of the Type 
III 
molecular 
chemical 
adsorption 
by ni- 
trogen and not by oxygen, and blockage 
of

overall 
hydrogen 
adsorption 
in a random 
fashion by both. 
There are striking 
parallels 
between the 
results 
of ir and adsorption 
studies 
on 
Type 
III 
hydrogen 
and 
the results 
of 
kinetic 
studies on the effect of oxygen and 
nitrogen 
on allotropic 
conversion 
at low 
temperatures. 
Figure 3 shows that nitrogen 
reverses the promotional 
effect of oxygen 
on conversion. 
Extrapolation 
of the initial 
slope of this curve indicates 
that complete 
poisoning 
would occur at a nitrogen cover- 
age of 10 to 20% in agreement 
with the 
replacement 
of Type 
III 
hydrogen 
as in- 
dicated by ir spectra at a 10% surface cov- 
erage of Nz. Furthermore, 
the fact that 
readdition 
of oxygen 
does 
not 
restore 
activity 
is in agreement 
with the results 
mentioned 
in the introduction 
that oxygen 
is effective in completely 
displacing 
Type 
111 hydrogen 
only 
at almost 
monolayer 
coverage, 
implying 
random 
adsorption 
of 
oxygen. 
These 
similarities 
suggest 
that 
Type III 
hydrogen may indeed be an inter- 
mediate in ortho-para 
conversion. 
If Type 
III 
hydrogen 
is an important 
intermediate, 
the promotion 
of allotropic 
conversion 
by 
O2 would 
probably 
be 
caused by oxygen being adsorbed 
near a 
Type III 
hydrogen. 
If, as is implied 
by the 
data already presented, oxygen is adsorbed 
randomly, 
then for an oxygen surface cov- 
erage of &, we would expect the number 
of Type III 
sites which could be covered 
by hydrogen to be N,( 1 - 0,)) where N, is 
the total 
number 
of Type 
III 
sites. The 
rate of allotropic 
conversion 
should then 
be proportional 
to the number of Type III 
hydrogens 
adjacent 
to adsorbed 
oxygen 
and, therefore, 
we would expect 
R = k N,( 1 -&)8,. 
(1) 
Such a rate law would yield a maximum 
at 
half 
monolayer 
coverage 
in 
qualitative 
agreement 
with Fig. 2. 
The close similarity 
between allotropic 
conversion 
and Type 
III 
hydrogen 
makes 
mechanism 
A highly 
unlikely. 
In addition 
the inverse kinetic isotope effect for ortho- 
para conversion 
would not be expected for 
mechanism 
A if the allotropic 
conversion 
rate were very fast in comparison 
to the 
isotopic exchange rate. Table 
1 shows that 
conversion 
is indeed much more rapid than 
exchange. Since mechanism 
B requires the 
two rates to be comparable, 
and not in- 
dependent 
as shown in Table 
1, it too is 
excluded; 
we therefore 
conclude 
that the 
allotropic 
conversion 
must take place by 
the molecular mechanism 
C. 
Mechanism for isotopic exchange. Both 
mechanisms 
A and B would result in ex- 
change 
over 
zinc 
oxide. 
It 
has been 
suggested that mechanism 
B is dominant 
for 
exchange 
near 
room 
temperature. 
However, 
the equilibrium 
isotopic 
ratio 
(Ha2/HZ : Da2/Dz) based on this mechanism 
can be calculated 
from the published 
rate 
constant9 
and 
is found 
to be 
142 at 
213°K. 
This 
value seems unreasonable. 
The 
reported 
rate constants 
were calcu- 
lated assuming no kinetic isotope effect on 
adsorption. 
However, 
the adsorption 
of 
HD 
on zinc oxide 
below room 
tempera- 
ture indicates 
a marked 
kinetic 
isotope ef- 
fect but no significant 
equilibrium 
isotope 
effect (28) on adsorption. 
Mechanism 
B is 
not necessarily 
dominant. 
Comparison 
of the conversion 
and ex- 
change rates given in Table 
1 shows that 
the two processes involve different mecha- 
nisms at low temperature. 
Unlike 
the con- 
version 
rate the exchange 
rate does not 
reflect the behavior 
of Type III 
hydrogen. 
Consequently, 
mechanism 
B 
involving 
Type 
III 
hydrogen 
is eliminated.

seems unlikely 
that a Rideal-Eley 
mecha- 
nism, 
B, is effected via the most weakly 
bound 
form 
of molecular 
hydrogen, 
we 
regard 
some 
form 
of the 
Bonhoeffer- 
Farkas mechanism, 
A, as the likely 
path- 
way for the low temperature 
exchange. 
The ratio 
of the allotropic 
conversion 
rate in the absence of ethylene 
to the rate 
in the presence of ethylene reported 
in this 
paper 
is 2.9 at room 
temperature. 
The 
same numerical 
ratio was obtained 
for the 
isotopic 
exchange rate in the absence and 
presence of ethylene 
under similar 
condi- 
tions (29). This result may be indicative 
of 
a similar 
mechanism 
for the two reactions 
at room 
temperature, 
or may indicate 
a 
similar 
surface intermediate 
for the reac- 
tion. 
However, 
the allotropic 
conversion 
rate is an order of magnitude 
greater than 
the exchange 
rate. Mechanism 
B would 
predict 
the same order of magnitude 
for 
the two rates. Mechanism 
A is probably 
dominant 
at room temperature. 
The simplest interpretation 
of our data is 
that 
the 
exchange 
reaction 
occurs 
by 
mechanism 
A at all temperatures.

We have concluded 
that the 
ortho-para 
conversion 
at low temperature 
occurs by mechanism 
C. The 
following 
discussion 
shows that the observed 
dif- 
ference between the rate for hydrogen 
and 
for deuterium 
in the absence of oxygen is 
consistent 
with this mechanism 
and also 
explains 
the difference 
between 
rates in 
the gas phase and on the ZnO surface.

been treated 
theoretically 
for gas phase

collision 
with 
a paramagnetic

by Wigner 
(8). As noted by Van

(16), the collision

At longer times (i.e., for an adsorbed mole-

the effective ad-

and Ilk can be replaced by 712 where T is 
the

Therefore, 
Eq. (7) becomes

This is identical

becomes 
greater than 1 and Eq. (6) becomes

For an endothermic

(10) 
For zinc oxide (25,27,28) 
a sizeable bar- 
rier to rotation 
is needed to account for the 
measured 
isotope 
effect 
[(D,,/H,,),] 
of 
1.57; furthermore, 
the failure 
to observe 
AJ = 2 bands 
in the infrared 
(indicating 
that their intensity 
is an order of magni- 
tude less than the observed AJ = 0 bands) 
also suggests 
a high barrier 
to rotation. 
The observation 
of infrared 
bands corre- 
sponding to molecular 
hydrogen, which are 
forbidden 
in the gas phase, is a result of 
this hindered 
rotation 
and its effect on the 
induced 
dipole 
moment 
of the adsorbed 
molecular 
species. The 
difference 
in the 
perpendicular 
and parallel 
component 
of 
the polarizability 
of the adsorbed hydrogen 
molecule 
(0.21 
A3) 
allows 
chromato- 
graphic 
separation 
of the allotropes 
(15). 
Hindered 
rotation 
of a surface adsorbed 
molecule 
also changes the energy levels of 
the adsorbed 
molecule. 
If such an effect 
takes place, the ratio of the rate with dif- 
ferent E level 
spacing 
(R,, ) to the rate 
with the same E level spacing (R,,O) (as is 
the case in the gas phase) is

(11) 
King 
and Benson 
(15) have provided 
a 
graphic 
estimation 
of the effect on these 
energy levels by the barrier height to rota- 
tion. For a barrier to rotation 
of 2 kcal at 
78°K (RoI/Ro,o)H, 
= 263 [(cos 13)~/(cos 0)“’ 
=789 
as the ratio of the cosine terms is 
on the order of three due to the preferred 
orientation 
of the hydrogen 
perpendicu- 
lar to the surface (15). For deuterium 
the 
effect is even more dramatic 
where it can 
be estimated 
that for the same barrier 
to 
rotation 
at 78°K 
(‘OS e)2 9.6 x lo3 = 2.9 x 1oQ. 
& = (cos ey 
This explains the change in the ratio of the 
rates 
of ortho-para 
conversion 
of hy- 
drogen to deuterium 
which is 5.4: 1 in the 
gas phase at 83°K to a ratio of about 1 : 2 
on the surface 
of zinc oxide at 78°K. The 
hindering 
of rotation 
effects a change in 
energy level differences that is more dra- 
matic 
for deuterium 
than 
for hydrogen 
and, therefore, 
the rate of conversion 
for 
deuterium 
can be greater 
than 
that 
for 
hydrogen. 
CONCLUSION 
For zinc oxide it is therefore 
concluded 
that 
isotopic 
exchange 
of hydrogen 
at 
room 
temperature 
and below occurs by 
some 
form 
of 
the 
Bonhoeffer-Farkas 
210 
CONNER 
AND 
KOKES 
mechanism, 
involving 
Type 
I hydrogen, 
while allotropic 
conversion 
of hydrogen 
is 
dominated 
at low temperatures 
by a para- 
magnetic 
conversion 
of a molecular 
ad- 
sorbed hydrogen 
species. This mechanism 
is enhanced by the high barrier to rotation 
for Type III 
molecular 
hydrogen. At room 
temperature 
where Type 
III 
hydrogen 
is 
not evident, 
the allotropic 
conversion 
is 
dominated 
by an adsorption-desorption 
mechanism 
involving 
atomic 
hydrogen 
where 
the 
slower 
site-to-site 
exchange 
makes the conversion 
proceed more rap- 
idly than the Hz-D2 
exchange. One effect 
of the high barrier 
to rotation 
over zinc 
oxide is to increase 
the low temperature 
allotropic 
conversion 
of deuterium 
to a 
greater extent than hydrogen.
