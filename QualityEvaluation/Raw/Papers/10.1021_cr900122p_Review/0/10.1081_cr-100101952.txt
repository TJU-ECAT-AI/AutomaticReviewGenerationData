ABSTRACT
Ranking high in the current challenges of catalysis, direct transformations of lower
saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) have been investigated for a long time. However,
unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., aromatics and oleﬁns) have always been the more
important feedstocks to produce basic and intermediate chemicals because of their
wide variety of possible reaction pathways. This article focuses on the conversion
of one representative of lower alkanes—ethane, which is an important constituent
of natural gas, accompanying gases and waste efﬂuents of petrochemical pro-
cesses—to aromatic compounds.
Following general considerations on the aromatization of ethane, efﬁcient
modiﬁcation methods of MFI-type zeolites to obtain active and selective catalysts
will be presented. The nature of active sites, including the promoting effects of
zinc, gallium, or noble metals, will be discussed. Single pathways in the reaction
network from ethane toward aromatic hydrocarbons are explored based on experi-
ments under steady-state and transient-state conditions. Finally, an outlook for
possible transformations of the fundamental knowledge to full-scale industrial ap-
plication will be given.

I.
INTRODUCTION
For typical commodity chemical processes, feedstock constitutes about 60–
70% of the total manufacturing costs. Therefore, a great ﬁnancial impact should
result from moving to a lower-cost feedstock. By far the strongest current thrust
toward lower-cost feedstocks is the effort to substitute oleﬁns with the correspond-
ing alkanes [2]. The expected economical savings are at a level that even a rela-
tively low-efﬁcient conversion could become economically superior to an estab-
lished process.
The chemical utilization of short-chain alkanes (C , 6) is one of the domi-
nant scientiﬁc challenges in the ﬁeld of petrochemistry. These compounds occur
in accompanying gases of petroleum [liquid petroleum gas (LPG), up to 70% C2–
C5 alkanes] and in natural gas (see Table 1). Furthermore, reﬁnery processes such
as ﬂuid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydrotreating operations produce large
amounts of saturated compounds. Additionally, the world’s natural gas reserves
are at least comparable to or even larger than those of petroleum [4].
By using natural gas preferentially for energy production, the chemical po-
tential of its constituents is wasted this time. It can be expected that natural gas
will emerge as an important feedstock to produce hydrocarbons, although crude

oil will remain the principle source of fuels and petrochemicals in the foreseeable
future. Targets of interest for direct transformations of lower alkanes comprise,
for example, ethane to acetic acid [5], propane to acrylonitrile, and butane to
tetrahydrofuran. A further upgrading application of LPG is their conversion into
lower aromatics [benzene, toluene, xylenes (BTX)].
Despite strong restrictions for the use of lower aromatics as a blending mix-
ture to enhance the octane number of gasoline (legal content of benzene in gasoline
in Europe: 1–2 vol%; in the United States, Japan, and Canada: #1 vol% [6–8]),
they still belong to the important key products of the chemical industry. The small-
est aromatic hydrocarbon benzene, for example, is mostly used to produce styrene
followed by cumene and cyclohexane. Furthermore, converting accompanying
gases to BTX, the latter could be easily fed into the already existing pipeline for
transportation of petroleum. This aspect might be especially interesting for remote
regions to get transportable liquids.
Naturally, the ﬁrst successful attempts to convert chain-type hydrocarbons
to aromatics have been reported for the more reactive alkenes as starting materials.
As early as 1946, Russian workers converted butene into aromatic compounds
(benzene, xylenes, and trimethylbenzene, in particular) on an alumosilicate cata-
lyst at temperatures above 723 K [9]. Later, Rapoport et al. [10] isolated isomers
of xylene after polymerization of iso-butene on a MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst at tempera-
tures above 473 K.
In contrast to oleﬁnes, lower parafﬁns are generally much harder to activate
in a chemical transformation. Therefore, the similarity of a hypothetical aromatiza-
tion reaction using lower alkanes compared to the classical reforming process
inspired the idea of using bifunctional catalysts in the ﬁrst attempts of alkane
conversion. In the early 1970s, Csicsery, who created the terminus dehydrodimeri-
zation, used a platinum supported on alumina catalyst for the aromatization of
C3–C5 alkanes [11]. However, the high coking rate prevented further applications.

At that time, Bragin et al. established the ﬁrst successful aromatization of ethene
[12] and ethane [13] on Pt/Al2O3 in a pulse reactor.
With the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolites by MOBIL (zeolite socony mobil [14]),
a new class of shape selective catalysts emerged (Fig. 1). This crystalline structure
containing aluminum and silicon oxides was found to be selective in the conver-
sion of methanol and other oxygen-containing compounds to gasoline [15,16].
The structure consists of an interconnected channel system of medium size chan-
nels with openings of 0.51 3 0.55 and 0.53 3 0.56 nm, respectively [17], which
prevents fast coking of the active centers located preferentially in the spatially
constrained inner surface [18]—an advantage over amorphous oxidic catalysts
and other zeolites known at that time.
Arising from intensive research, several industrially interesting processes to
transform lower hydrocarbons with carbon numbers C $ 3 into aromatics have
been developed (e.g., M2 forming: alkanes/oleﬁns with C $ 3 on H-ZSM-5 zeo-
lite [19], CYCLAR process: propane/butane on gallium containing ZSM-5 zeo-
lites [20], aroforming: C5–C6 alkanes, and Z-forming: C3–C4 alkanes [21]).
The ﬁrst commercially attractive conversions of ethane were claimed by Chu
[22], reaching ,35% with 63% selectivity to aromatics on Cu/Zn–ZSM-5 zeolites
at 866 K. However, a transfer into commercial production has still not been devel-
oped for ethane conversions.
A careful exploration of the review papers on the conversion and the aromati-
zation of lower parafﬁns and oleﬁns, which have been published in recent years
(e.g., Refs. 21 and 23–27), reveals that only a few lines or paragraphs are usually
devoted to the special topic of ethane aromatization. Actually, ethane is frequently
discussed as an undesired cleavage product in the aromatization process of paraf-
ﬁns with C $ 3. However, as ethane itself represents a potential reactant for aro-
matization and as the process is quite distinct from and more difﬁcult to accom-

plish than other parafﬁn conversions, it is appropriate to review the present
knowledge of aromatization using ethane as the feedstock. In this frame, the aro-
matization of ethane will be discussed on the basis of mechanistic studies in the
low conversion range to resolve single reaction steps leading to principles for the
economically more interesting high conversion ranges. Moreover, the formation
and nature of active centers will be discussed.
II.
THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC CONSIDERATIONS
Before starting to report on experimental studies of the conversion of ethane
to aromatic compounds, limits imposed by the thermodynamics have to be dis-
cussed. From selected calculations for the endothermic transformation of parafﬁns
to unsaturated hydrocarbons (see Table 2), it follows that (1) aromatics are the
favored products compared to oleﬁns and (2) the conversion of lower parafﬁns
into aromatics is facilitated by increasing the carbon number of the chain. Rather
satisfactory conversions can be achieved when carrying out the aromatization of
parafﬁns with C $ 3 at temperatures below 773 K. This has led to a concentration
of research efforts on these reactants.
To obtain a more detailed picture of the thermodynamics of ethane aromati-
zation, conversions were calculated on the basis of the following three equations:

Results, presented in Fig. 2, reveal that temperatures above 700 K are necessary
to obtain conversions higher than 20%. This fact, in turn, draws special attention
onto the necessary thermal stability of potential catalysts. For the smallest alkane,
methane, direct aromatization requires exceptionally high temperatures (e.g., Refs.
28 and 29) for thermodynamic reasons [25]. The direct aromatization of methane
was studied at temperatures around 973 K on Mo/H-ZSM-5 [29–32], Mo–W/H-
ZSM-5 [33,34], Fe/H–ZSM-5 [35], and other transition-metal-modiﬁed H-ZSM-
5 [36].
The addition of coreactants is a useful tool to overcome the thermodynamic
limitations of a direct conversion. In order to enhance the formation of C2 and
C21 compounds from the starting molecule methane, the oxidizing reagents
oxygen, oleﬁns, or nitrous oxide were cofed [25,37–39]. Recently, Baerns and
Buyevskaya [40] and Ban
˜ares [41] published reviews discussing the oxidative
conversion of lower alkanes. Although a vast spectrum of products could be
obtained by carefully directing the conditions of selective oxidation, industrial
application is still a remote future.
Besides coreaction, one can imagine that the addition of an acceptor for
hydrogen formed during the aromatization [see Eqs. (1)–(3)] would shift the reac-
tion equilibrium toward the products. Theoretical results for the conversion of
ethane in the presence of carbon dioxide are shown in Fig. 3 (see also Ref. 42),
including Eqs. (1) and (4). They conﬁrm that benzene formation from ethane could
be enhanced by the addition of carbon dioxide.

Recently, Choudhary et al. [43] showed the effect of the addition of alkenes
to ethane on the free Gibbs energy of the aromatization reaction (Table 3). The
value for ∆G decreases with increasing the ratio additive/ethane.

The high stability of lower parafﬁns points to the importance of the initial
activation step. Based on the concept of superacids established by Olah et al.
[44–46], protonation of the molecule to form a so-called nonclassic carbonium
ion (Scheme 1, species in brackets) is possible [47] (for H–ZSM-5 zeolites, see
Ref. 48). There are two activation pathways: (1) attack of the acid proton on the
parafﬁnic CEH bond or (2) insertion of the proton into the CEC bond of the

parafﬁn. Path (1) proceeds via hydride transfer to form a carbenium ion and molec-
ular hydrogen (Scheme 1a). Following path 2, a methane molecule is released
(Scheme 1b). The stability of the intermediate carbocations determines whether
a CEH or a CEC bond, and which CEC bond in higher parafﬁns, is cleaved.
Iron- and manganese-promoted sulfated zirconia (FMSZ) seem to possess
these superacid properties, converting ethane at temperatures as low as 473 K
[49]. At a temperature of 723 K, zeolite H–ZSM-5 showed a performance compa-
rable to FMSZ, suggesting the occurrence of carbonium ion reactions.
By analyzing the primary products formed from lower alkanes on H-ZSM-5
at 803 K, Guisnet et al. [50] calculated the rate constants for the two cleavage
modes (Scheme 2). The scission of an alkane at the CEH bond produces an alkene
and hydrogen, and at the CEC bond, an alkene and an alkane. The CEC bond
protolysis of ethane is the slowest reaction (Scheme 2). This is easily understood
because the latter reaction goes via highly unstable intermediates (i.e., a primary
carbonium ion and a methyl carbocation). Additionally, hydride transfer is re-
quired to transform the latter into methane (e.g., by abstraction from another al-
kane molecule). The rates of CEH and CEC bond scissions increase when going
from ethane through propane to iso-butane, thus corresponding nicely to the stabil-

ity of intermediate carbenium ions in the sequence primary , secondary , tertiary
species [50].
As already stated, carbonium ions are highly reactive species which can only
be detected by their evolving products. Experimental evidence for the formation
of carbonium ions as intermediates were found by evaluating the initial selectivi-
ties of cracking reactions of alkanes on acid-type zeolites. In addition to the classi-
cal bimolecular cracking route, which involves carbenium ion intermediates, Haag
and Dessau [48] interpreted experimental results obtained in the cracking of hex-
ane and hexane isomers on H–Y and H-ZSM-5 zeolites in terms of a new pathway,
called monomolecular or protolytic cracking. The formation of hydrogen, meth-
ane, and ethane was thought to proceed via carbonium ions, which, in turn, are
formed from the alkane adsorbed on Brønsted-acid sites of the zeolite. Both path-
ways—monomolecular and bimolecular—contribute to the reaction network of
cracking to different extents. However, as a tendency, it was found that the mono-
molecular route becomes more dominant with low conversions, low hydrocarbon
pressure, and high temperature. Shortly after Haag and Dessau, Corma et al. [51]
presented similar evidence for the formation of carbonium ions while cracking
heptane on rare earth (RE)–H–Y zeolites.
Attempts were made to describe the process from the uptake of the proton
to the geometry of possible transition states and, eventually, the formation of the
reaction products by means of theoretic simulations (e.g., Refs. 52–55). It was
calculated that activation energies for protolytic dehydrogenation and cracking of
ethane are close for protonated zeolites (397 kJ mol21 and 391 kJ mol21, respec-
tively [54]). The main drawbacks of the computational efforts so far are, however,
the limited sizes of the clusters representing the proton-carrying catalyst and the
fact that conﬁnement effects are not considered [56]. Therefore, the real proton-
abstraction energies are not yet fully represented. This, in turn, leads to a strong
overestimation of activation energies compared to experimental data [53]. More
recent calculations gave 297 kJ mol21 and 292 kJ mol21 for the activation barriers
of ethane dehydrogenation and cracking, respectively [55], these values being
closer to experimental results for the apparent activation energy of ethane conver-
sion on H–ZSM-5 zeolites (105 kJ mol21, 673–723 K) [49].
With most authors speaking about carbocations, Kazansky [57] recently
posed the argument that these species should be considered as ionlike transition
states. In contrast to superacid chemistry in solution, they cannot exist when de-
tached from the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst.
Besides protons possessing strong acid properties, strongly electrophilic cen-
ters with Lewis-acid properties should also be able to attack the CEH and CEC
bonds of parafﬁns. Models, analog to the one depicted in Scheme 1, were dis-
cussed, protons being substituted by Lewis centers M1 [47].
The presence of metal centers, on the other hand, may contribute to dehydro-
genate the alkane to the corresponding oleﬁn. Once being activated, ethane and
its dehydrogenation product ethene can further react to yield oligomers on acid
sites via surface ethoxy species. The strength of the acid centers determines the

interaction of ethene with the surface of the catalyst. It ranges from physisorption
on Na–X or Na–Y zeolites, through hydrogen-bonding on H–Y zeolite, to surface
ethoxy species on very strong acid centers of H-ZSM-5 and H–MOR zeolites
[58]. A key role of chemisorbed ethene in the reaction network describing the
methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process was proposed by Dejaifve et al. [59].
A primary carbenium ion is necessary for the ﬁrst step of oligomerization.
These species are energetically unfavorable. However, their formation may still
proceed in the environment of strong acid sites by scission of carbonium ions
[60] and under kinetic coupling conditions [61]. For the formation of aromatic
hydrocarbons and their transformation reactions, various pathways, as, for exam-
ple, hydrogen addition and abstraction, hydride transfer, cycloaddition, alkylation,
and isomerization, are known from homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis as
well [62,63]. However, degradation reactions can also occur, leading to undesired
side products. Thermal and catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis are examples
of these processes [48,64–69].
III.
CATALYSTS FOR THE CONVERSION OF
LOWER PARAFFINS
A.
Preliminary Considerations on Choosing the Catalyst
Following from Section II, a catalyst with strong acid sites and high thermal
stability is needed for the aromatization of ethane. Consequently, several highly
siliceous zeolites of the pentasil type were screened for their application in the
aromatization process. The main representative of this group of zeolites is the
MFI (mobil ﬁve [14]) or ZSM-5 zeolite with Si and Al as framework atoms (see
Fig. 1). These zeolites have successfully been used in the petrochemical industry
(e.g., alkylation, isomerization, disproportionation of alkyl-aromatic compounds,
and cracking [70,71]). The following reasons account for their potential for the
aromatization of ethane:
1.
Pentasil-type zeolites possess the high thermal stability [72] necessary
for operation at high reaction temperature (see thermodynamic calcula-
tions in Sec. II).
2.
The sizes of the interconnected channels in the zeolite (0.51 3 0.55 nm
and 0.53 3 0.56 nm [17]) permit the formation and transportation of
lower aromatic hydrocarbons as benzene, toluene, and xylene. How-
ever, higher alkylated aromatics, which contribute to deactivation via
coking, are excluded from the channel system (shape selectivity of cok-
ing [73]).
3.
The incorporation of aluminum into a TO4 tetrahedron causes a negative
lattice charge, which can be compensated by the exchange of protons
(Brønsted-acid sites) and/or metal cations (Lewis-acid sites). The Si/Al
ratio of the zeolite can be adjusted between 10 and ∞[74] in the synthe-

sis, which determines the acid properties. ZSM-5 materials are obtained
by hydrothermal synthesis with, for example, tetrapropyl ammonium
bromide as organic directing agent [14] or in a more restricted composi-
tion range without the application of an organic structure directing com-
pound (template) [75,76].
4.
Besides acid sides, noble metals can be also supported to act as
hydrogenation/dehydrogenation centers.
5.
Further tuning of the catalytic behavior of zeolites can be achieved by
isomorphous incorporation of other atoms replacing either Si or Al
(e.g., B, Fe [77]).
In contrast to the reaction of other parafﬁns with C $ 3, the conversion of
ethane on H-ZSM-5 is as low as 2–3 wt%, even at temperatures of 823 K [78,79].
Thus, introduction of ethane-activating components is necessary to obtain higher
conversions, whereas in the case of propane and higher parafﬁns, a modiﬁcation
of the zeolite also serves to increase the selectivity to the formation of aromatic
hydrocarbons [25,79]. Although a wide variety of promoters and their combina-
tions have been screened for the aromatization of ethane (see Table 4), only some
noble metals, gallium and zinc, have shown reasonable promoter effects and de-
served further attention.
A survey of the results obtained in the aromatization of ethane on a variety
of modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites is given in Table 5. It must be stated that the experi-
mental conditions of catalyst preparation (e.g., Si/Al ratio, modiﬁcation method,
metal content) as well as reaction conditions (e.g., pretreatment, carrier gas, space
velocity, reaction time) differ from one reference to the other. Nevertheless, a
global picture of the possible performances of such catalysts for the conversion
of ethane to aromatics can be deduced.
Regarding activity and selectivity, promising results were obtained on zinc-
modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites; two examples of aromatic distributions are shown in
Table 6. Therefore, these catalyst systems will be discussed in the following sub-
section in more detail. However, because of their importance in the aromatization-

metals) promoters will also be examined brieﬂy.

Promoters in Modiﬁed H-ZSM-5
1.
Zinc
While screening promoters for ethane aromatization, zinc emerged as a pro-
spective candidate. Modiﬁcation of the zeolite can be done during or after synthe-
sis, thereby incorporating zinc with the precursors Zn, ZnS, ZnO, or Zn salts (e.g.,
nitrate or chloride). Usually, zinc cations are introduced into a zeolite by repeated
ion exchange with a solution of the corresponding salt (often, a nitrate). Addition-
ally, zinc can be incorporated into the zeolite by impregnation of the zeolite with
a zinc salt followed by drying or even by a simple mechanical mixing of the
zeolite with a metal salt (or the oxide). An alternative method of incorporation
is the addition of the zinc source (e.g., as ZnS [105]) to the synthesis gel of the
zeolite, which should provide a uniform distribution of zinc species over the zeo-
lite crystal. The following nomenclature for zinc-containing zeolites will be ap-
plied in the subsequent text: ion-exchanged samples, Zn-ZSM-5; impregnated
samples, ZnO/H-ZSM-5; samples prepared by mechanical mixing, ZnO 1 H-
ZSM-5; and zinc introduced into framework positions of the zeolite during the
synthesis, [Zn]MFI.
Surprisingly, the catalytic performance of zinc containing H-ZSM-5 zeolites
in ethane aromatization at 773 and 873 K does not depend on the modiﬁcation
technique. Speciﬁcally, samples prepared by mechanical mixing of ZnO and H-
ZSM-5, impregnation of Zn(NO3)2 onto H-ZSM-5, or multiple ion exchange of
H-ZSM-5 with Zn(NO3)2 gave the same results [79,106]. A similar observation
was made in the aromatization of other parafﬁns as well (e.g., propane [25] and
n-hexane [107]). Either of the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) all kinds
of zinc species catalyze the aromatization of ethane in the same way or (2) active
zinc species of equal nature are formed during the precatalytic treatment procedure
or in the initial period of the reaction.
To answer this question, the acid properties of the catalysts were character-
ized. A variety of methods were applied [e.g., infrared (IR) spectroscopy, tempera-
ture-programmed desorption (TPD) of basic test molecules, proton magic-angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-MAS NMR) spectroscopy, microcalori-
metry, ion exchange, adsorption/desorption, x-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES), extended x-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS), and test reactions].
Using methods comprising the adsorption of probe molecules, Kazansky [108]
pointed out that, preferably, the reacting molecules themselves should be adsorbed
(e.g., methane, ethane) because the generally applied strong bases such as ammo-
nia or pyridine are not comparable to the reactants with respect to the nature and
strength of their interactions with zeolites as the adsorbent.
Characterization revealed that exchange of H–ZSM-5 zeolite with zinc ions
created Lewis-acid centers. The number of Brønsted-acid sites diminished accord-

ingly [100,102,106,109–115]. When mechanical mixtures ZnO 1 H-ZSM-5 were
subjected to thermal treatment, thereby simulating the in situ pretreatment preced-
ing the catalytic reaction to remove adsorbed water from the zeolite channels, a
similar process—solid-state ion exchange—was observed (see, e.g., Refs. 106,
112,113, and 116):
ZnO 1 2HEOzeolite →Zn(Ozeolite)2 1 H2O
(5)
This solid-state reaction has been intensively studied as a method to incorpo-
rate cations into various zeolite systems without the necessity of handling large
volumes of solvents [117].
The system (ZnO, H-ZSM-5 zeolite) was investigated by in situ diffuse re-
ﬂectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy [118]. A solid-state reaction
was clearly observed at 823 K, where protons of both Brønsted-acid sites and,
partially, silanol groups are involved. Simultaneously with the decrease of concen-
tration of Brønsted-acid sites, water is formed inside the channels, as evident from
Eq. (5). Depending on the amount of zinc supplied, the ion-exchange degrees
were
12%,
43%,
and
88%,
respectively
(molar
ratio:
ZnO:2H–ZSM-5 5 1:1, 5:1, and 10:1) [118]. The crystal size and morphology
of the zeolite as well as the intimacy of the mixed components also inﬂuenced
the exchange degree.
In addition to ZnO as a metal source, zinc dust was recently shown to un-
dergo a similar solid-state reaction according to Eq. (6). The heat treatment of a
mixture of Zn and H–MOR or H–Y zeolite in vacuum or inert gas leads to the
formation of zinc cations in the zeolite and the release of hydrogen [119]:
Zn 1 2HEOzeolite →Zn(Ozeolite)2 1 H2
(6)
When quantifying the extent of zinc exchange via solid-state ion exchange
by observing the change of intensity of the corresponding IR absorption bands
(Brønsted-acid hydroxyl groups and pyridine adsorbed at these centers: 3605 and
1545 cm21, respectively), one must also consider the dehydroxylation of the zeo-
lite at temperatures above ,770 K, as this process can interfere with changes
caused by solid-state ion exchange. Such interferences can be avoided by using
a method speciﬁcally focusing on zinc, such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy.
By evaluating the features of XANES spectra and comparing them with those of
reference compounds, it was possible to distinguish between zinc species located
at cationic sites, oxidic zinc species, and zinc incorporated into lattice positions
of the zeolite (Fig. 4). The spectrum of a mechanical mixture after reaction with
ethane was simulated by superimposing the spectra of zinc cations and ZnO [120].
Thus, the solid-state ion exchange could be directly revealed.
Under reaction conditions, solid-state ion exchange between zinc ions and
zeolite protons proceeds in the initial period of the reaction. It is reﬂected by an
induction period; that is, the increase of ethane conversion with time on stream
in a plug ﬂow reactor (or propane in a pulse reactor [100]) until a constant value

is reached [121] (Fig. 5). Yao et al. [122] also observed an induction period during
the conversion of n-butane on gallium and zinc oxide containing H-ZSM-5 zeo-
lites, which lasted between 20 and 40 min. The authors did not comment on this;
however, they excluded a solid-state ion exchange. In contrast to the mechanical
mixture, a zinc ion-exchanged H-ZSM-5 showed a constant conversion of ethane
right from the start of the reaction (Fig. 5).

The temperature dependence of the solid-state ion-exchange process was
examined under reaction conditions (Fig. 6 [121]). The in situ pretreatment of the
zeolites before reaction was done at 723 K. The solid-state ion exchange just
started to proceed at this temperature, which led to conversions of ethane around
15 wt% on the mechanical mixture ZnO 1 H-ZSM-5. When the reaction tempera-
ture was raised above this temperature, the conversion sharply increased, presum-
ably because new active sites were formed by solid-state ion exchange (Fig. 6).
This formation seems to be completed at temperatures around 770 K. From this
temperature, the conversions of ethane obtained on ZnO 1 H-ZSM-5 were compa-
rable to those observed using zinc-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 6).
Finally, evaluating the state of zinc in H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion
exchange in aqueous solution by XANES, an octahedral coordination of zinc
species involving two water molecules in the hydrated state was determined
[123,124]. Analysis of the extended ﬁne structure (EXAFS) gave ZnEO distances
of 2.09 A
˚ , with only oxygen atoms as nearest neighbors. Dehydration gave rise
to a decrease in the intensity of the XANES structure, revealing a decrease in the
coordination number caused by desorption of water [123,124]. On the other hand,
zinc containing H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by impregnation contained zinc at
cationic positions and ZnO clusters. The latter are susceptible to reduction and
sublimation under aromatization conditions [124].
2.
Gallium
When gallium ions were introduced into the pentasil zeolite (e.g., by impreg-
nation), the major part remained outside the zeolite channels [88,109,125,126].

This can be explained by the large radius of solvated Ga31 species and by the
electrostatic hindrances arising from the necessity to compensate three negative
lattice charges. Under reducing conditions (e.g., pretreatment with hydrogen or
the aromatization reaction), part of the Ga31 ions were reduced to Ga1 ions, which
can migrate into the channels and form active centers. The addition of platinum
accelerated the in situ reduction of Ga2O3 by supplying (spillover) hydrogen (e.g.,
Ref. 127). Further, the function of spillover hydrogen was to hydrogenate coke
precursors, thereby reducing deactivation [127]. Starting from an isomorphously
substituted [Ga]MFI, the removal of gallium ions from the lattice while preserving
the zeolite structure seemed to be the key step to increase activity for the aromati-
zation of propane [128].
Special emphasis on the mode of preparation was drawn by Dooley et al.
[129], with speciﬁc attention to the vicinity of the zeolite to the gallium precursor.
Intimate mixtures (also obtained by the impregnation technique) enabled the re-
duction and dispersion of gallium species inside the zeolite. A long-range syner-
gism (long-range hydrogen back spillover in propene and butane conversion) was
also observed for hybrid systems, where the zeolite and the gallium species were
locked in separate phases [130,131].
Meitzner et al. [132] characterized gallium species by in situ x-ray absorption
spectroscopy during pretreatment and propane aromatization. The authors demon-
strated that partly positively charged Gaδ1 species were formed under reducing
conditions, being stable only in situ and subjected to reoxidation if the samples
were cooled to room temperature.
The research of Russian scientists on the aromatization of lower parafﬁns
(propane, butane, pentane) was summarized by Minachev and Dergachev [133,
134]. They concluded that the inﬂuence of gallium in pentasils on activity and
selectivity was dependent on the composition of the sample, its acid properties, the
promoter concentration, the modiﬁcation method, and the pretreatment conditions.
Looking at the speciﬁc role of gallium in H-ZSM-5 for ethane aromatization,
Keipert and Baerns [135] demonstrated that its presence was necessary to activate
ethane, giving ethene, under transient conditions at temperatures of about 873 K
and above. Using a conventional ﬂow reactor, the gallium content was optimized
with respect to activity and selectivity [89]. With a catalyst containing 3 wt%
gallium on H-ZSM-5, detailed kinetic investigations were undertaken and a model
established, including the bifunctional action of gallium and acid sites (also sug-
gested by Doyemet et al. [136]) in ethane aromatization [104]. According to the
results, ethene was the initial product formed on gallium sites. It was subjected
to a cycle of oligomerization, isomerization, and cracking on acid sites, leading
to a pool of rapidly interconverting oleﬁns, with propene being the only detectable
molecule. On acid sites, these oleﬁns were further converted to aromatics by cycli-
zation and hydrogen transfer. Gallium participated by accepting surface hydrogen.
The formation of methane was attributed to the secondary cracking of higher
oligomers [104].

Noble Metals
To introduce noble metals into zeolites, the samples are usually treated with a
metal complex and calcined. A subsequent reduction procedure provides metallic
centers. Parameters inﬂuencing the state and dispersion of the metal are the solvent
of the precursor, the nature of the precursor, and the conditions of calcination and
reductive treatment.
Noble metals were introduced into H-ZVM (a Russian analog to H-ZSM-
5) by Bragin et al. [92]. The addition of platinum led to a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase
of activity in ethane aromatization compared to the hydrogen form of the zeolite.
By studying the reaction in a pulse reactor, a development of the aromatization
activity was observed with increasing pulse numbers (Fig. 7, data from Refs. 91
and 92). In parallel, the authors studied the electronic state of platinum in the
course of the reaction by transferring the catalyst samples under inert atmosphere
into a XPS spectrometer [91]. Accordingly, Bragin et al. [91] suggested that par-
tially positively charged Ptγ1 species governed the aromatization activity in ethane
conversion. This active form was generated in situ irrespective of whether Pt0/
H- or Pt21/H-pentasils were used initially [137]. H-pentasils containing ﬁnely dis-
persed metal particles were found to be more active for the aromatization of ethane
than samples with large clusters (1 nm versus 10 nm) [137]. The dispersion, in
turn, was strongly inﬂuenced by the pretreatment. Precalcination of [Pt(NH3)4]21
on ZSM-5 in air resulted in the decomposition of the complex, migration of Pt21
ions into the channels, and partial reduction of platinum. The subsequent treatment
with hydrogen led to additional reduction, giving a uniform distribution and a
stable dispersion of platinum in the channels [83,138].
Reschetilowski et al. [97] varied the impregnation method and, consequently,
the dispersion of platinum in H-ZSM-5. The initial activity of these catalysts in

421
the ethane conversion to form ethene was found to be insensitive to dispersion.
However, a high dispersion and, therefore, a closer contact between platinum and
acid sites led to a higher electrophilicity of the metal clusters. This, in turn, caused
a higher stability of the metal–oleﬁn chemisorption complexes, thereby favoring
consecutive reactions of the oleﬁns, leading to coke precursors and coke. The
hydrogen formed during the reaction suppressed coke formation on the one hand
but also inhibited ethene formation and, consequently, aromatization, on the other
[98]. Addition of hydrogen to the ethane feed when using Pt/H-ZSM-5 gave
suppressed aromatization and increased hydrogenolysis reactions to form meth-
ane [96].
IV.
STUDIES ON THE REACTION MECHANISM OF THE
AROMATIZATION OF ETHANE
As already pointed out in Section II, the activation of ethane is the most
important step for the aromatization. The question arises to which extent both
kinds of active center (Brønsted- and/or Lewis-acid sites) are involved in the
activation process and in the subsequent steps leading to aromatics.
Concentrating on the primary reaction steps using zinc containing ZSM-5,
the formation of ethene is the main reaction at low conversions and short contact
times. With increasing zinc content, the formation of ethene is increased (Fig. 8
[79]), which underlines the importance of zinc species for the activation process.
The decisive role of zinc species (or other dopants) to activate ethane and
form ethene was further emphasized with results obtained under transient reaction
conditions using a TAP (temporal analysis of products [139]) reactor system. This

technique allows a time resolution in the milliseconds range. The application of
low reactant concentrations (in the range of 1015 molecules per pulse) limits bimo-
lecular reactions, reactions of intermediates, and deactivation. In a standard TAP
experiment, a pulse containing a deﬁned number of molecules of a reactant and
an inert element traverses through the evacuated catalyst zone. A time-resolved
answer signal is obtained on a mass-spectrometric detector. The shape and inten-
sity of this signal can be used to evaluate adsorption, desorption, or reaction ki-
netics.
When ethane was pulsed over the evacuated catalyst bed containing H-ZSM-
5 at 773 K, no interaction with the catalyst was observed. Ethane passed through
the reactor in much the same manner as the inert molecule neon (Fig. 9a)
[135,140]. Under the same conditions, ethene was formed on Zn-ZSM-5. This
can be clearly seen when the signal at mass number 30 (originating from ethane)
is subtracted from the signal at mass number 26 (originating from ethane and
ethene fragmentation, Fig. 9b) [140]. The same result was obtained when a Na–
ZSM-5 zeolite was exchanged with zinc ions to exclude (or at least diminish)
interactions between zinc species and neighboring Brønsted-acid sites. Thus,
activation can take place on zinc species but not on Brønsted-acid sites of H-
ZSM-5.
The nature of active sites and their interaction with molecules involved in
aromatization of ethane was the subject of IR investigations [141]. Hydrogen and
ethane were adsorbed on the zeolite at temperatures of 77 and 300 K. The authors
observed a strong polarization of hydrogen on zinc containing H-ZSM-5 repre-
sented by an IR absorption at 3955 cm21 at T 5 77 K, a band that is shifted by
208 cm21 compared to the Raman frequency of gaseous hydrogen (4163 cm21).
This difference is signiﬁcantly larger than the values obtained for the adsorption
of hydrogen on the surfaces of Al2O3 (180 cm21) or ZnO (140 cm21) at the same
temperature [141]. At a temperature of 300 K, however, the band at 3955 cm21 is
diminished considerably. This effect is explained by the authors with a dissociative
adsorption of molecular hydrogen on acid–base pairs of the zinc containing H-
ZSM-5. Finally, at 300 K, a shift of the IR band for the stretching vibration of
ethane from 2990 cm21 (gaseous state) to 2745 cm21 (adsorbed ethane, ∆5 245
cm21) indicates a polarization also for the adsorbed ethane on a zinc containing
H-ZSM-5 zeolite.
In conclusion, a strong polarization and even the dissociation of HEH and
CEH bonds may proceed on zinc centers in contact with basic lattice oxygen of
the zeolite. Molecular hydrogen can be released from chemisorbed ethane, simi-
larly to observations made for the aromatization of propane on gallium containing
ZSM-5 zeolites [132,142,143].
In conventional plug ﬂow reactors, the residence time of ethane on Zn-ZSM-
5 was varied at constant zinc content. To resolve single reaction steps, low catalyst
weights (giving short residence times) and dilution of ethane were applied. Under
these conditions, ethene was the initial product formed. Its yield passed through
a maximum at very low residence time (Fig. 10a [144]). Second, C4 hydrocarbons

appeared in the product stream. In Table 7, the successive formation of linear
C4 oleﬁns, branched C4 oleﬁns, and, eventually, C4 parafﬁns on Zn-ZSM-5 is
demonstrated [144]. In parallel, benzene was formed as the ﬁrst aromatic hydro-
carbon, followed by toluene and C8 aromatics (Fig. 10b [144]). These observations
differ from results obtained for the reaction of ethane on zinc-free H-ZSM-5,
where linear and branched C4 oleﬁns and, on the other hand, benzene and toluene
appeared at the same residence times in the product stream (Fig. 11, Table 7

[144]), indicating fast interconversion among oligomeric oleﬁns by, for example,
isomerization and cracking reactions. It must be noted that all reactions on the
way to the formation of aromatics (oligomerization, cyclization, etc.) can also
proceed entirely on zinc centers, as shown by using a proton-free zinc-modiﬁed
ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst [121]. A further interesting topic is to investigate whether
the reaction can be directed to the selective production of C4 oleﬁns or other
intermediates.

The optimal concentration of zinc is also critical for aromatization. A high
activity and selectivity for the formation of aromatics is observed using a
ZSM-5 zeolite where half the protons were exchanged by zinc ions [100]. Fur-
ther increasing the zinc content, thus also forming a ZnO phase, favored the
formation of methane and higher aromatics as naphthalene and homologs without
changing the overall activity [102].
Kinetic investigations of the ethane conversion on cadmium and gallium
containing ZSM-5 zeolites at 823 K were undertaken by Bandiera and Ben Taa
ˆrit
[145]. The authors formulated the following proposal: (1) Dehydrogenation of
ethane to give ethene and subsequent reactions of ethene leading to aromatization
are consecutive reactions competing for the same active centers; (2) when the
aromatization activity of a catalyst is improved (e.g., by the addition of promoters
like gallium), the number of residual centers for the primary dehydrogenation step
drops down. This is also reﬂected by a decrease of the apparent activation energy
for dehydrogenation. Consequently, the dehydrogenation rate of ethane was de-
pressed by adding an oleﬁn (cyclohexadiene) to the feed as investigated on cad-
mium-exchanged H-ZSM-5 zeolites [146].
Summarizing the action of promoters on H-ZSM-5 zeolites, zinc in particu-
lar, the key step is the activation of ethane, most likely by hydride abstraction,

eventually resulting in the formation of ethene and the release of molecular hydro-
gen. The oligomerization of ethene to C4 oleﬁns and higher species, which remain
adsorbed on the catalyst, is accompanied by isomerization and cracking on
Brønsted-acid sites (Scheme 3). Zinc species on H-ZSM-5 zeolite favor the direct
aromatization, a result also observed for the aromatization of other parafﬁns (e.g.,
propane to benzene and butane to xylenes [147,148]).

STABILITY AND DEACTIVATION OF THE CATALYST
Brønsted- and Lewis-acid sites in modiﬁed ZSM-5 can be subjected to deac-
tivation processes in the course of the reaction. Higher aromatics and polyoleﬁnic
species account for the formation of cokelike compounds blocking active sites
and zeolite channels (e.g., Refs. 149–151). This coke can be removed by careful
oxidation at higher temperatures. The introduction of a second dopant (e.g., noble
metals such as Pd [79]) was proven to reduce deactivation, probably by hydroge-
nation of unsaturated coke precursors, leading to more volatile products.
In addition to coking, gallium and, especially, zinc ions are prone to migrate
out of the catalyst. This process is enhanced at higher temperatures and under
reducing conditions [152], as is the case in the aromatization. Oxidic zinc species
are more likely to leave the catalyst than zinc ions in interaction with the nega-
tively charged AlO4
2 tetrahedrons. Furthermore, a reduction of zinc cations to
metallic, volatile zinc under reaction conditions cannot be excluded. A determina-
tion of the removed amounts of zinc and comparison with the conversion of ethane
as a function of time-on-stream showed that not all of the introduced zinc sites
were necessary to maintain a high activity (Fig. 12a; for a detailed procedure, see
Ref. 78). However, after a certain time on stream, the removal of zinc seemed to
contribute to the decrease of catalytic activity.
The addition of copromoters such as Pd [153] or Ga [154] strongly retarded
the elution of zinc from zinc-modiﬁed H-ZSM-5 zeolites (Fig. 12b). At the same
time, the selectivity was changed in favor of lower boiling aromatics when con-
verting propane. However, no results are given for aromatization of ethane.
Michiels and De Herdt [155] presented a list of patents claiming the stabiliza-
tion of zinc in or at least the retardation of elution of zinc from H-ZSM-5 under
aromatization conditions by addition of certain elements, such as Na, Li, K, P,
As, Sb, Cu, Ni, Ga, and Pd, but none of the proposed systems led to an application
on industrial scale, yet.

Another probable solution could be the ﬁxation of zinc by incorporation into
the framework of the zeolite (H-[Zn]MFI). This method was successfully applied
to the aromatization of propane, eventually after additional modiﬁcation of the
catalyst with noble metals [18,156]. However, for the aromatization of ethane, H-
[Zn]MFI zeolites did not show an activity comparable to that observed using Zn-
[Al]MFI (Zn-ZSM-5) [157].

VI.
OUTLOOK
As presented in this article, the conversion of ethane into aromatic products
could be a powerful alternative to exploit the chemical potential of natural re-
sources and minimize waste efﬂuents in petrochemistry. Based on the current
knowledge, attention to the conversion of ethane should turn from scientiﬁc to
more commercial aspects, as these play a key role in transforming new concepts
from the research level to an industrial application.
To improve the overall economy of the ethane aromatization, several studies
focused on the shift of the equilibrium toward aromatic hydrocarbon formation,
mostly by means of the removal of hydrogen formed during the process [see Eqs.
(1)–(3)]. Besides shifting the equilibrium, the removal of hydrogen can enhance
the selectivity to the formation of aromatics by suppressing the occurrence of
hydrogenation side reactions leading to parafﬁns [142,143]. Two principal meth-
ods can be distinguished: physical and chemical removal of hydrogen.
A palladium membrane containing reactor for the aromatization of propane
was designed by Uemiya et al. [158,159]. It takes advantage of the well-known
effect of palladium, permitting hydrogen to leave the reaction mixture, selectively.
Using the membrane technology, hydrogen could be recovered on the other side
of the membrane or just burnt with oxygen as presented by Borry et al. [160] for
the nonoxidative conversion of methane.
Alternatively, Chetina et al. [81,161,162] added Zr2Fe, an intermetallic hy-
drogen acceptor, to the catalyst. The conversion of ethane was enhanced by three
to six times, depending on the promoter (Pt, Cr, or Zn) on the pentasil zeolite. The
same factor applied to the increase of selectivity for the formation of aromatics.
However, after saturation of the hydrogen acceptor, the activity dropped down to
the starting level of the modiﬁed pentasil zeolite.
Chemical hydrogen removal combines the aromatization process with a hy-
drogen-consuming reaction (preferably also of commercial interest) in one step.
This approach was applied by several groups. The major focus of these studies,
however, was not to improve the economic parameters, but to investigate the reac-
tion mechanism, in particular the steps involving hydrogen by cofeeding well-
known oxidants to lower parafﬁns (e.g., ethane/O2 [85], propane/NO or O2 [163],
propane/O2, CO, or CO2 [164,165]). The coupling of aromatization with the oxi-
dative dehydrogenation of butane on modiﬁed ZSM-5 enhanced yield and selectiv-
ity to aromatics as well [166,167].
However, new problems arise from this approach. It is more complex to
ﬁnd proper multifunctional catalysts and reaction conditions which catalyze both
reactions (i.e., aromatization and hydrogen consumption). Further, undesired side
reactions of the coreactant (e.g., total oxidation in the presence of O2) also have
to be suppressed.
One recent example is the coupling of the aromatization of propane with
the production of syngas from CO2 on zinc-modiﬁed H-ZSM-5 [168]. Transferring

this idea to ethane, Fig. 2 shows the potential, based on thermodynamic calcula-
tions, to increase benzene formation by the combined conversion of ethane and
CO2. Systematic studies were carried out on zinc-modiﬁed ZSM-5 samples. A
slight increase of the selectivity to aromatics after the addition of CO2 to ethane
was found [42]. There is some evidence for two different species accounting for
the activity in aromatization and CO2 conversion: zinc ions at cationic positions
of the zeolite and oxidic zinc, respectively [42].
Considering the promising results obtained on zinc containing zeolites, fur-
ther efforts should be undertaken to avoid or compensate zinc loss during the
reaction. One aspect could be the supply of Zn or ZnO to generate active sites
in situ by solid-state ion exchange and equal the zinc loss during the reaction. As
an alternative to the addition of stabilizing atoms, engineers are requested to de-
sign apparatus (e.g., ﬂuid-bed or moving-bed reactors) where the necessary heat
transfer is ensured and a regeneration of the catalyst is possible by solid-state ion
exchange.
Further investigations aiming at an industrial application of aromatization
should also have as objective the conversion of a multicomponent feed, such as
methane, ethane, propane, butane, and others, for natural gas processing. Such
systems are closer to the practical problem and avoid the separation of an individ-
ual alkane from a pool of others or from an excess of methane. The obtained
aromatic hydrocarbons could be fed into existing pipelines and transported to fur-
ther conventional processing.
Choudhary et al. [169] converted a natural gas to aromatic hydrocarbons
with a selectivity of ,90% and a conversion of 70% at 873 K on gallium con-
taining MFI-type zeolites. Dependencies of conversion and product distribution
were difﬁcult to deduce because reactivities of the participating alkanes differ in
a wide range and all alkanes interfered with each other in the now even more
complex reaction network. This may be exempliﬁed by the apparent negative de-
gree of conversion obtained for methane in the mixture, as this molecule was
formed as a side product in the overall process.
In order to advance to a commercial process, a broad range of factors must
be considered. As an example, applying the CYCLAR process [20] to convert C3
and C4 alkanes on gallium-modiﬁed H-ZSM-5 zeolites, a demonstration pilot plant
was installed in Grangemouth (Scotland) and operated for about 8 years. Today,
two complexes using CYCLAR technology are being built by Sadaf in Saudi
Arabia. Feedstocks will be LPG plus C8 aromatics and toluene to maximize the
production of o-xylene [170–172].
Thus, on-site market conditions strongly regulate the applied technologies.
In the case of ethane, this means that the aromatization process should not only
be effective but also ﬂexible in order to adjust to market situations (e.g., by chang-
ing product selectivities among aromatic hydrocarbons).
Another driving force might be the production and recovery of the hydrogen
released during the reaction [Eqs. (1)–(3)], which is expected to post a strong

growth among all major industrial gases. The obtained hydrogen could be used
in fuel cells for the CO2-free supply of electricity.
