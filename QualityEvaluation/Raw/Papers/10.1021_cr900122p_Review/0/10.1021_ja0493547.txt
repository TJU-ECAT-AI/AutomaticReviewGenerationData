Abstract
We have demonstrated that a bipyrimidinylplatinum−polyoxometalate, [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+[H4PV2Mo10O40]-, supported on silica is an active catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol in water under mild reaction conditions. Further oxidation of methanol yields acetaldehyde. The presence of the polyoxometalate is presumed to allow the facile oxidation of a Pt(II) intermediate to a Pt(IV) intermediate and to aid in the addition of methane to the Pt catalytic center.

The selective transformation of alkanes leading to oxygenated petrochemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids is important for improved utilization of petroleum and natural gas-based resources. In this context, controlled aerobic oxidation of methane is a key research objective. Although methane can be aerobically oxidized to methanol using methane monoxygenase enzymes, the oxidation requires the use of sacrificial reducing agents for oxygen activation. 1 Thus, there is significant interest in nonbiological systems for selective activation of saturated C−H bonds. 2 Particularly enticing is electrophilic alkane activation and oxidation by platinum(II) complexes originally reported by Shilov and co-workers using Pt(IV) salts as the stoichiometric oxidant. 3 In recent years, advances in these Pt(II)- and also Pd(II)-catalyzed reactions have been made from both synthetic (practical) 4 and mechanistic 5 points of view. The mechanistic work can be summarized by a probable catalytic cycle for aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol2 (Scheme 1). The cycle has not, however, been definitively demonstrated, although some alkane4c and methane4d aerobic catalytic oxidation has been observed at high oxygen pressure, usually PO2 > 20−25 bar.
Scheme 1.  Proposed Catalytic Cycle for Aerobic Methane Oxidation Consisting of Electrophilic Activation of Methane (1), Aerobic Oxidation of Pt(II) to Pt(IV) (2), Nucleophilic Cleavage of the Methyl−Pt(IV) Bond (3), and Ligand Exchange (4) Steps
We now report on the synthesis of a bipyrimidinylplatium−polyoxometalate (H5PV2Mo10O40) hybrid complex and its use as a supported (silica) catalyst for the mild, aerobic (50−60 °C, 1−2 bar O2), aqueous oxidation of methane to methanol and then partially further to acetaldehyde (Scheme 2). Although methane has been oxidized directly to acetic acid with SO3, 6 and acetic acid has also been formed from methane and CO and CO2 (methanol over-oxidation products), 7 the significant formation of acetaldehyde without formation of acetic acid has not been previously reported.
Scheme 2.  Bipyrimidinylplatinum−Polyoxometalate Catalyst and the Catalytic Transformation Observed
The catalyst was prepared by the following synthetic sequence (details in Supporting Information):  (a) reaction of 2,2‘-bipyrimidine (bipym) with PtCl2(DMSO)2 to give Pt(bipym)Cl2, (b) methylation of Pt(bipym)Cl2 with Me2SO4 at one of the non-coordinated aromatic nitrogen atoms to yield the cationic methylated [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+HSO4-, (c) an anion exchange reaction in acetonitrile between [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+HSO4- and (POM) H5PV2Mo10O40 to yield [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+[H4PV2Mo10O40]-, which was then wet impregnated on a silica matrix. The H5PV2Mo10O40 polyoxometalate was chosen as counteranion to the cationic [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+ species because of (a) its advantageous oxidation potential 8 needed to mediate the oxidation of a Pt(II) complex to a Pt(IV) complex (Scheme 1, step 2) and (b) its ability to very efficiently oxidize hydride species to protons and reduced polyoxometalate that in the presence of dioxygen are easily reoxidized under mild conditions with formation of water. 8,9 See, for example, the oxidation of hydrogen (eq 1).
Oxidation of methane was carried out as noted in Table 1. The results clearly show that there was significant turnover in the oxygen-mediated catalytic oxidation of methane (∼1% conversion) under mild conditions. As is known for these reactions,3 excess acid was also needed. No significant formation of CO or CO2 was monitored (GC−MS analysis of both the gas and liquid phases). No formation of acetic acid was measured. Probably, acetaldehyde is not further oxidized as a result of the mild reaction conditions coupled with the anti-autoxidation properties of the polyoxometalate.10 TEM analysis (1 nm resolution) of the supported catalyst after the reaction showed no formation of Pt aggregates due to reduction of the Pt complex. ICP-MS analysis also gave no indication of leaching of Pt into the solution. An active carbon support instead of a silica matrix was equally effective; hydrophobic silica was an inferior support. Simple Pt compounds such as cis-Pt(II)(NH3)2Cl2 and K2PtCl4 showed no catalytic activity.

a Reactions conditions:  2.88 μmol of catalyst, 2 mL of H2O, 0−150 μmol of acid, 30 bar CH4, 2 bar O2, 50 °C, 4 h in a 14 mL Parr autoclave. TON = moles of products per mole of catalyst.
A key feature of a Shilov-type catalytic cycle is the formation of methanol via a nucleophilic cleavage of a Pt(IV)−methyl intermediate (Scheme 1, step 3), rather than a direct oxidation of an intermediate with O2. Three experiments were carried out that support a nucleophilic cleavage pathway. (i) Oxidation of methane in the presence of HCl yielded 63 μmol of CH3Cl, 11 μmol of CH3OH, 2 μmol of HCHO, and 62 μmol of CH3CHO (48 TON).11 (ii) A reaction in the presence of 18O-labeled water gave 18O-labeled CH3OH, HCHO, and CH3CHO (∼73 ± 3% enrichment).12 Enrichment is reduced due to exchange of H218O with the acid. (iii) Reaction in the presence of 18O-labeled O2 (96.3% enrichment) under standard reaction conditions (Table 1) yielded no 18O-labeled products. Methyl chloride formation in the presence of HCl and the 18O-labeling experiments support a nucleophilic cleavage pathway.13
The significant formation of acetaldehyde is a novel feature of this reaction. A time course profile (Figure 1S) of the reaction showed no induction period; methanol and acetaldehyde were accumulated immediately. The accumulation of formaldehyde was delayed and coincided with the inhibition of the reaction. Also, the oxidation of methane upon addition of 250 μmol of formaldehyde (conditions given in Table 1) was almost totally inhibited.
Conceivable reactions to consider for acetaldehyde formation are outlined in Scheme 3. To gain further insight into these possibilities, various additional experiments were carried out. (i) A reaction with CH4/13CH3OH gave labeled CH313CHO only at the carbonyl position,14 but mostly unlabeled product was formed (CH3CHO/CH313CHO ∼3/1). (ii) In the absence of methane, the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde was very slow (Figure 2S); neither the polyoxometalate nor the [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+ ligand alone showed activity for alcohol oxidation. (iii) Similarly, the oxidation of ethanol was also slow (Figure 2S). (iv) Addition of a small amount of 13CO to a methane oxidation reaction showed no formation of CH313CHO, and only traces of CH3OH (∼1 TON), but no CH312CHO was observed.15
Scheme 3.  Possible Reactions Involved in Acetaldehyde Formation
From the results described above, one can draw the following conclusions. (i) Coupling of methanol and formaldehyde is not likely (Scheme 3e) because addition of 13CH3OH to a reaction yielded labeled acetaldehyde only at the carbonyl position. (ii) A pathway involving oxidative coupling of coordinated methanol and methane to yield ethanol that is then oxidized to acetaldehyde (Scheme 3b) is also unlikely since ethanol is only slowly oxidized under the reaction conditions and ethanol was not observed as an intermediate. (iii) Formation of acetaldehyde by reaction of methane with CO (Scheme 3d) is also improbable since CO strongly inhibited the reaction and such a step has a ΔGr = 12 kcal/mol; other coupling reactions are driven by water formation. (iv) The most likely scenario for acetaldehyde formation is the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde via methanol, followed by its coupling with methane to yield the product, possibly occurring entirely in the coordination sphere of the catalyst (Scheme 3c). Accumulation of HCHO and then CO leads to deactivation (high concentrations of these inhibit the reaction).
The presence of the polyoxometalate in the [Pt(Mebipym)Cl2]+[H4PV2Mo10O40]- hybrid catalyst is key in enabling mild aerobic oxidation of methane and possibly functions to facilitate both (a) oxidation of Pt(II) to Pt(IV) intermediates and (b) the addition of methane (also methanol) to a Pt(II) center by providing a conduit for improved oxidation of intermediate hydride species.
