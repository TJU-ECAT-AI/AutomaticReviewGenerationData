and Fe- 
all indicates that a direct oxidative addi- 
tion pathway exists in addition to a-coordination. 
Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride 
can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex. Conse- 
quently, there must be two independent pathways for 
forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a co- 
ordinatively unsaturated metal: (1) 
direct a-complex- 
ation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by 
intramolecular reductive elimination. It is also inter- 
esting to note that the microscopic reverse of this se- 
quence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal 
also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves 
intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive 
elimination of free olefin! 
Finally, the factors controlling intramolecular acti- 
vation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly 
understood in a general sense. It is still not clear why 
species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ 
(C5Me5)Re- 
(PMe3)2]23C 
undergo cyclometalation whereas 
[ 
(C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)]

The knowledge of the mechanism of action of most 
heterogeneous catalysts remains limited. At the most 
primitive level, 
the overall product distribution is often 
known, but the nature of the catalyst-reactant inter- 
actions remains unknown. In a few cases, a more de- 
tailed proposition of mechanism can be advanced, but 
these propositions remain modest and ineffective in 
comparison with mechanistic details that have been 
developed in molecular organic and organometallic 
chemistry. It must be recognized, however, that, by 
Frangois Garin was born in Saint Germain en Laye, France. He received 
his "Maitrise en Chimie Physique" in 1970 and his Doctorat 6s Sciences 
Physiques in 1978 from the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg. He is 
staff member of the 
CNRS and is interested in the use of surface techniques 
to investigate more deeply the understanding 
of catalytic reactions of labeled 
hydrocarbons performed on supported metallic catalysts.

comparison with strictly molecular systems, heteroge- 
neous catalysts are intrinsically much more compli- 
cated. 
Concerning metal catalysis, the making and breaking 
of C-H and C-C bonds by metal catalysts is a domain 
where our knowledge appears to be rather good (e.g., 
hydrogenation of olefins, skeletal rearrangement of 
hydrocarbons). Although the skeletal rearrangement 
of hydrocarbons on metals has been known for a long 
the main questions arising are the nature of the 
intermediate species responsible for the observed ki- 
netics (various 
mechanisms) and the nature of the sites, 
correlated, for instance, to particle-size  effect^.^ 
A detailed description of the two main classes of re- 
action mechanisms, cyclic and bond shift, can be made 
by the use of carbon-13. Metallacyclobutanes, metal- 
lacarbenes, and metallacarbynes were proposed as

precursors in bond shift and “cyclic isomerizations” of 
hydrocarbons 
on metals! 
These proposed mechanisms 
account for a number of experimental facts: selectivity, 
structural effects, and kinetic data which could not be 
explained previously. 
The proposed species require one or several surface 
metal atoms with high coordination number, such as 
those located on the edges or corners of the crystallites. 
This statement results from extensive work on the re- 
action mechanisms of skeletal isomerization of hydro- 
carbons on metals which led to the conclusions that, on 
large particles of platinum5i6 
and on iridium’ catalysts, 
metallacarbynes are involved in the skeletal rear- 
rangement. On the other hand, a straightforward in- 
terpretation was given for the catalytic behavior of small 
metallic particles of platinum where metallacarbenes 
are involved. 
These species have their equivalent in coordination 
chemistry. As early as 1967,8 
carbyne intermediates 
were suggested. In 1970, Herisson and Chauving 
put 
forward a mechanism of olefin metathesis involving the 
disproportionation of metallacyclobutanes into metal- 
lacarbenes and *-bonded olefins. KirmselO in 1971 
and 
Fischer’l in 1976 have studied and reviewed these 
species. 
As carbenes and carbynes were proposed on platinum 
and synthesized on cobalt,12J3 
Zyade et al.14 postulated 
recently the presence of an alkyne adsorbed species as 
an intermediate in these reactions (hydrocracking, hy- 
drogenolysis, and isomerization). The cleavage of the 
alkyne produces surface carbynes, the driving force 
being a negative charge transfer to the hydrocarbon or 
an activated adsorption of hydrogen on these catalysts, 
which modifies the availability of the surface hydrogen. 
Gault and Rooney have studied catalytic reactions 
with deuterium15 
on cobalt films. Metallacyclobutanes 
and metallacarbenes were invoked to explain the se- 
lective deuterolysis of gem-dimethyl groups in poly- 
methylcyclopentanes with the incorporation of four 
deuterium atoms; surface carbyne species have also 
been implicated. Such cobalt species have analogues 
in homogeneous chemistry. Sutton and Dahl16 
deter- 
mined the molecular structure of the organocobalt 
complex (CO~(CO)~CCH~) 
synthesized by Markby et 
al.,12 
containing an aliphatic carbon atom triply bridged 
to three cobalt atoms. The molecular configuration 
ideally possesses C
,
 symmetry and consists of an apical 
ethylidyne group CH3C 
symmetrically coordinated by 
three Co-C 
CJ bonds to a basal CO~(CO)~ 
fragment.

In 1980, Fritch and Vollhardt, with a trinuclear cobalt 
cluster,13 
described a general synthesis of biscarbyne 
clusters prepared by the direct cleavage of alkynes. On 
the other hand, in heterogeneous catalysis, carbyne 
recombination was postulated for the selective isom- 
erization of methylpentanes on iridium catalysts7 
before 
such species had been isolated. Finally, Schrock et al.17 
and Chisholm et al.l8J9 have seen evidence for this 
dicarbyne recombination reaction represented as 
2M=CR 
(RC=CR) + M=M 
Many bimetallic complexes contain an acetylene 
bonded with the two metal atoms.20 The most com- 
monly observed mode of acetylene bonding is the tet- 
rahedral M2C2

This type of reaction was also 
postulated on large platinum particles and on iridium 
catalysts for the selective dehydrocyclization of al- 
k a n e ~ . ~ ~ ~  
At this stage it is not intended to propose new 
mechanisms, rather, it seems more appropriate to try 
to combine the various past proposals with the intention 
of improving our understanding of hydrocarbon reac- 
tions over metallic catalysts. It is also not the intent 
of this paper to present a review. The reader is referred 
to ref 21-28 for further information on skeletal isom- 
erization of alkanes. 
As a general remark, all the different proposals for 
adsorbate intermediates in the reactions of hydro- 
carbons on metals are very similar.29 Recent work of 
Frennet3Ol3l 
on one side and Green32v33 
on another side 
pointed out two interesting problems relevant to the 
skeletal rearrangement of hydrocarbons. Frennet et 
demonstrated that the coadsorption before rupture 
of the C-C bond surrounded by adsorbed hydrogen 
atoms and hydrocarbon entities is related to the number

of free adsorption sites (or landing sites) in a stationary 
regime, which is a function of the experimental param- 
eters (pHz, 
pHC, 7“). Furthermore, during the reaction, 
recombinations (or nonrecombinations) of adsorbed 
entities w

occur specifically before the desorption step. 
All these factors affect the kinetics and are related to 
the active site, which is a major problem in heteroge- 
neous catalysis. 
Why not consider an active site as constituted by 
metal atoms plus hydrogen atoms and adsorbed hy- 
drocarbon entities? For C-H activation, Brookhart and 
Green introduced an original formalism,% 
proposing the 
term “agostic” 
to refer specifically to situations in which 
a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded simultaneously 
to both a carbon atom and a transition-metal atom, 
such representation M - 
H - 
C differing from those 
proposed in the l i t e r a t ~ r e . ~ l f ~ ~ ~ ~  
This agrees very well 
with the kinetic model proposed by Frennet et al.31 
where a reactive adsorption step occurs, followed by 
reactive surface dehydrogenation steps without any 
release of the sites occupied by adsorbed hydrogen.36 
These new concepts and data led us to reexamine the 
various mechanisms of skeletal rearrangement of hy- 
drocarbons (cyclic mechanisms, bond-shift mechanisms, 
hydrogenolysis mechanisms) on the basis of adsorbed 
species deduced from organometallic concepts and data 
and to think of possible implications of agostic inter- 
actions in transition metal catalyzed reactions of hy- 
drocarbons. 
Approach to the Different Skeletal 
Rearrangement of Hydrocarbons Reaction 
Mechanisms on Metals 
Two basic mechanisms were proposed for the skeletal 
isomerization of hydrocarbons on metals: (a) the 
bond-shift mechanism,34 
Scheme I, which corresponds 
to a simple carbon-carbon bond displacement, as in the 
Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement; and (b) the cyclic 
mechanism,37 
Scheme 11, which involves dehydrocy- 
clization to an adsorbed cyclopentane intermediate, 
followed by ring cleavage and desorption of the prod- 
ucts. In addition to these two isomerization processes, 
when the main carbon chain has six or more carbon

 can occur 
under more severe experimental conditions than those 
needed for the two previous reactions. Finally, hydro- 
genolysis reactions leading to smaller hydrocarbons 
occur as parallel or consecutive reactions (Scheme IV). 
With the use of 13C-labeled 
molecules, we have shown 
that the isomerization of hexanes and pentanes on 
platinum catalysts takes place according to two basic 
reaction mechanisms: the cyclic mechanism is favored 
on highly dispersed catalysts, and the bond-shift 
mechanism is favored on catalysts with large metal 
 particle^.^^^^^ A classification of the various contact 
reactions of labeled n-pentane and isopentane was made 
according to their apparent activation energies as 
mentioned in Table I. A distinction was made between 
two groups of bond-shift  isomerization^.^^ The first, 
including methyl shift and isopentane - 
neopentane 
isomerization, requires the same activation energy as 
hydrogenolysis of an internal C-C bond. The second 
group, including n-pentane - 
isopentane isomerization 
and the reverse reaction, requires higher activation 
energies. 
For a hydrocarbon reaction to occur, it is necessary 
that both hydrocarbon molecule and hydrogen are ad- 
sorbed on the catalyst. The adsorbed hydrogen is itself 
a reactant, but the most important factor that needs 
to be specified in a detailed reaction mechanism is the 
way in which the hydrocarbon is adsorbed. Large 
negative orders versus hydrogen pressure have been 
found for the isomerization of pentanes (Table I)3s-40 
and hexanes.21 One explanation is that the rate-de- 
termining step is the rearrangement of highly dehy- 
drogenated species. But with the kinetic model pro- 
posed by Frennet,31 one does not need to invoke the 
presence of highly dehydrogenated species to explain

the large variations in orders from highly negative to 
positive values obtained for heptane hydrocarbons.36 In 
this model, Frennet et al. assumed that hydrocarbon 
and hydrogen both compete for chemisorption on the 
same “potential” sites of the surface; while hydrogen 
chemisorption requires only one of these sites, an en- 
semble of 2 contiguous free potential sites is required 
for hydrocarbon adsorption. 
In this case, the adsorption-desorption step is written 
CnH2n+2 + Hade + 2s e 
(CnHSn+P,H)ads 
* 
(CnH2n-l)ads + W s  
+ H2 
where Hads 
is a chemisorbed hydrogen atom in equi- 
librium of adsorption-desorption with the gaseous hy- 
drogen, that is associated with an “ensemble” 
of 2 free 
potential sites that were assimilated to the hydrogen 
chemisorption sites.31 W is the difference between the 
number of sites S occupied by the chemisorbed radicals 
and the number of sites needed to form the complex 
(CnH2n+2,H)a+. 
If the adsorption is rate determining, 
the adsorption rate equation is written Rads = 
k,~BHBsZf‘HC. The model of Frennet et al. is in perfect 
agreement with the kinetic results obtained by 13C la- 
beling. 
Proposed Precursor Species for Bond-Shift and 
Cyclic Mechanisms on Platinum Catalysts. 
Bond-Shift Mechanisms. At the beginning of the 
1970s, intermediate species were proposed using as a 
basis gas-phase hydrocarbon structure and deuterium- 
exchange reactions. Anderson,4l 
and RooneSP3 
could explain the bond-shift mechanism by assuming 
respectively the following species: (a) 
a precursor aay 
triadsorbed species evolving to a bridged intermediate41 
as the ir complex of Dewar; (b) an aay triadsorbed 
precursor evolving to an adsorbed cyclopentane inter- 
mediate;42 
and (c) a a-alkyl precursor evolving to a 
transient chemisorbed species having partial double- 
bond character;43 
the complex can first be considered 
as a three-center free radical. However, 
these species, 
which can explain the chain-lengthening or chain- 
shortening reactions without hydrogenolysis, were not 
able to explain a decrease or an increase of the initial 
carbon chain; perhaps the existence of a second mech- 
anism which is less activated must be invoked. 
With the use of labeled C5 
hydrocarbons, it has been 
possible to isolate the various elementary reactions and 
to determine their apparent activation energies. As 
mentioned in Table I, the results in the isopentane 
isomeri~ation~~ 
pointed out that methyl migration and 
neopentane formation have the same apparent activa- 
tion energy as hydrogenolysis of the internal carbon- 
carbon bonds for n-pentane and methylbutane. An- 
other bond-shift mechanism was proposed involving 
metallacyclobutanes and metallacarbene species such 
as those proposed by Herisson et al.9 for the mechanism 
of olefin metathesis. These species exist on large par- 
ticles. The bond-shift mechanism occurring via me- 
tallacyclobutanes is less important on highly dispersed 
 catalyst^^^^^^ such as 0.2% Pt-A1203 catalysts. On the 
other hand, the adsorbed metallacyclobutane complex 
was similar to the trimethylene di-a-complex of plati- 
Acc. Chem. Res., Vol. 22, No. 3, 1989 103 
num, as proposed by Chatt, which was readily formed 
from hexachloroplatinic acid and cy~lopropane.~~ 
Cyclic Mechanisms. With the use of c
6
 labeled 
hydrocarbons and of methylcyclopentane, 
two types of 
cyclic mechanisms were found to occur on metallic 
catalysts. Considering adsorbed methylcyclopentanes 
as intermediates for ring opening, the selective mech- 
anism results in ring opening where the carbon-carbon 
bonds with the tertiary carbon atom are not broken, and 
the nonselective cyclic mechanism leads to an equal 
chance of carbon-carbon bond rupture of all the bonds 
of the C5 cyclic species intermediate. These mecha- 
nisms involving the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes are 
very sensitive to metallic particle size.21 As the mean 
metallic diameter of the particles decreases, the relative 
contribution of the nonselective cyclic mechanism in- 
creases. The selective cyclic mechanism operates on 
large platinum particles and predominates on iridium 
c a t a l y s t ~ . ~ J ~ ~ ~  
The following species were proposed to 
take into account these  result^:^ (a) the nonselective 
cyclic mechanism is due to a 1-5 dicarbene species; (b) 
a 1-5 dicarbyne species is responsible for the selective 
cyclic mechanism; 
the site involved for this mechanism 
is larger than the site for the dicarbene species. 
As these two species have lost four and six hydrogen 
atoms, respectively, Finlayson et al.35 
and Piial et al.45 
have raised some criticisms mainly based on the degree 
of dehydrogenation of these precursor species. The 
former group studied mechanisms of 1,5-dehydrocy- 
clization and isomerization of tetramethylpentane and 
3,3-dimethylpentane on iridium, rhodium, palladium, 
and platinum films. Thus Rooney proposed that these 
precursor species are simply bonded to one individual 
metal atom on the basis of results of deuterium-ex- 
change reactions.46 
Hydrogenolysis Reactions on Platinum and 
Platinum-Based Bimetallic Catalysts 
Hydrogenolysis Reactions on Platinum Cata- 
lysts. Two bond-shift mechanisms and two cyclic 
mechanisms have been attributed to isomerization re- 
actions, one mechanism in each group being favored on 
large metallic particles. Concerning 
the hydrogenolysis 
reaction, an important question arises: Are the hy- 
drogenolysis reactions also structure sensitive on plat- 
inum catalysts? 
To study these reactions we will consider the two 
groups of carbon-carbon bond ruptures introduced 
previously by Anderson:26 (a) the C2-unit mode, in- 
volving C-C bond rupture between only primary and 
secondary carbon atoms, noted respectively CI and CII; 
the rupture occurs for the carbon-carbon bonds C&, 
C&, 
and CrCn; 
and (b) 
the iso-unit mode, involving 
rupture between two carbon atoms in which a tertiary 
and/or a quaternary carbon atom is present; C-C bond 
ruptures for the bonds CI-CIII, CI-CIV, CII-CIII, and 
CII-CIV are possible. The difference in the operation 
of these two modes is the number of hydrogen atoms 
present on the carbon atoms involved in the mecha- 
nism. It may also be that different adsorbed precursor 
species are involved for each mode. For the C2-unit 
mode, at least two hydrogen atoms can be removed per

 For this hydro- 
genolysis mode, a a-alkyl species could be involved. 
For the reaction of 2-methylpentane on platinum?47 
the ratios iso/C2 presented in Table I1 are obtained 
from the stoichiometric 
mole distribution of the cracked 
products. The “is0 mode” is equal to the amount of 
propane plus pentane formed, and the “C2 mode” is 
equal to isopentane plus isobutane formed. 
We can see that the ratios iso/C2 
are nearly constant 
as a function of the crystallographic orientation of the 
platinum or as a function of the metallic dispersion 
varying between D = 0.04 for the 10% Pt by weight 
catalyst to D = 1 
for the 0.2% Pt catalyst.21 These 
results show that, on platinum catalysts, the selectivity 
in the hydrogenolysis reactions is not structure sensi- 
tive; the two proposed precursors, a-alkyl and carbene 
species, need the same size for the active sites. 
Hydrogenolysis Reactions on Platinum-Based 
Bimetallic Catalysts. An important question is, Can 
bimetallic platinum catalysts be compared to mono- 
metallic platinum catalysts? Results obtained with 
2-methylpentane are summarized in Figure 1 
and Table

 The data show that the C2-unit 
mode is favored 
on Pt-Ir, Pt-Mo, Pt-Co, and Pt-Ru catalysts, and the 
iso-unit mode is favored on Pt-Ni, Pt-W, and Pt-Pd 
catalysts. 
General Discussion and Conclusions 
All the proposed species discussed until now were 
mainly related to isomerization reactions occurring on 
pure platinum catalysts. For the determination of the 
mechanisms of hydrocarbon reactions occurring on 
metals, two effects are generally assumed: electronic 
(or ligand) and geometric (or ensemble size) effects. It 
is a relatively easy task to identify the ensemble effect, 
but the electronic or ligand effect is more elusive.

orientation initiates specific selectivities, 
as 
for example 
the B5 
sites with the (311) orientation of platinum.47 
Moreover, the selectivity in isomerization reactions is 
a function of the metallic dispersion for platinum cat- 
alysts. This does not seem to be the case for palladium 
or iridium catalysts, however. 
Electronic effects are very important in determining 
the nature of the reaction pathway. When supported 
catalysts of platinum, palladium, and iridium with 
nearly the same particle size (80 A) are compared, the 
nature of the predominant isomerization reaction 
mechanism for c
6
 hydrocarbons depends upon the 
metal; a bond-shift mechanism occurs on platinum, a 
nonselective cyclic mechanism occurs on palladium, and 
a selective cyclic mechanism occurs on iridium.@ These 
results show that reactive intermediate species in the 
various reactions have very different electronic re- 
quirements. 
When these “model reactions’’ 
are performed under 
hydrogen on well-defined 
structures, some experimental 
results are obtained that illustrate how the electronic 
configuration influences the chemistry: (a) From 
studies on single-crystal surfaces, stepped surface re- 
constructions by hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or carbon 
occur.49@ This suggests that new sites with their own 
local density of states may be formed during the cata- 
lytic reactions.49

chemisorption is activated and strong metal support 
interactions on these catalysts lead to a more strongly 
activated adsorption of hydrogen. (c) To understand 
the differences observed between palladium and plat- 
inum, Goddard et al.54 
have undertaken theoretical 
studies on oxidative addition and reductive elimination 
from palladium and platinum complexes. Scheme V 
illustrates these mechanisms. The difference in the 
driving force for reductive elimination from Pd(I1) and 
Pt(I1) 
complexes with the same R groups is very close 
to the difference in the sldg-d10 state splittings of these 
elements as mentioned by Low and Goddard." Thus 
reductive elimination is exothermic from palladium 
complexes, since Pd prefers dlO, and endothermic from 
Pt complexes, since Pt prefers s1d9, 
where the metal 
product is in its d
1
0
 state. (d) Platinum, palladium, and 
iridium show also differences in hydrogenolysis be- 
havior. On platinum catalysts, the carbon-carbon 
bonds are statistically broken; on palladium, the main 
hydrogenolysis reaction is demethylation; and on irid- 
ium, deethylation is favored. 
On monometallic catalysts like Pt and Pd, the relative 
rates for isomerization are much higher than those for 
hydrogenolysis, and the bond-shift and cyclic mecha- 
nisms were interpreted according to the above-men- 
tioned factors: geometric and electronic. However, on 
other monometallic catalysts like Ir and Ru, or on bi- 
metallic catalysts (see ref 7,21,25, a), 
the relative rates 
for isomerization are much lower compared to those for 
hydrogenolysis. Furthermore, the changes in the se- 
lectivity of hydrogenolysis (is0 mode versus Cz 
mode) 
are important from one catalyst to another. For Ir or 
Ru monometallic catalysts, as for bimetallic catalysts 
compared to Pt or Pd monometallic 
catalysts, we think 
that other species can be the activated complexes of the 
adsorbed species proposed previously. 
Then the 
question to be addressed is, How is the Cz-unit 
mode 
or iso-unit mode formed and how are interconverted 
species involved in these two modes? 
Using Frennet's model to interpret the kinetic results, 
the multiple adsorption-dehydrogenation steps can be 
represented as follows: the hydrocarbon and the hy- 
drogen on the surface below it form a van der Waals 
complex or, as shown recently by Brookhart and 
Green,33 
an agostic entity.

R1 
= H, R2 
= sec-butyl for 
metallacyclobutane species and u-alkyl species; (2) R1 
= H, R2 
= n-butyl for cyclic mechanisms. 
Taking these two concepts into account, we propose 
a general mechanism (Figure 2) which can explain the 
following: (a) the differences observed in the hydro- 
genolysis patterns for obtaining branched or linear 
smaller hydrocarbons; (b) the selectivities in the isom- 
erization products. In Figure 2, the agostic species is 
shown as 
the first species adsorbed on the surface. This 
species leads to the precursors a-alkyl for the is0 mode 
or the carbene for the C2 
mode. The relative contri- 
bution of these two precursors is governed by an elec- 
tronic effect. Then a geometric effect leads to the bond 
shift or to the cyclic mechanisms. It can be seen how 
electronic and geometric effects can influence the var- 
ious selectivities obtained on pure platinum catalysts 
or on platinum-based bimetallic catalysts. These 
mechanisms fill the gap between adsorption processes, 
hydrogenolysis reactions, and isomerization reactions. 
These hydrogenolysis precursors have different ap- 
parent activation energies; when the temperature is 
increased, the iso-unit mode is favored, as can be seen 
in Table 1
1
.
 Anderson observed the same behavior.26 
On the other hand, the two hydrogenolysis modes are 
not influenced by the particle size; the same observation 
was made for iridium catalysts by Anderson.26 The 
interconversion between a-alkyl and metallacarbene 
species via an agostic species was proposed first by 
Green33 
and used by RooneY5 
to explain stereospecific 
reactions mediated by coenzyme BIZ. It can also explain 
the superficial migration of dicarbyne species respon- 
sible for the selective cyclic mechani~m.~~ 
Finally, to try to understand the high selectivity for 
the hydrogenolysis reactions where bonds with tertiary 
carbon atoms are not affected, we proposed the for- 
mation on the surface of surface alkynes which are 
cleaved and lead to biscarbyne species.14 Several lab- 
oratories have studied this type of oxidative addition 
and reductive elimination, either from an experimental

can be rationalized with such an agostic precursor. 
Furthermore, the surface reconstructions of platinum 
single crystals by hydrogen correlated to change in the 
selectivity in isomerization and hydrogenolysis 
reactions 
reinforce the proposed agostic precursor. 
More generally, our proposal for an agostic precursor 
species has the advantage of simplifying the interpre- 
tation of the different reaction mechanisms for isom- 
erization and hydrogenolysis via a limited number of 
precursor species. It also allows us to account for the 
first steps of adsorption as 
well on platinum, palladium, 
and iridium catalysts as 
on bimetallic or alloy catalysts 
and agrees very well with the kinetic model proposed 
by Frennet,30 
where a reactive adsorption step occurs, 
followed by reactive surface dehydrogenation steps 
without any release of the sites occupied by adsorbed 
hydrogen.

pointed out the conversion 
of an alkyne complex into a dialkylidyne 
complex either 
from theoretical analysis on cobalt or from experimental 
evidence on rhodium and iridium. If Ru, Co, Ir, and 
Mo behave differently than Ni, Pd, (W), 
it may be, as 
pointed out by Saillard et a1.5s from the plot of relative 
electron distribution as a function of electron count, 
that, at the right side of the transition series, surfaces 
should be negative relative to the bulk, and at the left 
side of the transition series, surfaces should be positive. 
Our general conclusions will then be that possible 
surface intermediates in alkane reactions on metallic 
catalysts have only indirect proof in their support; 
however, they account for many experimental facts. We 
proposed an agostic precursor species which initiates 
the formation of a-alkyl or carbene species to explain

reactions; (b)

Introduction 
High-temperature superconductivity constitutes the 
most sensational discovery of recent times. Since these 
new superconductors are complex metal oxides, chem- 
istry has had a big role to play in the investigations. For 
the first time, stoichiometry, structure, bonding, and 
such chemical factors have formed central themes in 
superconductivity, an area traditionally dominated by 
physicists. These oxide superconductors have given a 
big boost to solid-state chemistry.

The first group of high-temperature superconductors 
discovered' were oxides of the type La2,(Ca,Sr,- 
Ba),Cu04 with T, 
values in the 25-40-K range, soon 
followed by the so-called 123 oxides of the general 
formula LnBa2Cu307 
(Ln = Y, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, 
Er, Tm, or Yb) with T, 
values in the 90-K region. The 
chemistry of these two classes of oxide superconductors 
has been reviewed re~ently.~-~
