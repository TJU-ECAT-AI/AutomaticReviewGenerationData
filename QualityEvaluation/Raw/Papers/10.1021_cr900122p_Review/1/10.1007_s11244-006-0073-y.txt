The activation mechanism of light alkanes is discussed in view of the catalytic properties, and both, bulk and surface properties
of active phases. Among the most efﬁcient catalytic systems, four are examined: VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO and MoVTeNbO. Different
activation processes are proposed depending upon the catalyst used but all have the same H abstracting sites corresponding to O).
The formation of these relatively strong bound species may be related to structure defects (cationic vacancies, excess oxygen) or
they might be created through thermally activated electron transfer. Particular emphasis is given to electrical conductivity
measurements to evidence the presence of these active oxygen species.

1. Introduction
The search of catalysts for the partial oxidation of
light alkanes appears to both industrial and academic
researchers as a diﬃcult but promising challenge in
heterogeneous catalysis. It has been thought that solu-
tions to this challenge could be found by adding an
alkane oxidative dehydrogenation function to alkene
selective oxidation catalysts, which have already reached
a high degree of sophistication in terms of chemical and
phase compositions. However the activation of the C–H
bond of saturated hydrocarbons proceeds under severe
conditions sometimes incompatible with those needed
for a controlled partial oxidation of the alkene formed.
Eﬃcient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based
systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydro-
carbon activation that clearly overcome the activation
step. Although these catalysts have been the centre of
numerous scientiﬁc publications, a clear understanding
of the ﬁrst step of the reaction, the activation of the ﬁrst
C–H bond of the alkane molecule, is lacking.
The complexity of selective alkane oxidation reac-
tions arises from the number of possible simultaneous
reaction pathways, each of them with several reaction
steps occurring on the adsorbed phase without desorb-
ing. All these steps may involve diﬀerent oxygen species
spatially or temporally distributed on the surface. Fur-
thermore the lifetime of the intermediates adsorbed
species formed during the oxidation reaction has been
shown to be relatively long and movement of organic
species, surface modiﬁcation and inﬂuence of co-adsorbed
intermediate species have to be considered [1,2]. The ﬁrst
step of the transformation of the alkane molecule cor-
responds to an oxidative dehydrogenation. If most of
the studies agree on the proposed reaction processes
following this ﬁrst step, they are less clear on the way by
which the alkane molecules are activated. Diﬀerent
pathways have been proposed, but no single mechanism
stands out [3–5]. This may be due to the fact that each of
the proposed mechanisms may be speciﬁc to the cata-
lysts studied or to the reaction conditions. The goal of
this paper is to attempt to propose a common activation
site to several eﬃcient catalysts for light alkane selective
oxidation. We are aware that such an exercise is some-
what speculative, but we have taken care to relate our
proposal to the accumulated knowledge on these cata-
lysts even if this remains largely incomplete. The general
feature related to the activation of alkanes and the
proposed mechanisms will be presented ﬁrst, then four
catalytic systems, VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO and MoVTeNbO
will be successively examined and discussed.
1.1. General features
It has been widely demonstrated that mechanisms
involved in alkene oxidation are based on the well-
known Mars and van Krevelen mechanism [6,7]. In this
mechanism, hydrogen abstraction with the related
dehydroxylation and oxygen insertion create lattice
oxygen vacancies and induce the reduction of surface
cations. These vacancies are replenished by molecular
oxygen, which reoxidizes the cations by electron transfer

at the surface or within the solid. This implies some
collective properties of the solid surface, in particular,
lattice oxygen mobility and electron conductivity.
Diﬀerent mechanisms have been proposed for the
activation of light alkanes that have recently been
reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with
speciﬁc properties like strong Bro
¨ nsted acidity, or strong
Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong
electrophilic species like O) or O2
). The properties of these
species do not ﬁt with those required for eﬃcient alkene
oxidation like long-range electron delocalization and high
electron mobility. Furthermore their presence in oxida-
tion catalysts should be related to structure defects like
cations with diﬀerent oxidation state or vacancies. Very
early it has been proposed that the alkane activation sites
were related to structure defects [8,9]. Although it has
been demonstrated today that the concept of localized
active sites should be taken with caution because of the
dynamic character of a catalytic oxide surface, attempts
to model an alkane activation site should take into
account the defective nature of the solid, which remains
localized. It appears that such an approach should be
restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete mod-
eling of the reaction process would necessitate to
encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed
species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters
of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12].
When attempting to describe a reaction mechanism,
bulk properties are often neglected since they may not
lead directly to a catalytic site description and cannot
systematically account for surface properties. However
among these properties, electrical conductivity should
be considered diﬀerently. Firstly because electrical con-
ductivity measurements when conducted on powders
characterize the surface conductivity of the grains rather
than the bulk and secondly because they can provide
information on the existence of oxidizing species (ion-
osorbed oxygen species, active surface anions,...) and the
nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reac-
tions. They appear very eﬃcient when focusing on the
activation of alkanes since they characterize the struc-
ture defects and help identifying the active oxygen spe-
cies. A review has recently been published by Herrmann
[13] that stressed the importance of the technique and
reviewed some of its applications to catalysts study.
Since electrical conductivity measurements are presented
in the paper, some general features may be summarized.
Oxides for catalytic oxidation are intrinsic semicon-
ductor oxides either of type p or n. The mass and charge
transport in the solid is determined by charge concen-
tration, mobility of carriers and boundary conditions.
The electrical conductivity can be expressed as:
r ¼ elhp þ elen
ð1Þ
where e denotes the charge of electron, l the electrons
(e) or holes (h) mobility and n and p the electron and
hole concentration. The conduction mechanism can be
identiﬁed by perturbing the charge carrier concentration
using O2 as a probe. @r=@PO2 is positive for p-type semi-
conductor and negative for n-type. p-type semi-con-
ductors are characterized by an excess of lattice O2)
anions, Mx+O(x/2)
2)
i.e., cationic vacancies in closed-
packed
oxide
structures.
n-type
semiconductors
are characterized by a deﬁcit in lattice O2) anions
Mx+O(x/2)
2)
accounted for by the existence of anionic
vacancies VO2. From a chemical point of view a hole h+
corresponds to a O) according to the reaction:
O2 þ hþ ! O
ð2Þ
It is important to recall that these O) species cannot be
only considered as surface species but also bulk species
in equilibrium with O2).
1.2. VPO catalyst for n-butane oxidation to maleic
anhydride
It is agreed by most of the scientists that the (1,0,0)
basal plane of the (VO)2P2O7 phase structure contains
the active sites for n-butane selective oxidation [14,15].
This plane is also by far the most exposed one. The
structure, as it appears in this plane, consists of pairs of
edge sharing VO6 octahedra linked to each other by
P2O7 pyrophosphate groups.
Disorder in the crystal structure has been evidenced
by a variability of the line shape and intensity of the
(1,0,0) XRD reﬂection [16–18]. It has been shown that
the most active and selective catalyst has a tendency to
exhibit such disorder. This disorder has been explained
by vanadyle columnar disorder [19] but also by crys-
talline strain [20] related to the speciﬁc texture of this
phase. More recently Nguyen and Sleight [21] have
shown that it results from the presence of defects, which
could be quantitatively correlated with V5
+ concentra-
tion in the structure. Other studies conﬁrmed that the
presence of V5
+ was a key parameter in obtaining an
active catalyst [22,23]. Recently it has been shown that
an
amorphization
of
the
surface
during
catalysis
occurred and amorphous VPO phase has been shown to
be eﬃcient [24]. The primary activation of the n-butane
molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope eﬀect
studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene C–H
bond.
It has also been proposed that weakly adsorbed sur-
face oxygen species could activate the ﬁrst C–H bond
[26]. However, it has been shown that n-butane could be
activated in the absence of gas phase oxygen and that
lattice oxygen was involved [27]; this proposal was
conﬁrmed by TAP experiments indicating that nearly all
the oxygen incorporated into the oxygenated products
came from the lattice [28]. Several mechanisms involving
diﬀerent sites have been proposed for the ﬁrst step of the
reaction (ﬁgure 1). In the ﬁrst one, the n-butane mole-
cule is dehydrogenated with the concerted removal of
J.-M.M. Millet/Mechanism of ﬁrst hydrogen abstraction

two hydrogen atoms as H) and H+ on an acid–base
VIV–O couple (ﬁgure 1a) [29]. Two other proposed
mechanisms
involved
peroxo
or
superoxo
species
formed by the interaction of a chemisorbed di-oxygen
molecule on a surface vanadium cation with an incom-
plete coordination and Lewis acid properties [30,31]. In
the ﬁrst one, the simultaneous abstraction of two
hydrogens on the g2-peroxo species would occur (ﬁg-
ure 1b) whereas in the second, H abstraction from a
methylene group would ﬁrst proceed to give a surface
hydroperoxide group with the formation of a surface
alkoxide group from the formed alkyl radical on the
adjacent vanadyl group (ﬁgure 1c). The hydroxide
group would then abstract hydrogen from the alkoxide
group
generating
adsorbed
butene
or
2-butanone.
Interestingly, it was reported in this later case that a
V5
+O) site could be formed either by oxygen transfer
between a superoxo site and a free neighboring site or by
direct re-oxidation of a completely reduced site (ﬁg-
ure 2). These species would be active but less than the
superoxo ones [31]. Finally, a fourth mechanism, not
schematized, was based upon the direct interaction of
the alkane molecule with a surface transition metal
cation with the direct transfer of two electrons from the
hydrocarbon to the same cation and formations of a
proton and a carbocation immediately attacked by lat-
tice oxygen to lead to a surface alkoxide [32].
It has been demonstrated that the (VO)2P2O7 phase
was a p-type semi-conductor [33]. Figure 3 shows the
variation of the electrical conductivity of (VO)2P2O7
observed when successively contacted with oxygen, n-
butane and the gas mixture corresponding to the cata-
lytic reaction. The behavior of the solid, which is that of
a p-type semi-conductor, is reversible and typical of a
redox mechanism since the same n-butane/O2 sequences
provide identical variations of r. Furthermore it appears
that (VO)2P2O7 remains a p-type semi-conductor even
under the reducing conditions of a catalytic test. This
implies that even in the presence of surface anionic
vacancies whose formation in the conditions of catalysis
is inevitable, the main charge carrier remains positive
holes. O) chemical species thus are present and should
play a role in activating n-butane. In an oxysalt like
(VO)2P2O7 the defects related to the p-type semi-con-
ductivity can be cationic vacancies or excess of oxides.
Such defects could be schematized as in ﬁgure 2. The
existence of vanadium sites with a vanadium vacancy
(h in ﬁgure 2b) is improbable although the presence of
protons would ﬁt with Bro
¨ nsted sites titration with K
+
experiments showing surface protons concentration
twice that expected from idealized models of (1,0,0)
plane [34] and the presence of vanadium vacancies
would ﬁt with the observation by XPS of a surface P/V
ratio greater than one. An interpretation of XPS char-
acterization of VPO catalysts, proposed that there was
not an excess of phosphorus at the surface as usually
reported but rather a lack of vanadium [35]. Although it
may be diﬃcult to think that the presence of vanadium
vacancies could account exclusively for the P/V ratio
experimentally measured, it could participate to it in a
defective surface. The presence of phosphates or pyro-
phosphates groups at the surface cannot be disputed and
it is now well accepted that they may help in electrostatic
docking of n-butane molecules at the surface and pro-
vide a source of selective oxygen species for further

transformation of activated n-butane. It can be observed
that both sites show the presence of V5
+, which is sup-
ported by many experimental data. The more probable
catalytic site should be that of ﬁgure 2(a) already pos-
tulated [31] and the reaction on this site could involve
two hydrogens abstraction with the formation of two
hydroxyls groups and the transfer of one electron from
the hydrocarbon to a vanadium cation as following:
C4H10 þ O2 þ O þ V5þ ! C4H8 þ 2OH þ V4þ
ð3Þ
The two neighboring close sites would allow two
methylene H abstraction explaining the discrimination
between methylene and methyl C–H bond observed
[25,26]. The reaction could also proceed with a ﬁrst H
abstraction on a O) and the formation of an alkoxide
species.
C4H10 þ O2 þ O þ V5þ ! ðC4H9OÞ þ OH þ V4þ
ð4Þ
In fact, as already proposed O), superoxo O2) or peroxo
species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation
and interconversion pathways exist between these spe-
cies (ﬁgure 4) [31]. The role of a superoxide or peroxo
species had already been proposed in the case of other
light alkanes activation although they should not be
stable in the presence of the alkane as shown for su-
peroxo species by EPR.
Based on calculation and modeling of vanadium
oxide clusters, Witko et al. [36,37] have suggested that a
general feature of C–H activation at the surface of a
transition metal oxide with semi-conducting properties
is that both parts of the cleaved C–H bond become
attached to the surface oxide ions. The protons form
OH groups and the hydrocarbon fragments form alkoxy
groups as demonstrated by an IR study [38]. The
involvement of an alkoxide that should be unstable is
still under debate. Finally it cannot be excluded that the
reaction could proceed without direct reduction of
vanadium cations but with the consumption of a posi-
tive hole of the valence band.
The involvement of O) species for light alkanes
activation has already been suggested from thermody-
namic considerations [39]. It was proposed that the
activation of the ﬁrst C–H bond of an alkane involved
very reactive oxygen that was weakly bound and pro-
posed that weakly adsorbed O) could play that role.
However it has been often stressed that very weakly
bound surface O) promoted the formation of C–C
cleavage and were responsible for total oxidation. It is
important to note that the O) species proposed to be
involved in the activation of n-butane in this paper,
although they present electrophilic properties, should be
more strongly bound and have a much lower mobility.
Furthermore if weakly chemisorbed oxygen species were
involved in the p-type semi-conductivity, they would
induce a dependency of the electrical conductivity on the
oxygen pressure when measured under pure oxygen,
which is not what has been observed [33]. Indeed, the
fact that the electrical conductivity was almost inde-
pendent of the oxygen partial pressure under pure oxy-
gen in the range of pressure studied, could only be
explained by the fact that the source of electrical charge
carriers was independent of the oxygen partial pressure.
The same observation was made in the case study of
titanium pyrophosphate presented later.
There has been no spectroscopic evidence of O) on
vanadium pyrophosphate. It is probable that for the site
described, a dipolar interaction between the paramag-
netic centers (O)–O) or O)–V4
+) prevented their
observation by EPR. The line width of the signals that
would be observed may increase to the extent that the
O) species become ‘‘EPR invisible’’.
Dopants have been shown to inﬂuence strongly the
catalytic properties of the VPO catalysts [40,41]. Since

the texture or crystallinity of the catalyst and thus on the
exposed active planes of the (VO)2P2O7 phase, it is often
diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate between these eﬀects and an
intrinsic modiﬁcation of the catalytic sites. They have
been shown to modify the V4
+/V5
+ ratio as well as the
P/V ratio but no direct interpretation of the eﬀect on the
catalytic sites has been proposed although enhancement
or decrease of the catalyst activity are observed. Among
the dopants, one of the most interesting and eﬃcient one
is cobalt. It allows the oxidation of n-butane to maleic
anhydride to be selectively conducted on the VPO cat-
alyst under fuel rich conditions (n-C4/O2 = 0.6) whereas
the undoped catalyst rapidly deactivates under the same
conditions (ﬁgure 5a) [42,43]. It has been shown that Co
favored a higher V5
+/V4
+ ratio under fuel rich condition
and maintained a higher surface distribution of the V, P
and O atoms [44]. These results, which tend to conﬁrm
that V5+ were necessary to activate n-butane, were not
discussed in terms of active site modiﬁcation.
In fuel rich conditions, the increase of activity should
decrease the surface oxygen content destabilizing the
proposed catalytic sites with excess of oxygen anions or
cationic vacancies. In fact the substitution at the surface
of a V4
+ by a divalent metal like Co2
+ can be balanced
by the presence of a V5
+ and an O) (ﬁgure 5b). This
should lead to a stable catalytic site working eﬃciently
in fuel rich conditions. Other divalent cations could play
the same role if they could enter the structure. However
only two have a suﬃciently small size to substitute to
tetravalent vanadium cations: Co2
+ and Fe2
+. Fe2
+ has
been shown to oxidize to Fe3
+ when introduced as
dopant and appears thus less active [45].
1.3. Tetravalent pyrophosphates catalysts for n-butane
oxidative dehydrogenation
Tetravalent pyrophosphates like ZrP2O7 and TiP2O7
have been shown to be active and selective catalysts for
n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation [46–48]. Two types
of reaction mechanism take place on these compounds.
One takes place on ZrP2O7 at any temperature and
TiP2O7 below 450 C and the other on TiP2O7 above
450 C. These mechanisms are characterized by diﬀerent
activation energies for the transformation of n-butane as
shown in ﬁgure 6.
In the structure of these compounds, each tetravalent
cation is isolated from each other by pyrophosphate
groups. The two most eﬃcient catalysts ZrP2O7 and
TiP2O7 appeared to be p-type semiconductors under air
with positive holes as the main charge carriers like
(VO)2P2O7. They became n-type when contacted with n-
butane [47] (ﬁgure 7). If their conductivities were com-
parable as p-type semiconductors (within one order of
magnitude) they diﬀer by three orders of magnitude
when
being
n-type
semiconductors.
These
results
explained the diﬀerence in catalytic reaction mechanism
encountered on the two solids. The alkane activation
can be related in both cases to the p-type semi-con-
ducting properties of the solids, likely through hydrogen

abstraction by a surface O) species. However on
ZrP2O7, Zr cannot change its valence state easily and the
catalytic site will only abstract one hydrogen forming a
C4H9 radical. The formed radical has to migrate to
another Zr site to similarly undergo a second hydrogen
abstraction to form a butene molecule:

In the case of TiP2O7, the same type of mechanism
takes place below 450 C when Ti cannot be reduced.
However above this temperature, it has been shown that
Ti can be reduced and another mechanism is occurring
that has not yet been completely elucidated. It may be
postulated that the same type of mechanism as previ-
ously described may occur [48]:
C4H10 þ O þ Ti4þ þ O2 ! C4H8 þ Ti3þ þ 2OH
ð7Þ
C4H10 þ O þ Ti4þ þ O2 ! ðOC4H9Þ þ Ti3þ þ OH
ð8Þ
A reaction with an electron trapped at an oxide
vacancy on the surface has also been proposed [49]. It is
interesting to note that a linear relation has been
observed between the rate of n-butane transformation
and the amount of reducible titanium cations by
n-butane in the catalysts determined by EPR. Further-
more O2
) have been identiﬁed by EPR at the surface of
TiP2O7 when O2 was adsorbed at room temperature
after reduction by n-butane at 500 C. These latter
species may be the precursors to the formation of the
active O) species or may also be considered as possible
active species.
The two mechanisms have diﬀerent activation ener-
gies and more importantly the butene-1/butene-2 ratio is
diﬀerent. On ZrP2O7 and on TiP2O7 at low temperature,
the ratio is close to 1.5 whereas it is close to 0.5 on
TiP2O7 at high temperature. In the ﬁrst case, after the
ﬁrst methylene H abstraction, the probability for the
second
H abstraction
is
independant
of the
ﬁrst
abstraction and the probability of abstraction of a
methyl or methylene H is only a function of the relative
abundance of the diﬀerent species (6/4). The same ratio
had already been observed in the case of V/MgO cata-
lysts and was explained by the formation of very reactive
butyl radicals [50]. In the second case, the mechanism
would involve an adsorbed intermediate and the stabil-
ization of 1 or 2-butene is governed by thermodynamics
(1/2).
1.4. VSbO catalysts for propane oxidation to acrylic acid
or ammoxidation to acrylonitrile
VSbO catalysts have extensively been studied for the
ammoxidation of propane into acrylonitrile [51–53]. The
VSbO catalysts can contain several phases besides
VSbO4 such as Sb2O4, V2O5 or amorphous V and Sb
oxides but it is accepted that the active phase is the
VSbO4 phase [52]. Its structure is derived from TiO2
rutile-type, with two Ti4+ cations formally substituted
by one V and Sb cation with a cation deﬁciency related
to
the
presence
of
V4+,
leading
to
the
formula
V4+
0.64V3+
0.28Sb5+
0.92h0.16O4 where h stands for cat-
ionic vacancy [54]. This phase is neither stable under
oxygen nor under catalytic conditions and transforma-
tions occur at least at the surface. In the ﬁrst case V2O5
is formed [55] and in the second case, Sb2O4 [56]. The
addition of dopants like Ti, Al or Fe stabilizing the
active rutile phase appeared thus necessary to achieve
high catalytic eﬃciency [55–57].
The redox properties of the VSbO4 phase have been
studied by electrical conductivity measurements [58].
This phase is an n-type semiconductor with electrons as
the main charge carriers. The study of the changes in the
electrical conductivity during alternative exposures to
propane, oxygen and mixtures of propane and oxygen at
the catalytic reaction temperature showed that it became
a p-type semiconductor after reduction under propane
(ﬁgure 8). This can only be explained by a change in the
structure of the compound, at least in the surface region.
The existence of such irreversible change is supported by

the fact that after the ﬁrst reduction, the solid undergoes
redox cycles that are not reversible and remain charac-
teristic of a p-type semiconductor. Because this change
should be limited to the surface of the solid, it is not
observed by X-ray powder diﬀraction. However, XPS
analyses indicate that the surface composition changes
during the electrical conductivity measurement as well
as during the catalytic test with an apparent surface
enrichment in antimony oxide [58]. The ﬁrst increase in
electrical conductivity under propane is related to that
of the free electron concentration originating from ion-
ized anionic vacancies formation according to the
reaction:

The solid containing both cationic and anionic vacancies
is not stable and a phase transformation should occur
leading to a vanadium antimonate, richer in vanadium
and supporting an antimony oxide, partially coating the
surface:
V4þ
0:642xV3þ

0:92(0:160:5xO4 þ 0:22x Sb2O4
ð10Þ
Since in the rutile type structure of the vanadium
antimonate the V and Sb cations as well as the cationic
vacancies are randomly distributed on the crystallo-
graphic sites, it is diﬃcult to describe a precise catalytic
site for the activation of alkane molecules. However, all
the data obtained show that the active catalytic site at
the surface of the vanadium antimonate could corre-
spond to isolated vanadium species neighboring a cat-
ionic vacancy [59,60]. Such arrangement should induce
the stabilization of O) species allowing the activation of
the alkane molecule. A reaction mechanism has been
proposed that involves such catalytic site and was
written as [59]:
C3H8 þ(VOþSbOV ! C3H6 þ (V
OH þ SbOHV
ð11Þ
SbNHSbþC3H6 þ 3=2O2 ! SbOSb
þ C3H3N þ 2H2O
ð12Þ
In this study, it was proposed that NH3 was apt to
react with Sb–O–Sb next to cation vacancies and that
the formation of Sb–NH–Sb next to the defect site was
advantageous for the N insertion step because of a steric
eﬀect. It can be recalled that it had been established that
antimony moieties are active for the formation of
acrylonitrile, and a bridging Sb–NH–Sb species is
responsible for the nitrogen insertion [61].
When Ti and Fe were studied as substituants, it was
observed that they exhibited opposite eﬀects. Ti has a
negative eﬀect on the activity but a positive one on the
selectivity to acrylonitrile and Fe the contrary [62,63].
The study of the iron substitution at low loading has
shown that Fe3
+ was substituting V4
+ with the forma-
tion of an anionic vacancy for charge balance instead of
V3
+. Fe3
+ should participate to the vanadium isolation
but should not substitute vanadium neighboring a cat-
ionic vacancy that would have led to an unstable
structure. From results of earlier study [64], Ti4
+ should
exchange with all V4
+, including the V cations neigh-
boring vacancies, which would explain the decrease in
activity. It should stabilize the rutile-type phase and
participate to the isolation of vanadium species without
implying
the
formation
of
oxygen
vacancies
thus
improving the selectivity towards acrylonitrile.
1.5. MoVTeNbO catalysts for propane oxidation
to acrylic acid or ammoxidation to acrilonitrile
The MoVTe(Sb)NbO mixed oxides catalysts have
recently been shown to be eﬃcient for the oxidation and
ammoxidation of propane [65]. They typically contain
two phases called M1 and M2. It is accepted that the M1
phase is the only active and selective phase but the M2
may intervene in the case of Te containing phase mix-
tures by synergetically increasing the yield in acrylic acid
or acrylonitrile.
The structure of the active M1 phase has been solved
and its detailed composition determined [66]. It corre-
sponds to a network of MO6 octaedra (M = Mo, V and
Nb) sharing corners or edges (ﬁgure 9a). These octahe-
dra are forming hexagonal and heptagonal channels.
The heptagonal channels are empty and the hexagonal

channels are occupied by tellurium or antimony cations
and oxides forming chains in the direction of the chan-
nels. The oxidation states of the cations in the structure
have been determined and the stoichiometry of the
phase can be written as (AO)2)2x(A2O)xM20O56 with
A = Sb or Te, M = Mo,V,Nb and 0 £ x £ 1 [67,68].
The V/Mo and Nb/Mo ratios can vary, but are close to
0.3 and 0.1 respectively.
It has been proposed that the activation of the alkane
molecule occurred on the vanadium sites located in M7
position in the structure and that the activity of this site
was explained by the resonance form in which vanadium
underwent a charge transfer leading to a surface O):
V5þ ¼ O2¡V4þO
ð13Þ
This O) would be able to perform H abstraction from
the propane molecule at the methylene position to
produce a secondary propyl radical. A second step
would correspond to a methyl abstraction to the oxygen
on a neighboring tellurium cation [69].
The proposal of ﬁrst activation of the propane mol-
ecules ﬁts well with the mechanism type proposed in this
paper for the other catalytic system. The charge transfer
is known to be energetically more favorable as the
coordination of the oxide bound to the metal decreases
and it may be proposed that the vanadium sites neigh-
boring the empty heptagonal channels (M1, M3 or M7
crystallographic sites) could be the sites activating the
alkane molecules. This could explain the importance of
the empty heptagonal channels that are speciﬁc to this
active phase. The charge transfer is localized at the
vanadium site on the surface and the M1 phase is, and
remains in the conditions of catalytic test, n-type semi-
conductor [70]. The direct charge transfer proposed in
Eq. (13) may be not the only way to generate active O)
sites at the surface of the M1 phase. A recent study of
the phase Mo3Nb2O14, which presents a Mo5O14 type
phase structure with pentagonal channels similar to
those of the M1 phase, has shown that although only
Mo6+ were expected to be present to balance the charge
in the structure, Mo5+ were identiﬁed by EPR [71]. This
feature was explained by the existence of a substitution
disorder between Nb and Mo cations and the instability
of the conﬁguration in which l3 oxygen (O l3 in ﬁg-
ure 9b) were bonded to three Mo6+ atoms leading to the
reduction of one of the Mo6+ atoms with the formation
of a hole in the valence band. Taking into account
Eq. (2), this could be expressed by the following equation:
Mo6þ
Nb þ O2 ! Mo5þ
Nb þ O
ð14Þ
In the case of the M1 phase, despite the fact that one of the
three bound cations is preferentially a niobium cation (the
one occupying the center of the pentagonal channel [66])
one may hypothesize that the described redox dispropor-
tion may also occur. However this later pathway should
likely be a minor pathway as compared to the former.
2. Conclusion
In this paper we have tried to discuss possible
mechanisms for light alkane activation and the impli-
cation of structure defects i.e. oxygen anions excess or
cationic vacancies in active sites in several eﬃcient cat-
alysts. Alkane activation involving H abstraction on
surface O) has been proposed without presuming that it
would stand for all types of alkane oxidation catalysts.
In several cases, superoxo and peroxo species can be
present at the surface and generate active catalytic sites.
The O) formation would be related to structure defects
like excess of oxygen anions or cationic vacancies
revealed by the p-type semi-conduction properties of the
catalysts or to charge transfers

that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72]
and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov
et al. [73]. If the possible role of O) species is stressed in
this paper it is only in the alkane activation process and
not in the other reaction steps leading to the formation
of oxygenated molecules for which Mars and van
Krevelen based mechanisms involving nucleophilic O2)
species have been well established and should not be
rediscussed. Further theoretical studies should allow
understanding the properties of all the defective sites at
the surface of alkane oxidation catalysts and conﬁrm
their implication in reaction mechanism.
