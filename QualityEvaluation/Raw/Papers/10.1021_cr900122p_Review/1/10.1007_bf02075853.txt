The addition of K20, Cr203, 
Sm203 or Nb205 to V-Mg-O 
catalyst 
decreased 
both activity 
and selectivity 
in 
propane oxydehydrogenation. 
By comparing these results 
with the characterization data, a relationship between 
propylene 
selectivity 
and catalyst 
reducibility 
was 
revealed. 
The most 
easily 
reduced 
catalyst 
was 
the 
most selective. 
INTRODUCTION 
V-Mg-O catalysts 
are active and relatively 
selective 
in 
the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
[1)4] and butane 
[5]. 
The selectivities 
to alkene are substantial 
the samples with 
vanadia contents ranging from 20 to 70 wt.%. While catalytic 
properties 
and structural 
aspects 
of mixed V-Mg ~oxides have 
been 
studied 
in 
considerable 
detail, 
information 
on 
the 
performance 
of promoters 
added to them is rather scanty and 
contradictory. 
It 
has 
been 
reported 
in ref. 
[6] 
that 
the 
addition of 2 wt.% Cr203 or MoO 
3 enhanced the activity of the 
catalyst in 
butane 
oxidation, 
while 
TiO 
2 
increased 
the 
dehydrogenation 
selectivity. 
A later paper 
[7] has reported, 
however, 
that V-Mg oxides containing from 1.9 to 49 wt.% MoO 
3 
showed, in the same reaction, a catalytic behavior that closely

resembled that of unmodified V-Mg oxide. A 
detrimental 
effect 
of the presence of residual potassium in Mg vanadates 
on the 
dehydrogenation selectivity, 
especially in the butane reaction, 
has been established in ref. [8]. 
In this investigation, 
the effect of the addition of some 
metal oxides (K20, Cr203 Sm203 and Nb205) a to V-Mg-O catalyst 
has been studied. We report here the results for the oxidation 
of propane on modified samples and the comparison of them with 
data on physicochemical 
characterization of catalysts. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
All 
catalysts 
were 
prepared 
using 
the 
impregnation 
procedure described elsewhere 
[i]. MgCO 
3 was first prepared by 
adding 
(NH4)2CO 
3 to a solution of Mg(N03) 2. The carbonate was 
then decomposed at 973 K to yield MgO with a surface area of 28 
m2/g. An appropriate amount of this oxide was impregnated with 
an ammonium metavanadate solution and calcined at 823 K to form 
a mixed V-Mg oxide catalyst containing 24 wt.% V205. Its doped 
samples 
were obtained 
by adding 
the required 
amount 
of the 
respective 
compound 
(KN03, 
Cr(N03)3, 
Sm203 
or Nb205) 
to the 
ammonical solution along with MgO. 
Surface areas of the catalysts were measured with a BET 
Asap 2000 Micromeritics instrument using nitrogen as adsorbate. 
X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) was performed on a Seifert XRD 3000P 
diffractometer 
using nickel-filtered 
CuK 
radiation. 
FT-Raman 
spectra 
were 
recorded 
on a Bruker 
RFS 
i00 
spectrometer. 
A 
Nd:YAG laser with an excitation line at 1046 nm and a liquid 
nitrogen 
cooled Ge diode detector 
were used. 
The power was 
usually set at 50 mW. X-ray photoelectron 
spectra 
(XPS) were 
acquired 
with 
a Leybold-Heraeus 
LHS-10 
spectrometer. 
Atomic 
concentration 
ratios 
were 
calculated 
by 
correcting 
the 
intensity ratios with theoretical sensitivity factors. Binding 
energies 
(B.E.) were referred to the adventitious 
Cls peak at 
284.9 eV. Temperature-programmed 
reduction 
(TPR) 
of catalysts 
by hydrogen was carried out with the help of a Perkin Elmer 
thermogravimeter equipped with a TGS II microbalance.

VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-0 CATALYSTS 
Propane 
oxidation 
was 
studied 
in a 
tubular, 
down-flow 
quartz 
reactor. 
SiC 
chips 
were 
placed 
above 
the 
catalyst 
particles 
(0.I g, 0.42-0.59 mm) up to a total bed volume of 1 
cm 
3. A C3H8-O2-He mixture of 4:8:88 molar ratio was fed into 
the 
reactor 
at 
a 
total 
flow 
of 
0.3 mol/h 
and W/F=12.3 
g 
cat.h/mol. 
Under these conditions, 
the homogeneous 
conversion 
of propane was negligible, 
being equal to 0.2 mol% at 773 K. 
Reactants and products were analyzed on-line with a Varian 3400 
GC with a TCD detector. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Table 
1 presents 
some typical 
results 
Of the oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of propane on a V-Mg oxide catalyst 
and its 
samples modified with 1 wt.% of different metal oxides. In the 
temperature range of 673-823 K, the major products were C3H6, 
CO and CO 
2 
. Small 
amounts 
of CH4, 
C2H 
6 and C2H 
4 were also 
produced, 
especially 
on 
K- 
and 
Cr-doped 
catalysts. 
The 
selectivity 
to 
propylene 
decreased 
with 
increasing 
propane 
conversion on all catalysts.

AS follows from this table, 
the original V-Mg-O catalyst 
was more active and selective for propane dehydrogenation than 
all modified samples. 
The lowest selectivity to propylene was 
obtained on a 
K-doped catalyst. This result is consistent with 
the previous 
observation 
by Kung 
[8] that mixed V-Mg oxides 
prepared with the use of K0H showed decreased selectivity 
in 
comparison with the same catalysts prepared without the use of 
KOH. 
Significantly 
lower activity 
obtained 
for the Cr-doped 
catalyst 
contradicts 
the promoting effect of Cr203 in butane 
oxidation reported in ref. [6]. Taking into account that in the 
latter work twice as much of Cr203 was incorporated 
into the 
V-Mg-O catalyst, we prepared a catalyst which contained I0 wt.% 
Cr203 . 
It 
also 
exhibited 
considerably 
lower 
activity 
and 
selectivity 
than 
the undoped 
catalyst, 
thus 
confirming 
the 
deteriorating 
effect of chromium on the catalytic performance 
of V-Mg oxides in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 
The XRD patterns of original and modified catalysts were 
similar, 
showing the presence of only Mg0 diffraction 
lines. 
The presence of Mg orthovanadate or other possible compounds of 
V-Mg-O 
was 
not 
detected, 
probably 
because 
of 
their 
low 
concentration 
in the solid. 
This 
is confirmed 
by the Raman 
spectra of catalysts shown in Fig. i. The V-Mg-O catalyst, 
as 
well as K- and Sm-doped 
samples, 
exhibit bands at 861, 
480, 
-I 
351, 
and 276 cm 
due to the Mg orthovanadate 
phase 
[9,10]. 
This result indicates that the incorporation of small amounts 
of 
K20 
or 
Sm203 
did 
not 
change 
significantly 
the 
phase 
composition 
of the V-Mg-O 
catalyst. 
In the spectrum 
of the 
Nb-doped, 
catalyst, 
along 
with 
the 
strongest 
bands 
of 
Mg 
-i 
orthovanadate 
at 860 and 350 cm 
, new bands were observed at 
993, 674, 629, and 264 cm 
-I due to H-Nb205 oxide [ii] 
. The band 
-i 
at 993 cm 
could be assigned to the presence of supported V205 
as well; however, 
its ether strong bands reported in ref. 
[12] 
were absent. 
For the C 
r-doped catalyst, 
no Raman spectrum was 
obtained because of strong fluorescence.

According to the X@S results, the B.E. for V2P3/2 and Mg2p 
varied 
in 
the 
regions 
of 
517.0-517.5 
and 
49.0-49.4 
eV, 
respectively, 
which were close to those reported previously for 
different V-Mg-O catalysts in refs. 
[3,4]. From these data, it 
can be suggested 
that V 
5+ and Mg 
2+, 
but not 
their 
reduced 
species 
were 
present 
at 
the 
surface 
of 
all 
the 
catalysts 
studied. 
The surface V/Mg atomic ratios measured by XPS are 
listed in Table i. This characteristic was found equal to 0.107 
for the undoped catalyst,which 
is in good agreement with the 
literature 
data 
[1,3]. 
It is seen also that the addition of 
potassium 
or niobium did not affect the surface V/Mg ratio, 
whereas chromium and samarium remarkably increased it. The XPS 
M/Mg ratios for Cr-, Sm- and K-doped catalysts were by factors 
of respectively 
5, 
8 and 20 smaller 
than the corresponding 
nominal ratios. Much lower 
(by i000 times) 
surface dispersity 
was found for niobium which, as shown above, was present in the 
V-Mg-O catalyst as a Nb205 phase. These variations 
in surface 
compositions of the catalysts did not show any correlation with 
either their overall activity or dehydrogenation selectivity. 
TPR profiles of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The 
results show that all samples had only one reduction peak with 
a maximum'varying 
in the temperature range of 812-885 K (Table 
i). Since MgO [i0] and Nb205 
[13] do not undergo reduction by 
hydrogen 
at these 
temperatures 
but V205 
[13] does, 
one may 
attribute those peaks to the reduction of vanadium ions. It is 
seen that the undoped catalyst was reduced at lower temperature 
than the doped samples. 
The ease of their reduction decreased 
as follows: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of 
catalysts decreased in the order VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > 
VMgSm, and the dehydrogenation selectivity was like VMg > VMgNb 
VMgSm > VMgCr 
> VMgK. 
Note that there is no correlation 
between the activity and reducibility, 
while the selectivity to 
propylene follows the order reducibility, 
i.e., the most easily 
reduced 
catalyst 
is the most 
selective. 
The same 
trend was 
observed by us when comparing 
the reducibility 
and catalytic 
218 
VALENZUELA et al.: V-Mg-O CATALYSTS 
properties of undoped V-Mg oxides containing different amounts 
of 
vanadium 
[14]. 
The 
parallelism 
in 
changes 
of 
the 
oxydehydrogenation 
selectivity 
and catalyst 
redox properties 
was reported also for the three Mg vanadates 
[I0] and Mo-V-Nb 
oxides 
[13]. If the catalytic reaction mechanism involves the 
redox cycle between V 
5+ and V4+as 
suggested in [2,5], a good 
redox behavior under reaction conditions might be favorable for 
the oxidative dehydrogenation 
of propane. 
The exact mechanism 
by 
which 
catalyst 
reducibility 
facilitates 
only 
the 
dehydrogenation 
reaction remains unknown, 
and further studies 
of this point are needed.
