Silica-supported molybdena has been found to catalyze the partial oxidation of methane to 
methanol and formaldehyde. Nitrous oxide as the oxidizing agent and the presence of water vapor 
in the reactant gas stream were necessary to carry out this reaction at the temperature range of 
480-590°C and a total pressure of 1 atm. Highest turnover rates of methanol and formaldehyde 
were, respectively, 2.24 x 10m4 
and 6.25 x 1O-4 
molec . s-i 
site-’ at 590°C. The rate of methanol 
formation was first order with respect to methane and water, and zero order with respect to nitrous 
oxide; whereas the rate of formaldehyde formation was zero order with respect to all reactants. 
From activation energy measurements it was possible to identify a low- and a high-temperature 
mechanism of formaldehyde formation. Predominant at temperatures below 540°C were the pro- 
cesses leading to parallel formations of methanol (E, = 41 kcal/mole) and formaldehyde (E, = 82 
kcal/mole) from the same intermediate, while at higher temperatures only the consecutive oxida- 
tion processes leading to formaldehyde via methanol with an overall E, of 40 kcaYmole was the 
major route.

INTRODUCTION 
With a C-H (first) bond energy of 104 
kcaYmole and a weak interaction with most 
surfaces that is dominated by dispersion 
forces, methane seems to be the most diffi- 
cult molecule among all organic substances 
to activate. Nevertheless, when it is re- 
acted with water (steam reforming) over 
nickel catalysts it dehydrogenates com- 
pletely to produce CO and Hz by an endo- 
thermic process (I). Its oxidation to the 
thermodynamically 
most stable products, 
CO1 and H20, is also facile. It would be of 
considerable importance if the partial oxi- 
dation of methane to methanol with the in- 
sertion of an oxygen atom could be carried 
out. This appears to be a difficult reaction 
while the further partial oxidation of metha- 
nol to formaldehyde is a facile step and a 
well-researched industrial process (2, 3). 
The methane-to-methanol conversion is a 
thermodynamically 
favorable process and 
in light of the successes obtained with the 
partial oxidation of other small molecules, 
ethylene and propylene, the production of 
methanol from methane deserves serious 
experimental scrutiny. 
The purpose of this work is to investigate 
the possibility of partial oxidation of meth- 
ane under atmospheric pressure conditions. 
The observation by Liu et al. (4, 5) indi- 
cated that partial 
oxidation 
could be 
achieved under 1 
atm pressure by the use of 
nitrous oxide as the oxidant and water va- 
por in the gas stream over a Mo03-SiOz 
catalyst. We have carried out the study re- 
ported here to verify their observation, 
which claimed a 1.9% methane conversion 
at 560°C to formaldehyde and methanol at a 
four-to-one ratio without forming any car- 
bon oxides. By using a set of experimental 
conditions identical to theirs we were able 
to reproduce their observations regarding 
conversion and selectivity at various tem- 
peratures . 
We have considerably expanded the ki- 
netic studies and observed several features 
that were different from those reported by 
Liu et al. (5). We measured the pressure

and temperature dependences of the indi- 
vidual rates of formation of methanol and 
formaldehyde. We observed a first-order 
dependence of the rate of methanol forma- 
tion on the partial pressures of methane and 
water vapor and zero-order dependence on 
nitrous oxide. The rate of formaldehyde 
formation was found to be zero order with 
respect to all reactants. In our temperature- 
dependence measurements, we were able 
to observe two linear domains in the Arrhe- 
nius plots for formaldehyde formation; they 
corresponded to activation energies of 82 * 
4 kcallmole below 540°C and 40 -C 2 kcal/ 
mole above. For methanol only one linear 
regime giving an activation energy of 38 f 4 
kcal/mole could be observed. The activa- 
tion energy value >54O”C temperature do- 
main for formaldehyde was close to a value 
of 42 +- 2 kcal/mole observed by Liu et al. 
(5) for the total conversion of methane over 
the temperature range of 550-594°C. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials. 
The catalyst, 
1.7% Mo03- 
SiOZ, was prepared by impregnation from a 
basic solution of ammonium heptamolyb- 
date at a pH of 11 
.O 
and a subsequent dry- 
ing followed by calcination in air at 590°C. 
The support, Cab-0-Sil grade HS-5 fumed 
silica, had a reported surface area of 350 2 
25 m*g-i. The finished catalyst was pressed 
and sieved to particle size 30-60 mesh. The 
final surface area, as determined by BET 
measurement, was found to be 220 + 5 
m*g-‘. No attempt was made to determine 
the active molybdenum surface area by 
chemisorption measurements. The reactant 
gases, methane (99.9%) and nitrous oxide 
(99.0%); the reducing gas, carbon monox- 
ide (99.0%); and the carrier gas, helium 
(99.9%) were used as received. 
Apparatus and methods. The fixed-bed 
reactor and the continuous flow manifold 
used in this study are schematically repre- 
sented in Fig. 1. The flow of reactant and 
carrier gases were regulated by needle 
valves and monitored by rotameters. The 
requisite amount of steam was introduced 
into the gas stream by passing it through a 
heated-water reservoir. 
The mixed gas 
stream, typically of the molar composition 
0.1 CH4 + 0.35 N20 + 0.35 Hz0 + 0.2 He, 
was led through a Valco six-port switch 
valve before and after passing through the 
reactor to allow for pre- and postreaction 
GC analyses. The entire reaction manifold 
was kept at 120°C to prevent condensation 
of the water vapor. 
The fused-silica reactor measured 35 cm 
in length and 2.2 cm in diameter. The cata- 
lyst bed, supported between pads of silica 
wool, was usually 2-cm thick. The tempera- 
ture was monitored by a quartz-shielded 
thermocouple probe embedded into the cat- 
alyst bed. The exit was made narrow 
enough (2 mm i.d.) to effect rapid quench- 
ing of methanol and formaldehyde. A valve 
assembly was placed at the exit in order to 
direct the exit-gas stream either through a 
cold trap or through the six-port valve. The 
catalyst bed was centered in a 6-in. heating 
zone of a tube furnace, the temperature of 
which could be maintained within 1°C over 
the entire reaction period. The radial tem- 
perature gradient was usually less than 2°C. 
The catalyst was outgassed at 500°C under 
a vacuum of < 100 pm for 1 h. This was 
followed by a reduction in a lOO-Torr pres- 
sure of CO at the same temperature for 1 h, 
at the end of which the reactor was evacu-

ated and adjusted to the desired reaction 
temperature. The reaction was initiated by 
introducing an 80 SCCM flow of the reac- 
tion mixture taking care not to introduce 
any air during the process. One to two 
hours of time was allowed for the system to 
reach a steady-state condition and be ready 
for sample analysis. 
Analytical 
procedure. 
A Hewlett-Pack- 
ard Model 5793A dual-column gas chro- 
matograph, equipped with a thermal con- 
ductivity and a flame ionization detector, 
was used for all analytical purposes. A lo- 
port Valco injection valve was installed in 
line to the reactant gas flow for sample anal- 
ysis utilizing both the thermal conductivity 
and the flame ionization detectors. Separa- 
tion and detection of N2, CO, C02, and 
HZ0 were accomplished with a Carbosieve 
S-II (Supelco) column and a thermal con- 
ductivity 
detector. For CH30H, HCHO, 
and hydrocarbons a Porapak-QS column 
and a flame ionization detector at a sensitiv- 
ity of 5 x IO-i2 AFS were used. For quanti- 
tative analysis the measured peak areas 
were corrected for the molar response fac- 
tors of the various components as deter- 
mined by Dietz (6). The concentrations of 
CH30H and HCHO were determined by in- 
jecting quantitatively 
1.00 to 2.00 ,ul of the 
solution into the GC and matching the FID 
signal with calibration 
curves prepared 
from a series of aqueous standards. The 
methanol standards exhibited excellent lin- 
ear response within the limits of 5 x IO-IO 
to I x lo-’ mole. The formaldehyde stan- 
dards, prepared by dissolving paraformalde- 
hyde and standardized by Romjin’s iodo- 
metric 
titration 
method 
(7), 
showed 
linearity 
with respect to FID response 
within the range of 1 x 10m8 
to 4 x lo-’ 
mole. The methanol to formaldehyde molar 
ratio determined by analysis of the gas 
phase agreed within 5% with that of the so- 
lution phase. 
The rates of production of CH30H and 
HCHO were found by determining the total 
number of moles trapped in the liquid phase 
over a timed interval. The rate was calcu- 
lated as the number of molecules formed 
per second per molybdenum atom. The re- 
ported rate data are based on the assump- 
tion of 100% dispersion of MO, and hence 
set the lowest limit. The usual conversion 
versus contact time approach to kinetic 
studies was found not suitable for this reac- 
tion since selectivity was a function of con- 
tact time. This will be discussed later. 
RESULTS 
Conversion 
and 
selectivity. 
Data ob- 
tained over the temperature range of 480°C 
to 590°C are shown in Table 1. The ob- 
served methane conversion varied from as 
low as 0.06% at 480°C to as high as 2.7% at 
590°C. At 
temperatures 
below 
500°C 
CHJOH was formed almost exclusively. 
Selectivity values were calculated as per- 
centage molar ratios of the individual prod- 
ucts to the molar sum of all the products. 
Above 5OO”C, 
HCHO selectivity continued 
to increase and reached the level of CH30H 
at 550°C. At higher temperatures the car- 
bon monoxide formation became consider- 
able. Over the entire temperature range of 
480-59O”C, there was a gradual tendency 
for CH30H 
selectivity 
to decline and 
HCHO and CO selectivities to increase 
with increasing temperature. It was inter- 
esting to note that even at the highest tem- 
perature studied (59O”C), HCHO remained 
the major product. Small amounts of other 
hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, ethane, 
propane, and butane were also formed at all 
temperatures. They were found to form, 
however, when flowing the same reactant 
gas mixture over hot silica, and thus be- 
lieved to be due to the interaction of the 
reactants with the silica support, and not 
the molybdenum oxide catalyst. 
The threshold temperature for CO forma- 
tion is apparently 570°C. However, it is 
possible that at the low overall conversions 
small amounts of CO that formed at lower 
temperatures escaped detection by the rela- 
tively less sensitive thermal conductivity 
detector. The 540°C temperature appears to 
be a more realistic upper temperature limit

for the sole formations of the desired prod- 
ucts, i.e., CH30H and HCHO. In the sub- 
sequent kinetic order determinations all re- 
actions were therefore carried out at 540°C. 
Dependence of the product selectivity on 
contact time was investigated. As shown in 
Table 2, we found that a longer contact time 
favored the formation of CO and CO2 
at the 
expense of CH30H and HCHO. Based on 
these findings, all kinetic measurements 
were carried out by keeping the contact 
time unchanged at a value of 2.3 s. and 
measuring the rates of formation of CH3OH 
and HCHO directly as described earlier. 
The relationship between contact time and 
conversion cannot be given any kinetic in-

Reaction rates and turnover numbers. In 
order to investigate the change in the cata- 
lyst activity over time an experiment was 
carried out at SO“C, slightly below the tem- 
perature at which considerable loss of 
Moo3 due to sublimation was likely to oc- 
cur. The initial turnover rates were 5.8 x 
10m4 
and 2.1 x 10e4 
molec * s-* * site-’ for 
formations of HCHO and CH30H, respec- 
tively. As shown in Fig. 2, the activity for 
HCHO production dropped by about 40% 
within the first 40 h and then continued to 
drop at a much slower rate to about half of 
the initial activity over the next 5-6 days. 
The activity for methanol production de- 
clined by the same extent over the same 
period of time. Whether these declines in 
activities were due to poisoning or loss of 
Moo3 through volatilization is not clear at 
present. The fact that the selectivity 
is 
changing with time may be indicative of a 
deactivation process more through selec- 
tive poisoning of surface sites rather than 
the loss of molybdenum. No variation in 
rate could be observed when the reaction

was carried out over 8 h, a characteristic 
time period used in most of the kinetic mea- 
surements. The reaction was thus believed 
to be in a steady state. However, the turn- 
over numbers, found to be 205 and 91 for 
HCHO and CH30H, respectively, for the 
period observed, indicate clearly that both 
of these partial oxidation products were 
formed catalytically.

Kinetic orders. Kinetic orders with re- 
spect to CH4, N20, and Hz0 were deter- 
mined at 540°C by following the rates of 
formation of CH30H and HCHO. The rate 
of CH30H formation was found to be 
roughly first order with respect to CH4 and 
H20, and zero order with respect to NZO. 
In the case of HCHO, the kinetic orders 
were zero with respect to all reactants. For 
these measurements, the mole fraction of 
one of the reactants was varied while others 
were held constant. The resulting mole 
fraction vs turnover rate data were plotted 
in the differential form and are presented in 
Figs. 3 through 5, where the slopes repre- 
sent the kinetic orders. 
For the determination of order with re- 
spect to CH4, the mole fractions of N20 and 
HZ0 were held within 0.30 + 0.03 and 0.33 
? 0.02, respectively, while that of CH4 was 
varied between 0.023 and 0.210. It was in- 
teresting to note that at CH4 mole fractions 
>0.09 the kinetic order approached zero. 
For studies of the kinetic order with respect 
to N20, its mole fraction ranged from 0.20 
to 0.40, since lower concentrations tended 
to cause extremely low conversions and ex- 
cessive buildup of carbonaceous deposits. 
The mole fractions of CH4 and HZ0 were 
held at 0.06 2 0.01 and 0.33 + 0.03, respec- 
tively. The kinetic order with respect to

Hz0 was studied by varying its mole frac- 
tion within the range of 0.12 to 0.3 1. Those 
of CH, and of N20 were held, respectively, 
at 0.10 + 0.01 and 0.44 & 0.02. Because of 
the considerable uncertainty in the data, 
the fractional magnitudes of the order have 
been approximated as the nearest integer. 
Temperature 
dependence of the reaction 
rates. Rates of formations of CH3OH and 
HCHO were measured over the tempera- 
ture range of 480 to 590°C. The methanol 
turnover rate had a maximum value of 2.74 
x 10T4 
at 590°C. The formaldehyde turn- 
over rate, measuring 0.11 X 10e4 
at 500°C 
increased monotonically to 6.25 X 10m4 
at 
590°C. As shown in Fig. 6, the Arrhenius 
plot for HCHO indicates two distinct linear 
regimes with activation energies of 40 ? 2 
and 82 f 4 kcal/mole at temperatures above 
and 
below 
540°C 
respectively. 
For 
CH30H, however, the plot is linear up to 
52O”C, above which 
further 
oxidation 
caused the net rate to drop somewhat. The 
estimated activation energy for methanol 
formation is 41 + 4 kcal/mole. 
Possible competing processes. In view of 
the enhancement of CHjOH selectivity by 
HzO, the possibilities of steam reforming of 
CH4 to CO and HZ, water-gas shift reaction 
of CO and Hz0 to produce Hz and the hy- 
drogenation of CO were all investigated 
through probe reactions. No detectable 
amount of H2 could be observed by flowing 
steam/CH4 mixture 
in the temperature 
range of SO-600°C over the catalyst; nei- 
ther was there any detectable water-gas 
shift as tested under the same conditions by 
flowing a CO/I&O mixture over the molyb- 
denum oxide catalyst. The CO/Hz reaction 
under these conditions resulted in the pro-

duction of only Ci-C2 hydrocarbons, but no 
trace of CH30H. In order to determine the 
role of steam, methane oxidation in the ab- 
sence of steam was tried but was unsuc- 
cessful because of coking of the catalyst. It 
was therefore concluded that among other 
things, steam prevented the formation of 
carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst sur- 
face. 
DISCUSSION 
Conversion, 
selectivity, 
and turnover 
rates. The present study was carried out 
under conditions very similar to that re- 
ported by Liu et al. (4, 5). The comparison 
of our results with theirs, shown in Table 1, 
clearly indicates close agreement in conver- 
sion and selectivity at 570°C. It can be seen 
from the turnover rate data in Table 1 that 
methanol formation is a faster process as 
compared to that of formaldehyde. The re- 
versed trend of rate data at temperatures 
higher than 550°C is due to the high rate of 
methanol oxidation 
to formaldehyde, 
a 
process for which Moo3 is a good catalyst. 
Kinetics and mechanism. The rate of for- 
mation of CH30H was first order in CH4 
and HZ0 at lower concentration ranges and 
zero order with respect to these reactants at 
higher concentrations. 
That of HCHO, 
however, did not show any dependence on 
any of the reactant concentrations. From 
activation energy measurements we were 
able to identify a low- and a high-tempera- 
ture mechanism for the production 
of 
HCHO. 
Besides, the high-temperature 
mechanism was characterized by the same 
activation energy, i.e., ca. 40 kcal/mole, as 
that of the CH30H formation. This data 
suggests a consecutive oxidation pathway 
leading to HCHO through the formation of 
CH30H at temperatures above 540°C. The 
production of HCHO at lower temperature 
with an activation energy of 82 kcal/mole 
can be considered independent of CH30H, 
it is a parallel process. The logical 
:b”;;e from CH4 to either CH30H or HCHO 
is not obvious from this study, since no at- 
tempt was made to identify any possible in-

termediate/s, even though activation en- 
ergy data alone suggests the existence of 
one and the same intermediate involved. 
The most plausible reaction scheme, as 
far as can be inferred from the above data, 
is summarized in Fig. 7. This scheme con- 
sists of five steps. In this scheme, MOO,-, 
and MOO, denote, respectively, an oxygen- 
deficient and an oxygen-rich site. Each of 
the five steps shown in the scheme is in- 
dexed by a subscript on the rate constant k. 
The zero kinetic order found for N20 indi- 
cates that it acts indirectly as an oxidizing 
agent for the partial oxidation of methane in 
a manner not unlike oxygen does in the re- 
dox mechanism of other partial oxidation 
reactions (8, 9). In step one, it provides its 
oxygen to the molybdenum oxide catalyst 
to produce an active site where a hydrogen 
atom could be extracted from an adsorbed 
CH4 molecule within its short residence 
time to produce CH30- and -OH groups as 
shown in step two. The activation energy of 
40 kcal/mole can be associated with step 
two involving the formation of the methoxy 
intermediate which governs the chain of 
consecutive processes leading to HCHO 
via CH30H 
at steps three and five. 
Step four, which is the direct formation of 
HCHO from this intermediate and also a 
slow process having an activation energy of 
82 kcal/mole, accounts for the low-temper- 
ature route for HCHO formation. The only 
270 
KHAN AND SOMORJAI 
reason this high activation energy process 
can successfully compete with the lower 
activation energy formation of HCHO from 
CH30H is the smaller concentration of the 
latter at the low-temperature range. This 
plausible reaction scheme is in general 
agreement with a more detailed description 
of the mechanism for this process reported 
by Liu et al. (5). In that study, infrared 
spectroscopic data provided evidence for 
the existence of the surface methoxy spe- 
cies that was shown to react rapidly with 
water at step three to form CH30H before 
any considerable degradation into HCHO 
and carbon oxides could occur. The direct 
formation of HCHO at step four with an 
activation energy of 82 kcal/mole may oc- 
cur through a rearrangement of the surface 
methoxy intermediate by the breaking of a 
second C-H bond. Oxidation of CHjOH to 
HCHO on Moo3 is in fact known to involve 
such a rearrangement process (2). It could 
also be argued that the activation energy of 
82 kcal/mole is for the desorption of HCHO 
from the catalyst surface as the rate limiting 
step, as has been suggested by Pernicone et 
al. (3) in the case of methanol oxidation to 
formaldehyde. Which one of these two is 
actually rate limiting in the present case re- 
mains to be determined, but either way it 
would account for the zero-order depen- 
dence of HCHO production rate on any of 
the reactants. 
The data qualitatively fits the above reac- 
tion scheme that is presented in Fig. 7 if we 
assume that among the five elementary 
processes specified, steps two and four 
have lower rate constants, i.e., kz,kd Q 
k3,k5. Step one, being a fast process, has 
been excluded, for simplicity, from the dis- 
cussion that follows. Assuming a steady- 
state condition for the surface methoxy in- 
termediate, one can write 
d[CH@Hl 
dt 
= & 
[CHdH@l 
- k#ZH30H1. 
(1) 
At low conversions the second term on the 
right can be neglected, so that CHjOH for- 
mation becomes a first-order process with 
CH4. A first-order dependence of CHsOH 
formation on H20 at lower steam concen- 
tration is also apparent from Eq. (1). At low 
steam concentration, step three may be a 
slow enough process to govern the overall 
rate of formation of CHjOH, but above a 
water mole fraction of 0.3 (not shown in 
Fig. 5), the rate of CH30H formation be- 
comes essentially 
independent of H20. 
Likewise, for HCHO at and above 540°C 
where there is an appreciable buildup of 
CH30H and its conversion to HCHO, one 
could formulate 
d[HCHOl 
dt 
= fi 
LCH41 
+ kKHjOH1. 
(2) 
Since k2,k4 4 k3 
,ks, the first term on the 
right in the above equation becomes much 
smaller as compared to the second term, 
which predicts a zero-order dependence of 
HCHO formation with respect to CH4. This 
is consistent with our suggestion made in 
the previous paragraph that a slow step four 
(low k4) would mean a zero-order kinetics 
of HCHO formation. 
No evidence is available from our study 
regarding the oxidation state of molybde- 
num. Liu et al. (4, 5) however, showed evi- 
dence from ESR studies that the oxidation 
state of the active molybdenum species was 
MO(V). Further information regarding the 
molybdenum oxidation state could be ob- 
tained by XPS measurements and the exis- 
tence of CH30 and OH species attached to 
molybdenum oxide surface could be inves- 
tigated by HREELS and UPS techniques. 
These studies are currently in progress in 
our laboratory. 
The difference between the present study 
and the findings of Liu et al. (5) consists in 
the measurement of the kinetic orders. Ac- 
cording to their finding, the overall CH4 
conversion rate was first order with N20 
and zero order with CH4, while our results 
suggest first-order dependence with respect 
to CH4 for the rate of CH30H formation 
and zero-order dependence with respect to

OF CH4 ON Mo03-SiOz

both N20 and CH4 for HCHO formation. 
While the discrepancy of the kinetic order 
with respect to N20 cannot be readily re- 
solved, an explanation does exist for the 
case of the kinetic order with respect to 
CH4. The CH4 mole fraction range of 0.02 
to 0.09 over which we observed the first- 
order dependence was lower than was used 
in their study, which ranged above 0.07. 
According to their data, however, a slight 
dependence of the CH30H production on 
CH4 at the lower CH4 concentration range 
was discernible. Another possible reason 
for these discrepancies may be the temper- 
atures used in the determination of kinetic 
orders. The temperature chosen for the 
present study was 54O”C, at which there is 
no detectable of CO or CO2 production. 
Our concern was the kinetics of formation 
of CH30H and HCHO only. Liu et al. (3, 
on the other hand, studied the kinetic or- 
ders at 580°C under the condition of forma- 
tion of all oxidation products with the over- 
all kinetic order in mind. 
CONCLUSIONS 
It has been shown that methane can be 
partially 
oxidized with nitrous oxide to 
methanol and formaldehyde at maximum 
turnover rates of 2.74 X 10e4 and 6.25 x 
10m4 
molec * s-r . site-‘, respectively, at a 
temperature of 590°C on silica-supported 
molybdenum oxide catalyst surfaces. The 
rate of methanol formation was first order 
with respect to methane and water, and 
zero order with respect to nitrous oxide. 
The rate of formaldehyde formation was 
zero order with respect to all reactants. The 
activation energy of 40 kcal/mole for meth- 
anol formation was found to be the same as 
for formaldehyde at temperatures above 
540°C. This is suggested to be due to a com- 
mon rate-limiting step involving a surface 
intermediate that forms upon adsorption of 
methane, possibly a surface methoxy spe- 
cies, which governs the chain of consecu- 
tive reactions from methane to formalde- 
hyde via methanol. There was evidence for 
the existence of a direct route from the in- 
termediate to formaldehyde with an activa- 
tion energy of 82 kcal/mole. The latter pro- 
cess 
could be observed only at temperatures 
below 540°C. Further studies are needed to 
determine the composition and the oxida- 
tion state of the active molybdenum species 
on the catalyst surface and to identify the 
adsorbates and possible reaction intermedi- 
ates that are thought to be surface methoxy 
and hydroxyl species.
