Abstract
The dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts was studied by a combination of in situ
UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and on line GC analysis. A well-defined set of experiments, based on an
experimental design, was carried out to develop mathematical models, which quantitatively relate Cr-speciation and
dehydrogenation activity with reaction temperature and time, support composition, gas composition and Cr loading. It will

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and
isobutane over supported chromium oxide cata-
lysts has a considerable industrial impact be-
cause it represents a route to obtain alkenes
from feedstock of low-cost saturated hydrocar-

tion is nowadays important because the tradi-
tional sources of isobutane; i.e., steam cracking
and fluid catalytic cracking, are already heavily
used, and the availability of isobutane has be-
come a bottle-neck in the expansion of the
MTBE and ETBE market.
Most characterization studies on supported
chromium oxide catalysts describe the catalyst
structure under conditions often far away from
w x
real catalytic ones 3 . As a consequence, only a
limited amount of information is known about

ment of the active dehydrogenation site 4–8 .
Therefore, research must be directed towards
the catalytic characterization under in situ con-
w
x
ditions 9–11 .
In this work, a novel method has been devel-
oped for deriving quantitative structure–activity
relationships by using the technique of experi-
mental design. It is important to stress that this
technique has been successfully introduced in
the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design
w
x
12–14 , but — to our best knowledge — not in
the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The goal of
this paper is to explore its possibilities and
limitations for studying heterogeneous catalysts.
We have chosen the dehydrogenation of isobu-
tane over supported chromium oxide catalysts
as model reaction because we have studied this
system in great detail in the past. The used
spectroscopic technique is UV–Vis diffuse re-
flectance spectroscopy, which allows to monitor

developed method involves a three-pronged ap-
proach. In a first step, the number of required
experiments was optimized by using an experi-
mental design, and five factors were selected to
describe the dehydrogenation process. Secondly,
both Cr-speciation and dehydrogenation activity
were measured by in situ diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy and on line GC analysis, respec-
tively. In a final step, a mathematical or statisti-
cal model for the optimization of isobutane
dehydrogenation was derived. The obtained
conditions are compared with those used in
chemical industry.

It is important to stress that other factors such as
the possible formation of solid solutions are
equally important. The latter is especially true
for catalyst recycling; however, long-term deac-

this paper, and is therefore excluded. Therefore,
we have limited ourselves to a detailed study of
the influence of the five factors on both the
dehydrogenation activity and Cr speciation.
The values of each of the above-described
Ž
factors can be easily changed between experi-
.
mental limits. The most difficult point here is
to use an appropriate parameter to describe the
support. However, as was shown in previous

publications
3,19,22–24 , it is especially the

chemical composition SiO :Al O ratio of the

support which determines — via its chemical
hardnessrsoftness, solid-state chemistry and hy-
droxyl chemistry — the dispersion, coordina-
tion environment, oxidation state and poly-
merization degree of Cr species. We have cho-
sen the IEP as a parameter to describe the
support composition because the IEP is directly
related with the SiO :Al O

By measuring the catalytic activity for the set
of 30 experiments by on line GC analysis, one
can obtain the response values y in Table 2. It
is important to stress here that the selectivities
towards isobutane were always very high, and
reaches a maximum at around 90–95%. There-
fore, the catalytic conversions as measured by
on line GC analysis in the in situ cell are a good
measure of the catalytic performances of the
supported chromium oxide catalysts. The influ-

the root mean square error; i.e., the standard

measured response values . The quality of the
fit, visualized in Fig. 2, is quite reasonable, but
not perfect because there seems to be some
minor higher-order effects operative. However,
Ž .
Eq.
2
allows to calculate the conditions in
order to maximize the dehydrogenation activity
over supported chromium oxide catalysts. The
following conditions were obtained: X s8; X
1

s7.5; X s2; X s500 and X s10. Thus, a
3

predicted maximum conversion of 5.58% is ob-
tained after 10 min for a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O
2

catalyst at 5008C with a mixture of 2% isobu-
tane in N , which is close to the experimental

Ž .
In order to visualize Eq. 2 , one can make
conversion surface plots, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
For example, Fig. 3A predicts the catalytic ac-
tivity after 30 min for a CrrSiO PAl O
cata-
2
2
3
lyst at 4258C as a function of the amount of
isobutane in N
and as a function of the Cr
2
loading. It is clear that the dehydrogenation
activity gradually increases with increasing Cr
loading and decreasing amount of isobutane in
N . The influence of the reaction time and the
2
Cr loading on the predicted dehydrogenation
activity of a CrrSiO PAl O catalyst at 4258C
2
2

is illustrated in Fig. 3B. It shows a gradual
decrease in activity with increasing reaction
time. The combined effect of the IEP of the
support of the support and the reaction tempera-
ture on the catalytic activity is given in Fig. 3C.
One can notice that at high reaction tempera-
tures the dehydrogenation activity increases with
increasing IEP; i.e., with an increasing amount
of Al O in the support.

Finally, it is important to note that the IEP of
the support seems to be a good measure to
differentiate between the different support com-
positions. This is clear from the results of exper-

DRS spectroscopy
In situ diffuse reflectance spectra were moni-
tored between 200 and 800 nm as a function of
time for each experiment of Table 2. The scan
time was 1 min, and 60 different spectra were
recorded during 1 h. An example of a set of in
situ diffuse reflectance spectra is given in Fig. 4
for experiment N01 and N06. N01 is an experi-
ment with a 0.5 wt.% CrrSiO
catalyst treated
2
at 3508C in 2% isobutane, and the correspond-
ing DRS spectra are given in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4A
shows a gradual decrease of absorption maxima
around 360 and 450 nm with increasing reaction
time at the expense of a new weak band with an
absorption maximum at around 625 nm. The
insert of Fig. 4A illustrates the presence of an
isobestic point, suggesting the presence of two
different Cr-species. By applying principal com-

2 The absorption maxima of the pure compo-
nent spectra extracted by the SIMPLISMA tech-
nique differ from one support to another. In-
deed, as discussed above, the absorption max-
ima of reduced Cr is around 570 nm for
CrrAl O
catalysts, and around 630 nm for
2
3
CrrSiO catalysts. These discrepancies are due
2
to differences in Cr-speciation; i.e., mainly Cr 3q

11,15,16,22–24 ; 3 The noise level of both the
in situ diffuse reflectance spectra and the corre-
sponding pure component spectra increases with
increasing Cr-loading and reaction time. The
former is due to a decreasing amount of re-
flected light from the samples, while the latter is
related with coke formation.
In order to develop a relevant model to relate
the Cr-speciation with the reaction time and
temperature, the gas composition, the support
composition and the Cr-loading, one has to
define the response factor z. We have selected

clear that our analysis does not differentiate
between Cr 2q and Cr 3q, and both are further
referenced as reduced Cr. Therefore, the mathe-
matical model which relate the Cr-speciation
with the factors X will only be semi-quantita-
i
tive.
4.2.2. DeÕelopment of a mathematical model for
describing Cr-speciation
With the same approach as applied for the
dehydrogenation activity, it is possible to relate
the Cr-speciation to the design factors X ,
i
namely the reaction time and temperature, the
gas composition, the support composition and
the Cr-loading. For this response z, a log-trans-
formation was optimal, and the model resulted
in an excellent R2 of 0.95, RMSE of 0.15, and
a F-factor. Thus, a statistically significant model
was obtained, and the corresponding model co-
efficients are summarized in Table 4. The qual-
ity of the model is visualized in Fig. 6, and
shows only a problem with Experiment N20,
which corresponds to a 8 wt.% CrrSiO PAl O
2

catalyst treated in isobutane at 4258C. This can
be due to a higher-order nonlinearity not taken
into account in our model. A physicochemical
explanation for this higher-order nonlinearity
can be found in the fact that for the 8 wt.%

the IEP of the support on the K–M Cr
values at 4258C. It is clear that the band inten-
sity increases almost linearly with increasing Cr
loading up to a value of about 7 wt.%. The
deviation at higher Cr loadings is due to the
inherent limitations of the Kubelka–Munk the-

Based on the results of Table 2, one can also
try to directly relate the catalytic activity with
Cr-speciation via linear regression techniques.
This is illustrated in Fig. 10 for CrrAl O

catalysts, and such analysis is meaningful within
one set of dehydrogenation catalysts because
both the effect of the scattering coefficient S on
the Kubelka–Munk intensity and the differences
in Cr-speciation between different amorphous
supports are now excluded. It can be concluded
— within the limited number of experimental

points — that the catalytic activity response y
is directly proportional with the amount of re-

duction on an alumina support 3,22–24 — but
also by the coking degree, a parameter which
was not directly included in the present experi-
mental design.
Table 2 also allows to relate the dehydro-
genation activity with the Cr-speciation for 4
wt.% Cr-based catalysts treated under the same
conditions, but differing in their support compo-
sition, and therefore differing in their redox
behavior and diffuse reflectance scattering prop-
erties. This is shown in Fig. 11 for experiments

5. Discussion
5.1. EÕaluation of the method
One of the goals of this work was to explore
the possibilities and limitations of an experi-
mental design for the development of quantita-
tive relationships in the field of heterogeneous
catalysis. Generally speaking, there were three
motivations leading to the use of the present
Ž .
design:
1
performing a minimum of experi-
ments to obtain a maximum of information
Ž .
about the dehydrogenation process; 2 search-
ing for interactions between different parame-
ters or factors. Indeed, interactions between the
parameters under study could not be detected by
the classical one-variable-at-a-time approach;
Ž .
and
3
developing quantitative relationships
which, allows us to make reasonable predictions
about the dehydrogenation activity and the Cr-
species involved. It is important to stress here
that
the
developed
model
is
based
on
statisticsrmathematics, and cannot be used to
operate a catalytic reactor nor to obtain intrinsic
reaction constants. Rather, it allows develop-
Ž
.
ment of semi- quantitative relationships which
enables us to use DRS as a sensor to followrop-
timize catalytic activity and to relate this activ-
ity with certain Cr-species. In any case, several
well-established mathematical tests were ap-
plied in order to guarantee that we have ob-
tained statistical meaningful models, which re-
lates catalytic activity and spectroscopic data
with each other.
The performed set of 30 experiments was
Ž .
mainly determined by
1
the factors selected
Ž .
and 2 the chosen borderlines for each of these
factors. The former were selected on the basis
w
x
of literature
1–3
and of preliminary experi-
w
x
ments on n-butane dehydrogenation 11 . The
latter were mainly determined by experimental
limitations; i.e., the temperature limitations of
the in situ DRS cell, and the problem of satura-
(
)

129
tion in the GC analysis. This is the reason why
Ž .
the application domain of Eq. 2 is rather lim-
ited, and that the optimal catalytic conditions
were not reached within the present approach.
This is clear from Fig. 3, which shows no
maximum or optimal dehydrogenation activity.
Indeed, the dehydrogenation activity was still
increasing with increasing IEP, Cr-loading and
reaction temperature, and with decreasing reac-
tion time. Thus, optimal dehydrogenation activ-
ity is expected for a high-loaded CrrAl O
2
3
catalyst working in the temperature range of
550–6258C, and at shorter reaction times. Un-
fortunately, at the present time no spectroscopic
device is available which is able to generate in
situ spectroscopic data on both oxidized and
reduced Cr-species, and catalytic data to over-
span the operational window of an industrial
Cr-based dehydrogenation catalyst. The limiting
factors are here the very high Cr loadings and
reaction temperatures.
By careful examination of the b values of
Ž .
Eq. 2 and Table 3, one can conclude that:
1. There is a positive effect of the Cr loading
Ž
.
X
on the dehydrogenation process; and
2
2. There are positive interactions between the

and the gas composition

, and between the support composition

However, presently is it not possible to give a
detailed explanation of the model coefficients
obtained. Furthermore, the differences between
Tables 3 and 4 suggest that solely Cr speciation,
as deduced from in situ diffuse reflectance spec-
troscopy, will not be sufficient to explain all the
differences in dehydrogenation activity between
Cr-based catalysts. One of the reasons is that
the limited number of experiments did not allow
to distinguish between the individual contribu-
tions of surface Cr 2q and Cr 3q, which makes
an unambiguous determination of the active site
for alkane dehydrogenation impossible. In any
case, Fig. 11B indicates that Cr 3q must be more
active than Cr 2q explaining the increasing de-
hydrogenation activity with decreasing SiO -
2
content of the support.
5.2. Alkane dehydrogenations and the actiÕe Cr
species
Ž .
Eq. 2 allows to calculate the conditions for
maximizing the dehydrogenation activity over
supported chromium oxide catalysts. The fol-
lowing conditions were obtained: X s8; X s
1
2
7.5; X s2; X s500 and X s10. Thus,
3

5
within the limited region of our experimental
design, maximum conversion is obtained after
10 min for a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O
catalyst at
2
3
5008C with a mixture of 2% isobutane in N .
2
The obtained results are in line with literature
results, but because our optimum is located at
the border of the investigated experimental re-
gion, the optimal conditions for isobutane dehy-
drogenation could not be derived from our
model. The optimal dehydrogenation Cr-based
catalyst, as determined by careful optimization
by catalyst manufacturers over the last decades,

is a 13 wt.% CrrAl O
catalyst

promotors which operates at 550–6258C, and is
w
x
regenerated each 10–15 min 1,2 . Summariz-
ing, it is recomforting to see that by applying
experimental design in combination with in situ
DRS spectroscopy and on line GC analysis,
conditions close to those used in chemical in-
dustries were obtained, confirming the potential
of the described approach.
Another comment concerns the catalytic ac-
tive species for alkane dehydrogenations. The
oxidation state of the active Cr-species has been
the subject of debate and controversy for many
years. According to several authors the active
species is Cr 3q, while other authors propose
both Cr 2q and Cr 3q, or solely Cr 2q as the
w x
active species 1 . On the basis of Figs. 10 and
Ž . Ž
.

pseudo- octahe-
dral Cr 3q-ions are actively involved in isobu-

3q
tane dehydrogenation; and 2 Cr
-species are
more active than Cr 2q-species.
Finally, it is important to stress that the de-
scribed methodology could allow to develop an
expert system for a dehydrogenation reactor.
Such system would allow to predict and control
the catalytic activity via direct on line spectro-

scopic measurements. Further experiments with
a high-temperature optical fiber will be under-
taken to substantiate this point.
6. Conclusions
The possibilities and limitations of the use of
experimental design in the field of heteroge-
neous catalysis have been explored by using
supported chromium oxide catalysts as an ex-
ample. A mathematical model, which quantita-
tively relates catalytic activity and the amount
of reduced Cr with the reaction temperature and
time, support composition, gas composition and
Cr loading, has been developed for the dehydro-
genation reaction of isobutane over Cr-based
catalysts. This was made possible by combining
in
situ
UV–Vis
diffuse
reflectance
spec-
troscopy, on line GC analysis, and experimental
designrchemometrical techniques.
Based on this mathematical model, the fol-
lowing conclusions can be made:
1. the catalytic activity is increasing with in-
creasing Cr loading, dehydrogenation tem-
perature and alumina-content of the support,
and with decreasing reaction time and %
isobutane in N .
2
2. the dehydrogenation activity is proportional
with the amount of in situ measured surface
Cr 2qr3q; Cr 3q being more active than Cr 2q.
3. the best dehydrogenation catalyst, as pro-
posed by our model, is a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O
2
3
catalyst operating at 5008C in 2% isobutane
in N . This is similar to the industrial cata-
2
lyst nowadays used in chemical industry.

contains in its columns
the fractional contributions of the pure compo-

number of pure components. S n=Õ contains
the pure spectra. When using in C the observed
intensities of the pure variables in the spectra in
D, S can be resolved by least-squares. The
SIMPLISMA software has been developed by
Willem Windig and runs under MATLAB.
