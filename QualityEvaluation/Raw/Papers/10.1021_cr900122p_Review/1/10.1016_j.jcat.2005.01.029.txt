Abstract
The structure of low-loaded (0.09–0.73 Fe wt%) FeOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by adsorption–precipitation of Fe2+ precursor on sil-
ica (AP) has been assessed by DR UV–Vis and Mössbauer techniques in comparison with counterpart incipient wetness (IW) systems.
Spectroscopic ﬁndings indicate the speciation of the active phase into isolated Fe3+ species, oligomeric 2-d FeOx patches, and 3-d Fe2O3
nanoparticles, characterised by decreasing interaction strength with silica carrier. The reduction pattern of the above surface structures has
been probed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, and a deconvolution analysis of spectra allowed the concentra-
tion of the various surface species to be highlighted. The catalytic activity in the selective oxidation of CH4 to HCHO with oxygen (MPO)
has been systematically evaluated by batch (BR) and continuous-ﬂow (CF) measurements in the range of 400–750 ◦C. Direct relationships
among Fe dispersion and speciﬁc atomic rate of CH4 conversion (FeCH4, s−1) and HCHO formation (FeHCHO, s−1) conﬁrm the superior
catalytic performance of AP systems. After a poor reactivity of “isolated species” and the unselective behaviour of 3-d Fe2O3 particles,
2-d oligomeric patches feature the best catalytic pattern, owing to an optimum Fe–O bond strength. Sintering and surface reconstructuring
phenomena affect the catalyst stability during the MPO reaction.

1. Introduction
The direct conversion of natural gas (NG) streams into
commodity chemical products actually constitutes one of the
hottest topics in catalysis, since potential process routes em-
ploying novel catalytic approaches in combination with low-
cost feedstocks could result in signiﬁcant economic advan-
tages over current technologies [1,2]. Despite the proposal of
many catalysts for the selective oxy-functionalisation of C1–

C5 alkanes in both the scientiﬁc and patent literature [1–12],
a low process productivity still remains the most signiﬁcant
shortcoming for industrial exploitation [1–5]. Furthermore,
the partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates does not obey
some rules for the selective activation of C2–C5 alkanes
[1–5].
Several studies in recent years have indicated a superior
functionality of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts in the partial oxida-
tion of methane to formaldehyde (MPO), though it has
been argued that the structure of Fe3+ centres determines
their activity–selectivity pattern [6–11]. Speciﬁcally, “iso-
lated” Fe3+ moieties assist selective oxidation paths leading

to oxygenated products, whereas Fe2O3 aggregates and/or
(nano)particles mostly yield COx because of a high avail-
ability of lattice oxygen ions driving the further oxidation
of intermediates [6–11]. Then in addition to catalyst formu-
lations involving silica as a carrier of transition-metal ions
(Mo, V, Fe, etc.) [3–9,12–14], stoichiometric compounds
such as Fe2(MoO4)3 and FePO4, in which the counteran-
ion acts as a “spacer” for “isolation” of the active Fe3+
redox centres, were also found to be effective catalysts
for the oxy-functionalisation of CH4 [4,15]. In fact, both
theoretical considerations [2,12] and experimental ﬁndings
[1–12,15–18] convey that a proper catalyst design must en-
sure a high dispersion (e.g., “site isolation”) of suitable
transition-metal ions (e.g., V, Mo, Fe) over a matrix featur-
ing a weak Brønsted-type acidity.
Furthermore, previous studies of the catalyst steady state
by reaction temperature O2 chemisorption measurements
(RTOC) allowed the mechanism and kinetics of the MPO
on silica-based catalysts to be highlighted [2,12,19–21].
According to recognised principles of oxidation catalysis
[2,12,16] and ab initio calculations of the energetic bar-
rier for CH4 activation on the FeO+ complex [17,18], we
developed a formal kinetic model describing in detail the
steady-state conditions and the activity-selectivity pattern
of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts [2,12,19–21]. Because
of the second-order dependence of CH4 conversion and a
ﬁrst-order inverse dependence of HCHO selectivity on con-
centration of active sites, respectively [2,12,21], we pointed
out that process productivity (STY) can be enhanced by a
rise in the dispersion of Fe3+ ions across a silica matrix,
leading to the exploitation of alternative synthesis routes
[2,9–12].
The physico-chemical and catalytic properties [22–32] of
supported iron oxide systems have been widely investigated,
and a peculiar reactivity has generally been documented
concomitantly with a high dispersion of the active phase
[8,23,28,30,31]. A high, although selective, catalytic func-
tionality of FeOx-supported systems has been found in the
SCR of NOx [23,25], in the selective oxidation of benzene
to phenol [31] and ethylbenzene to styrene [32]. That close
relationship between the structure and reactivity of the ac-
tive phase compelled the adoption of special preparation
methods, such as ion exchange [22–24,26–29] and CVD
[25,26,28], to attain a homogeneous dispersion of Fe3+ ions
mostly across zeolite-type matrices.
Therefore, this paper highlights the reliability of the
“adsorption–precipitation” route (AP) [2,9–12] in promot-
ing the dispersion of low-loaded (150–7300 ppm Fe) FeOx/
SiO2 catalysts. A basic assessment of the effects of prepa-
ration route and Fe loading on the speciation and redox
features of the active phase makes it possible to predict in a
detailed way the catalytic pattern of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2
systems in MPO according to the density, structure, and re-
activity of surface FeOx species. The catalytic efﬁciency of
the various surface structures and the occurrence of catalyst
deactivation phenomena are also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
2.1.1. Catalysts
Two commercial “precipitated” SiO2 samples, F5 and
Si 4-5P (Akzo Nobel), were used for the preparation of sev-
eral FeOx/SiO2 catalysts by “incipient wetness” (IW) and
“adsorption–precipitation” (AP) routes, respectively. The
former were obtained by stepwise addition of Fe(NO3)3
aqueous solutions (pH ∼2.5) to powder silica carriers, and
AP systems were prepared according to the following proce-
dure [2,9–12]. An aqueous suspension of powder silica, put
into a three-necked bottle, was kept at room temperature un-
der continuous nitrogen ﬂow (∼100 STP cm3 min−1) and
stirring (∼600 rpm) to remove oxygen, avoiding any further
air admission. Then, an amount of FeSO4 corresponding to
the designed Fe loading was added to the suspension, the
pH of which was gradually raised to 7–8 by dropwise addi-
tion of a concentrated NH4OH solution. The suspension was
kept at the ﬁnal pH value (with stirring and N2 bubbling)
for 1 h, during which the quantitative adsorption (>98%) of
FeII ions was attained. Afterwards, the solid was ﬁltered and
repeatedly washed with bi-distilled water.
Two aliquots of F5 (S1) and Si 4-5P (S2) silica were
subjected to the above impregnation steps without any Fe
precursors in the solution, to obtain respective “blank” sam-
ples.
All of the samples were dried at 100 ◦C and then calcined
at 600 ◦C for 6 h in air. A list of samples, along with the
relative preparation methods, Fe loading (wt ppm), BET sur-
face area value (SABET, m2/g), and speciﬁc surface loading
(SSL, Feat nm−2), are given in Table 1. Sample designations
(F[xxxx]Sy-zz) take into account the silica carrier (S1 or S2),
Fe loading [wt ppm], and preparation method (F[xxxx]Sy-
IW and F[xxxx]Sy-AP), referred to as IW and AP routes,
respectively.
2.2. Methods
UV–Vis diffuse reﬂectance (DR UV–Vis) spectroscopy
measurements were performed on ﬁne powders of the
samples put into a cell with optical quartz walls, perma-
nently connected to a vacuum line (residual pressure: 1.0 ×
10−6 Torr; 1 Torr = 133.33 Pa). The spectra were collected
with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 instrument equipped with
an integrating sphere and Ultra-White Teﬂon as a reference
material.
Mössbauer 57Fe spectra were recorded at room tempera-
ture (20 ◦C) and at liquid He temperature (−269 ◦C) with
both the 57Co/Rh source and absorber at the same tem-
perature. The spectrometer was operated with a sinusoidal
velocity waveform, and the spectra were ﬁtted by superim-
position of appropriate sets of Lorentzian lines, with the use
of MOS-90 PC software [33]. In the case of a magnetic

sextet, an asymmetric Gaussian distribution of the hyper-
ﬁne ﬁeld was allowed for. The resulting parameters, such
as average magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁeld Bhf, electric quadru-
pole splitting QS, isomer shift IS (relative to α-Fe2O3),
Lorentzian linewidth (LW), and resonance area, A, as a per-
centage of the Fe content, are taken into account.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was
performed with a linear quartz microreactor (i.d. 4 mm)
fed with a 6% H2/Ar reducing mixture ﬂowing at 30
STP cm3 min−1, timely puriﬁed of any O2 and H2O. Mea-
surements were carried out in the range of 200–800 ◦C with
a heating rate of 20 ◦C min−1, with an amount of cata-
lyst corresponding to an Fe load of ca. 0.2 mg, to ensure
differential H2 consumption rates. Before measurements
all the catalyst samples were treated in situ at 600 ◦C for
30 min under a 10% O2/He ﬂow. The H2 consumption was
monitored by a TCD connected by a ChromCard (Fisons In-
struments) to a PC for data storage and processing, and the
response was quantitatively calibrated from the TPR area of
known amounts of CuO. Under such conditions, TPR data
were reproducible in terms of both peak maximum position
(±10 ◦C) and extent of hydrogen consumption (±10%).
Modelling of TPR spectra has been performed by de-
convolution analysis of experimental proﬁles by a linear
combination of Gaussian components [34–36], with the use
of the “PeakFit” software package (Jandel Scientiﬁc).
Catalyst testing in the MPO under differential conversion
conditions was performed with a “recirculation batch reac-
tor” (BR) operating at 650 ◦C and 1.71 bar [8,9,19,20], at a
total ﬂow rate of 1000 STP cm3 min−1 (He:N2:CH4:O2 =
6:1:2:1) and with a catalyst sample of 0.05 g, unless other-
wise speciﬁed.
The performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts has been also
evaluated under integral conversion conditions by conti-
nuous-ﬂow (CF) temperature-programmed catalytic reaction
tests in the range of 400–750 ◦C [13], with the use of a quartz
micro-reactor (i.d. 4 mm) containing 0.05 g of catalyst fed
with a reaction mixture (CH4, 20%; O2, 10%; He, 70%)
ﬂowing at 50 STP cm3 min−1, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
The temperature was ramped at rate of 10 ◦C min−1, en-
abling a continuous scanning of reaction stream with a
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermolab, Fisons Instru-
ments) connected to the reactor by a heated (180 ◦C) inlet
capillary system [13].
3. Results
3.1. Characterisation of the “fresh” catalysts
3.1.1. DR UV–Vis spectroscopy
The ﬁrst, though qualitative, evidence of the rather dif-
ferent efﬁciencies of the employed preparation routes in
promoting the iron dispersion on silica carriers stems from
the different colours of the AP and IW catalysts. Whereas
a typical brownish dye of the former signals the presence
of Fe2O3 aggregates at any loading (0.1–0.43 wt% Fe),
AP samples look colourless up to a loading of 0.73 wt%
(F[7300]S1-AP). However, a basic evaluation of the iron dis-
persion on the various catalysts can be made on the basis of
the DR UV–Vis spectra of the calcined samples outgassed
at room temperature (room temperature) (shown in Fig. 1).
Under such conditions Fe ions are expected to have an
octahedral coordination (e.g., six ligands corresponding to
oxygen atoms of the support and adsorbed water/hydroxyls),
and, after the calcination at 600 ◦C, their ON must be +3
[27–30].
DR UV–Vis spectra for the bare S2 (a) and S1 (a′) sup-
ports are shown in Fig. 1A, including also the spectra of
the F[1000]S2-IW (b), F[4300]S2-IW (c), and F[4200]S1-
IW (d) catalysts. In the case of the silica support, a main
band at 42,500 cm−1, two weaker and overlapped compo-
nents at 36,500 and 32,500 cm−1, and a broad tail span-
ning the 30,000–15,000 cm−1 range, are observed (Fig. 1A,
spectrum a). These absorptions can be attributed to charge
transfer (CT) transitions involving titanium and iron ions
contained as impurities [27,37]. Both isolated Ti4+ and Fe3+
in (distorted) tetrahedral coordination located in the SiO2
bulk could be responsible for the main signal at 42,500 cm−1
[27,37]. Notably, isolated Fe3+ ions in a (distorted) octa-

hedral symmetry at the surface of silica particles, where
they can expand their ligand sphere by adsorbing water
molecules, can also contribute signiﬁcantly to this band, pre-
senting a partner component at 36,500 cm−1 [38]. This latter
absorption, however, might also be a monitor of the pres-
ence of surface isolated Ti4+ ions in (distorted) octahedral
coordination [39]. Finally, the shoulder at 32,500 cm−1 and
the lower frequency tail can be attributed to TiOx and FeOx
aggregates, ranging from “cluster-like” species to nanopar-
ticles; the corresponding electronic absorption decreases in
energy as their size increases [40].
For the F[1000]S2-IW sample, the overall absorption
intensity increases ca. 2.5 times, and the spectral pro-
ﬁle is dominated by a broad band with a maximum at
41,000 cm−1, which is asymmetric on the lower frequency
side and is accompanied by a weak tail in the range of
30,000–15,000 cm−1 (Fig. 1A, spectrum b). The main com-
ponent at 41,000 cm−1 is assignable to the most intense
CT band of isolated Fe3+ ions in octahedral coordina-
tion (the six ligands are oxygen atoms of the support and
adsorbed water molecules/hydroxyls), with an associated
weaker partner in the 37,000–35,000 cm−1 range [38,41].
The remaining part of the absorption proﬁle at lower fre-
quency reveals the presence of Fe3+ species in the form
of oxidic dimers/oligomers (38,000–25,000 cm−1) and 3-d
Fe2O3 particles (25,000–10,000 cm−1) [27,42].
The components related to isolated Fe3+ species appear
to be strongly reduced in intensity in the spectrum of the
F[4300]S2-IW sample, whereas the intensity of absorptions
due to aggregated species is signiﬁcantly enhanced, thus be-
coming the dominant feature (Fig. 1A, spectrum c). The
heavy shoulder at ca. 20,000 cm−1 monitors the massive
presence of nanometric Fe2O3 particles, after the spectrum
of a silica-diluted hematite powder with an average particle
size of 3 nm (Fig. 1A; see inset). A corresponding decrease
in absorption due to isolated species indicates that the addi-
tion of large amounts of Fe by IW involves a high degree of
agglomeration of Fe3+ ions.
The effect of the speciﬁc surface area of the silica car-
rier on dispersion of the iron species can be assessed by a
comparison of the spectra of the similarly loaded F[4300]S2-
IW (Fig. 1A, spectrum c) and F[4200]S1-IW (Fig. 1A,
spectrum d) system. With respect to catalyst supported
on S2, the F[4200]S1-IW sample exhibits a spectrum dom-
inated by a complex absorption with maxima at 43,000 and
39,000 cm−1, resulting from overlapping components of iso-
lated octahedral Fe3+ species and octahedral Fe3+ species in
the form of oxidic dimers/oligomers, indicating a better dis-
persion of iron in this case.
For the differently loaded catalysts prepared via the AP
method on S1 silica (Fig. 1B), the DR UV–Vis patterns ap-
pear in any case to be dominated by a main component
located at a frequency higher than 40,000 cm−1, even for a
Fe loading of 0.73 wt% (Fig. 1B, spectrum d). This indicates
that well-dispersed Fe3+ ions in an octahedral coordination
are present on such systems. However, a regular shift of the
absorption maximum from ca. 45,000 to 40,500 cm−1 sig-
nals a rising degree of nuclearity of the iron species as the
loading increases.
3.1.2. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy
The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of the F[4300]S2-IW (A)
and F[7300]S1-AP (B) samples at room temperature (spec-
trum a) and at liquid helium temperature (spectrum b) are
shown in Fig. 2, and the related parameters are summarised
in Table 2. In the case of the Fe[4300]S2-IW sample, the
spectrum at room temperature exhibits a simple quadru-
pole doublet with hyperﬁne parameters typical of trivalent
paramagnetic iron ions in a slightly distorted octahedral
environment (Fig. 2A, a), which is transformed almost com-
pletely into a six-line pattern at −269 ◦C (Fig. 2A, b),
indicating that almost all of the iron is present in the form of
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with an average
size of ca. 8 nm [43]. Although the hyperﬁne parameters of

this magnetic sextet are slightly different from those of bulk
crystalline α-Fe2O3 [44], previous studies on FeOx/SiO2
systems, bearing a higher Fe loading, suggest that this
discrepancy could result either from the nano-size of the α-
Fe2O3 crystals or from an amorphous character of Fe2O3
particles [45].
The spectrum at room temperature of the Fe[7300]S1-AP
sample consists of an asymmetric quadrupole doublet, which
can be ﬁtted with two Fe(III) components with different QS
(Fig. 2B, a), as shown in Table 2. At −269 ◦C, the coex-
istence of a quadrupole doublet and a magnetic pattern is
observed (Fig. 2B, b). In particular, the resonance area of the
magnetic component corresponds to ca. 50% of the overall
spectrum, indicating that only about half of the iron content
is in the form of superparamagnetic iron oxide species.
3.1.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
TPR proﬁles (normalised to the integral peak area) of dif-
ferently loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts, prepared by AP or IW
methods on both F5 and Si 4-5P silicas, are comparatively
shown in Fig. 3. Quantitative hydrogen consumption data,
expressed as the number of H2 molecules consumed per Fe
atom (H2/Fe), signal in any case a H2/Fe ratio close to 0.5
(e.g., 0.42–0.56), thus denoting a “strong” inhibiting effect
of the matrix on the reduction of Fe2+ ions to Fe0.
The inﬂuence of the Fe loading on the reduction pattern
of F[xxxx]S1-AP catalysts is shown in Fig. 3A. The bare S1

silica sample (Fig. 3A, a) features a TPR proﬁle spanning
the range of 400–800 ◦C, which accounts for the reduction
of Fe3+ “impurities” (150 ppm) to Fe2+. From a qualitative
point of view, a main reduction peak with a broad maximum
at ca. 570 ◦C dominates such a spectrum, with other weakly
resolved maxima at ca. 400 and 700 ◦C also present. The ad-
dition of ca. 0.08% Fe by AP (F[1000]S1-AP) yields a rise in
the reduction kinetics at T < 600 ◦C and the appearance of
two resolved maxima at 365 and 490 ◦C. At higher Fe load-
ings, the reduction proﬁles of the FeOx/SiO2 catalysts retain
the qualitative features of the previous system, though peak
maxima shift further to lower T . At the highest Fe loading
(0.73 wt%), the TPR spectrum of the F[7300]S1-AP sam-
ple displays one broad asymmetric peak centred at 409 ◦C
with a tail of H2 consumption on the high-temperature side,
pointing to the presence of several unresolved components
in the range of 500–800 ◦C.
The effects of the preparation method and silica car-
rier on the reduction pattern of similarly loaded (0.37–
0.43 wt%) FeOx/SiO2 catalysts are illustrated in Figs. 3B
and C, comparing the TPR proﬁles of F[3700]S1-AP (b) and
F[4200]S1-IW (c) samples (Fig. 3B) with those of coun-
terpart F[3700]S2-AP (b) and F[4300]S2-IW (c) samples
(Fig. 3C). Like the similar Fe loading (Table 1), the S2
silica (Fig. 3C, a) features a reduction pattern analogous
to that of the S1 carrier (Fig. 3B, a), also resulting in a
H2/Fe ratio close to 0.5. As a rule, IW catalysts (Figs. 3B
and C, proﬁles b) display an enhanced reduction rate at lower
temperature with respect to similarly loaded F[3700]S1-AP
and F[3700]S2-AP (Figs. 3B and C, proﬁles c), whereas,
in comparison, the rate of H2 consumption at T > 500 ◦C
of samples based on S1 silica is systematically higher than
that of counterpart S2, indicating some inﬂuence of the sil-
ica support on the reduction of the active phase, mostly at
loadings higher than 0.1 wt%.
3.2. Catalyst testing
3.2.1. BR activity data
The effects of the preparation method and Fe loading on
the MPO performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts have been
evaluated by isothermal (650 ◦C) BR tests at differential
conversion per pass conditions (τ, 3.3 × 10−3 s). Activity
data, with reference to S1 and S2 silica supports, are pre-
sented in Table 3 in terms of hourly CH4 conversion (Xh, %),
product selectivity (SX, %), reaction rate (µmolCH4 s−1 g−1),
space time yield (STYHCHO, gkg−1
cat h−1), and speciﬁc Fe
atomic rate (s−1) of CH4 conversion (FeCH4) and HCHO for-
mation (FeHCHO, FeCH4 × SHCHO).
Regardless of the preparation method and loading, Fe
addition always results in a promoting effect of the intrin-
sic reactivity of any silica carrier [2,5–8,12,15], though it is
fairly evident that the AP route generally permits a superior
performance in MPO [9–12].
The bare S1 silica runs with an hourly CH4 conver-
sion of 2.7% and a SHCHO equal to 66%, corresponding
to a reaction rate of 2.8 µmol g−1 s−1 and a STYHCHO of
200 gkg−1
cat h−1. The S2 silica carrier, with both higher activ-
ity (XCH4,h, 3.8%) and SHCHO (75%), ensures a STYHCHO
of 310 gkg−1
cat h−1. Normalised to the Fe content (Table 1),

a Catalyst testing at tenfold lower contact time (wcat, 0.005 g).
however, the two silica samples feature analogous FeCH4
(1.05–1.06 s−1) and FeHCHO (0.66–0.75 s−1) values.
The addition of ca. 0.10 wt% Fe to the Si 4-5P car-
rier by IW (F[1000]S2-IW) implies a threefold rise in ac-
tivity (XCH4,h, 9.9%) counterbalanced by a lowering in
SHCHO from 75 to 54%. Though there is a signiﬁcant rise
in STYHCHO (580 gkg−1
cat h−1), the above ﬁgures account
for a decrease in FeCH4 to 0.50 s−1 and, mostly, in the
FeHCHO value (0.27 s−1) with reference to the S2 carrier.
The same amount of Fe (0.1 wt%) put on the F5 silica
by IW (F[1000]S1-IW) attains a similar effect on activity
(XCH4,h, 8.6%) and selectivity (SHCHO, 55%), also in terms
of FeCH4 and FeHCHO (Table 3). The addition of 0.43 wt%
Fe to S2 silica, still by the IW route, has a strongly neg-
ative impact on the MPO functionality of the FeOx/SiO2
system, as the F[4300]S2-IW attains a Xh of 7.8%, result-
ing in a very low FeCH4 value (0.14 s−1), coupled to a
SHCHO of 47%. These ﬁgures account for a STYHCHO of
only 405 gkg−1
cat h−1 and a FeHCHO value (0.06 s−1) that
is lower by about one order of magnitude than that of the
F[1000]S2-IW sample.
The F[1000]S1-AP catalyst, bearing 0.1 wt% Fe on F5
silica by AP, is much more active (Xh, 14.6%) and se-
lective (SHCHO, 63%) than previous ones, featuring FeCH4
(0.84 s−1) and FeHCHO (0.53 s−1) values comparable to
those of silica carriers and attaining a remarkable STYHCHO
of 1,020 gkg−1
cat h−1. A Fe content (3700 ppm) similar to
that of the F[4300]S2-IW sample, added to S2 silica by
AP (F[3700]S2-AP), yields an activity (Xh, 37.2%) ﬁve-
fold larger than that of the counterpart IW sample, cor-
responding to an FeCH4 value of 0.57 s−1. In spite of
the “high” conversion level, this catalyst ensures a SHCHO
of 33%, accounting for a STYHCHO of 1350 gkg−1
cat h−1 and
a FeHCHO value of 0.19 s−1. With FeCH4 (0.53 s−1), FeHCHO
(0.19 s−1), and STYHCHO (1360 gkg−1
cat h−1) values com-
parable to those of the homologous F[3700]S2-AP, activity
data for the F[3700]S1-AP system conﬁrm a slight, if any,
effect of the silica carrier on activity, also at higher loading
of the active phase.
Fig. 4. MPO on FeOx/SiO2 catalysts (BR data at 650 ◦C). Effect of the
preparation method on the relative activity (α) of the F[3700]S1-AP and
F[4300]S2-IW catalysts during t.o.s.
The catalytic pattern of the most active F[3700]S2-AP
and F[7300]S1-AP samples was also probed at a tenfold
lower contact time (τ, 3.3 × 10−4 s) to avoid kinetic limita-
tions imposed by high O2 conversion [2,19–21] and compare
their performance at conversion levels similar to those of
less active catalysts (Table 3). Under such conditions the
two catalysts feature similar Xh (4.6–4.8%) and SHCHO (54–
55%) values corresponding to STYHCHO values equal to
2800–2900 gkg−1
cat h−1 [9–12,46].
At the least the inﬂuence of the preparation method on
stability was evaluated by a comparison of the relative activ-
ity α (e.g., the ratio between activity at time t, Xh,t, and time
zero, Xh,0) of AP and IW catalysts during t.o.s. Depend-
ing on the preparation method, a different stability pattern is
recorded, as shown in Fig. 4, comparing representative data
for the F[3700]S1-AP and F[4300]S2-IW samples. That is,
while the latter catalyst keeps both activity and selectivity
substantially stable throughout the test, the former under-
goes a ca. 20% activity loss with a concomitant decrease in
SHCHO (from 36 to 30%) after 6 h of t.o.s. Notably, this re-
sulted a common pattern for all AP catalysts and IW samples
with Fe loading less than 0.4 wt%.

3.2.2. CF activity data
Integral activity data in the range of 400–750 ◦C (τ,
6.6 × 10−2 s) are compared in Table 4 in terms of tempera-
ture of 1% (T1%), 2% (T2%), and 5% (T5%) CH4 conversion,
HCHO selectivity (SHCHO), and apparent activation energy
values (Eapp, kJ/mol), calculated in the CH4 conversion
range of 1–10%.
The S2 carrier attains 1% CH4 conversion at 620 ◦C
with a SHCHO equal to 48%, prompting 2 and 5% conver-
sion levels at 650 ◦C (SHCHO, 43%) and 710 ◦C (SHCHO,
35%), respectively. These mirror an apparent activation en-
ergy value of 142 kJ/mol [2,20], resulting the highest in the
series (Table 4).
In agreement with BR data, the higher activity of AP
catalysts emerges from a shift of all of the conversion
levels to lower temperature (Table 3), consistently with a
decrease in the activation energy (Eapp, 83–101 kJ/mol).
The F[1000]S1-AP and F[1000]S2-IW samples feature a
similar catalytic pattern, denoted by the attainment of 1%
CH4 conversion (T1%) and an analogous SHCHO (25–27%)
at 500–520 ◦C. Mirroring a similar drop in the Eapp (82–
88 kJ/mol), both T2% and T5% are also shifted to lower
temperature by ca. 100 ◦C, and the SHCHO decreases to
20–22 and 18–20%, respectively. The addition of higher
Fe loadings (0.37–0.59 wt%) to F5 silica by AP, shifts
the conversion levels further to the same lower temperature
(450–460 ◦C), and, though the SHCHO decreases to 9–12%,
no changes in the Eapp (83–85 kJ/mol) are noticed. Mean-
while, CF data for the F[3700]S2-AP sample conﬁrm the
minor inﬂuence of the silica carrier on the MPO activity of
FeOx/SiO2 catalysts (Table 4). In contrast, the F[4300]S2-
IW sample displays the highest Tx% values, along with
the lowest SHCHO values in the series and, consequently,
the resulting Eapp (101 kJ/mol) is between the highest
(142 kJ/mol) and the lowest (82–88 kJ/mol) values found
for S2 and AP catalysts, respectively.
The performance of AP systems has been also probed un-
der oxygen-lean conditions with a feed of a 90% CH4/2.3%
O2/7.7% He reaction mixture and a constant contact time
(τ, 6.6 × 10−2 s). In spite of the high CH4/O2 ratio (≈40)
hindering the reaction kinetics [2,19–21], the F[1000]S1-
AP sample attains 1% (525 ◦C) and 2% (570 ◦C) conversion
levels at a temperature slightly higher than at standard con-
ditions (CH4/O2, 2), whereas a more than twofold rise
in SHCHO (54 and 49%) accounts for STYHCHO values of
360 and 650 gkg−1
cat h−1 at 525 and 570 ◦C, respectively.
A larger shift of both T1% and T2% to higher temperature
(Table 4) does not affect a similar increase in SHCHO on the
F[3700]S1-AP sample (Table 4).
3.3. Characterisation of the “treated” and “used”
catalysts
3.3.1. TPR of catalysts pretreated (650 ◦C) with CH4 and
CH4/O2 reaction mixture ﬂow
The TPR proﬁles of F[3700]S1-AP (A) and F[4300]S2-
IW (B) catalysts, pretreated for 5 min at 650 ◦C under
ﬂowing CH4 (top), are compared with the corresponding
proﬁles of the calcined samples (bottom) in Fig. 5A. Regard-
less of the preparation method and Fe loading, the treatment
of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts at 650 ◦C with methane causes a
marked decrease in the TPR signal in the T range of 350–
650 ◦C, evidently diagnostic of an extensive reduction of
Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ by the substrate. This reﬂects signiﬁcant
changes in the respective reduction proﬁle, no longer show-
ing the typical features of the calcined systems.
Furthermore, the reduction patterns of the “used”
F[3700]S1-AP and F[4300]S2-IW catalysts have been com-
pared with the relative spectra of “fresh” samples in Fig. 5B.
The TPR proﬁle of the “used” F[3700]S1-AP catalyst shows
marked changes in the reduction kinetics, evidently diagnos-
tic of a deep reconstructuring of the active phase, whereas
only a slight decrease in the rate of H2 consumption on
the rising side of the main TPR peak is noticed for the
F[4300]S2-IW system. As a consequence, the TPR spectra
for the “used” systems look similar to each other, repro-
ducing, in turn, almost unchanged the main features of the
“fresh” F[4300]S2-IW sample.

4. Discussion
4.1. Structure of low-loaded FeOx/SiO2 catalysts
Although a relatively poor concentration and reactivity
of the hydroxyl population in comparison with other ox-
ide supports (e.g., alumina, titania, zirconia, etc.), yet, at
a molecular scale the silica surface exhibits some chemi-
cal afﬁnity for supported metal atoms and/or ions [47,48],
along with some reactivity towards gas phases [2,3,13,49].
“Molecular” dispersion, then, entails a hard reducibility of
supported species, owing to the electron-withdrawal effect
exerted by the oxygen-bridged bonds, the extent of which
depends upon the structure of guest “hollow” sites of the sil-
ica surface [22,30,47,48,50,51]. On the basis of Mössbauer,
IR spectroscopy, and volumetric/gravimetric adsorptions,
then, Dumesic et al. argued that two states of Fe2+ exist
in a reduced 1 wt% Fe/SiO2 catalyst: Fe2+ strongly inter-
acting with the support and Fe2+ in small particles of iron
oxide [22]. They stressed that the former should be present
as thin “rafts” on the support, holding mostly Fe2+ in a low
coordination, whereas high-coordinated Fe2+ are present at
the surface of iron oxide particles [22]. A strong interac-
tion with silica hinders the reduction of both to the metallic
state [22], involving also Si4+/Fe3+ lattice substitution(s) in
tetrahedral sites of the magnetite structure [50].
In fact, the stabilisation of Fe2O3 particles, oxide nano-
clusters, isolated iron ions, and oxygen-bridged iron ions
does not depend upon the oxide support, being a function
of preparation method [22–28,30], loading [22–25,30,51],
and thermal treatments [22–30]. In this context, the chem-
istry of iron and oxide support in aqueous solution plays
an essential role. That is, avoiding an uncontrolled precip-
itation of the iron hydroxide (i.e., pKs Fe(OH)3 ∼
= 38 vs.
pKs Fe(OH)2 ∼
= 12) and exploiting the “selective” inter-
action of negatively charged silanolate groups with Fe2+
cations at pH > pHZPC, the AP route favours an effective
dispersion of Fe2+ ions all over the SiO2 surface [2,9–12]
according to the DR UV–Vis absorption pattern, monitoring
the prevailing contribution of “isolated” and “oligomeric”
FeIII–Ox species in the F[xxxx]S1-AP series (Fig. 1B). How-
ever, the shift of the absorption maximum, as the loading
increases, signals a growing degree of aggregation of the
surface FeOx species, forming 2-d patches over the silica
surface [22,27–29]. In contrast, despite a SSL comparable
with that of the F[5900]S1-AP sample (Table 1), an absorp-
tion fairly shifted to lower wavenumbers and the intense
absorption in the 20,000–10,000 cm−1 range (Fig. 1A, spec-
trum c) denote that Fe2O3 particles are largely present on the
F[4300]S2-IW system, as a consequence of the lack of any
effective interaction between silica and Fe3+ ions through-
out IW impregnation [8–12].
Thus, indicating a close relationship between dispersion
and redox properties of the active phase, the marked shift of
the main TPR maximum from 570–580 to ca. 400 ◦C, go-
ing from bare silica to F[4300]S2-IW, F[3700]S2-AP and
F[7300]S1-AP samples (Fig. 3), then monitors the reduc-
tion of Fe3+ ions belonging to various surface structures.
And so a systematic comparison of UV–vis and TPR features
indicates that the reduction of “isolated” Fe moieties, char-
acterised by the strongest interaction with the support, falls
in the temperature window of 550–750 ◦C, where the contri-
bution of several components is evident from TPR proﬁles
of silica carriers (Fig. 3, proﬁles a). Such species drive the
redox cycle with the substrate [2,8,12,16,19,20,36], being
then responsible for the effective catalytic pattern of “pre-
cipitated” silica [13,36,49]. At the opposite tendency, the
spectroscopic results for the F[4300]S2-IW sample signal an
almost quantitative contribution of hematite nanoparticles,
the reduction of which matches a symmetric peak centred at
ca. 400 ◦C (Fig. 3C, proﬁle b). Therefore, a weaker interac-
tion with the silica matrix of Fe3+ ions therein prompts an
easier reducibility with a rising degree of aggregation of the
active phase [6,7,9,11,22–28]. Mirroring a variable contri-
bution of various surface structures, then, the TPR proﬁles
of the FeOx/SiO2 system bear quantitative information on
the abundance of the various surface structures that is un-
available from spectroscopic measurements. For instance,
while the TPR pattern of the F[4300]S2-IW sample (Fig. 3C,
proﬁle b) matches satisfactorily with spectroscopic ﬁndings,
Mössbauer data for the F[7300]S1-AP sample indicate that
a signiﬁcant fraction (ca. 50%) of the active phase is in
the form of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, the presence of which is
barely visible, if at all, from the relative UV–vis absorp-
tion pattern (Fig. 1B, proﬁle d). Since deconvolution of TPR
spectra previously made it possible to highlight the structure
of supported V2O5 [35,36] and MoO3 [34,36] catalysts, an
analogous approach was adopted in the attempt to assess the
speciation of the active phase in the FeOx/SiO2 system.
4.2. Speciation and dispersion of the active phase
According to previous EPR [8] and FTIR data for ad-
sorbed NO [46,52], spectroscopic ﬁndings suggest that the
TPR pattern of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts monitors the cumula-
tive reduction of the following surface structures:
(i) “Isolated” FeIII ions located on different hollow sites of
the carrier, with a different degree of surface coordina-
tion [6–11,46,52];
(ii) 2-d aggregated FeIII species, forming thin “rafts/
patches” on the silica surface [22,46,52];
(iii) 3-d Fe2O3 particles, the reduction of which depends
mostly on crystal size [6–11,22,46,52].
Interaction strength, with matrix, spatial structure, and
coordination environment, controls the reducibility of FeIII
ions in the above surface species [11,46,51,52]. Then the
adopted modelling procedure implies that, at a given tem-
perature, the rate of catalyst reduction results from the
cumulative contribution of the various surface species, char-
acterised by a normal distribution of the activation energy

for reduction [34–36,52]. In fact, by a preliminary iterative
procedure it was found that all of the TPR proﬁles can be
described by a linear combination of ﬁve Gaussian peaks,
with the same centre position (M, ◦C) and full width at half-
maximum (fwhm, ◦C), and only a variable intensity (A, %)
[11,34–36,52]. Representative results for TPR spectra mod-
elling are shown in Fig. 6, displaying the deconvoluted TPR
spectra of differently loaded S1-supported AP systems (see
Fig. 3A). The parameters of the Gaussian components used
for the deconvolution of all TPR spectra are summarised
in Table 5. Although a scale factor of ca. 50 in the iron
concentration (Table 1), implying remarkable differences in
the sample loading (25–500 mg) throughout TPR measure-
ments, likely explains some variations in M (±20 ◦C) and
fwhm (±8 ◦C) values (Table 5), the fact that the same com-
ponent keeps an unchanged centre position and fwhm can
be taken as a reliable index of the same nature (and interac-
tion path) of the various Fe3+ species with silica regardless
of preparation route, Fe loading, and silica carrier [34–36].
Then the following attribution can be inferred.
The ﬁrst component (peak 1) centred at ca. 400 ◦C moni-
tors the reduction of 3-d “aggregates,” mostly in the form of
Fe2O3 nanoclusters.
The second component (peak 2), with the maximum at
ca. 500 ◦C, would be associated with the reduction of 2-d
(–Fe–O–Fe–)n patches (i.e., thin “rafts”) linked to the silica
surface by a network of “Fe–O–Si” bonds and, thus, result-
ing in less reducibility than that of oxide nanoclusters.
The third (peak 3) and fourth (peak 4) components, cen-
tred at ca. 600 and 700 ◦C, respectively, match with a poor
reducibility of isolated Fe3+ ions in a Td-like coordination
[6–9,11,46,51,52]. Their reducibility depends upon the num-
ber of “Fe–O–Si” linkages in the ﬁrst coordinative shell
and, thus, on location across different hollow sites of the
silica surface [47,48]. Indeed, previous FTIR data for ad-
sorbed NO indicated that only mono-nitrosyls form at an
Fe loading of ca. 1000 ppm (F[1000]S1-AP), whereas at
higher loadings (F[3700]S1-AP) both mono- and tri-nitrosyl
adducts form on FeII ions belonging to mono/oligomeric
moieties [46]. These results have been rationalised by con-
sidering that a number of structures exist on the surface of
the supports [47,48], depending on the location in “smaller”
or “large” (SiO2)n rings. The fewer oxygen atoms in the for-
mer, because of their propinquity, tend to strongly stabilise
“entrapped” Fe3+ ions. As a consequence, these structures
are the ﬁrst to “graft” incoming Fe ions at lower loading,
by ensuring a higher shielding. “Large” rings accommodate
transition-metal ions only at higher loading, implying an en-
hanced coordinative unsaturation. Thus isolated Fe3+ ions,
bearing multiple surface oxygen bridged bonds and located
in smaller hollow sites, are the most resistant to reduction
and can therefore be associated with the fourth component.
A higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of isolated FeIII
ions located in larger hollow sites implies an easier reducibil-
ity and can be then associated with the third component.
Perhaps, such an assignment explains the fact that Dume-
sic et al. could not detect isolated Fe2+ ions in a 1%
Fe/SiO2 catalyst reduced at 500 ◦C, but rather Fe2+ ions of
low coordination in some 2-d “thin rafts” along with high-
coordination Fe2+ ions of 3-d Fe2O3 clusters [22].

Fig. 6. Modelling of TPR spectra of F[xxxx]S1-AP catalysts (see Fig. 3A).
Concerning the zeroth component, its fate with load-
ing and preparation method makes the relative assignation
less straightforward, and hence requiring speciﬁc reason-
ing. That is, it is almost absent on systems with a very low
(⩽1000 ppm) Fe loading, where the presence of Fe2O3 ag-
gregates is also rather poor (Table 5). Its relative intensity
rises abruptly to ca. 22% of that of the Fe2O3 component,
remaining almost unchanged (≈25%) up to the F[7300]S1-
AP catalyst (Table 5). Moreover, at a comparable Fe loading,
the intensity ratio of the 0th and ﬁrst components on IW sys-
tems is quite lower than on counterpart AP systems, whereas
for the same preparation route, F5 supported systems feature
a higher value of this ratio (Table 5). Finally, the F[4300]S2-
IW features the lowest value (8%) of the above ratio. These
ﬁndings suggest that the 0th peak is somewhat related to the
dispersion of oxide aggregates, thus belonging to reduction
of Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide nanoparticles, though it
could also refer to some intermediate (e.g., Fe3O4) reduction
step.
By this account, the speciation of the active phase in both
F[xxxx]Sy-AP and F[xxxx]Sy-IW catalysts can be generally
related to the SSL, as shown in Fig. 7A, comparing the rela-
tive percentage of FeIII ions in the various surface structures.
As expected, the concentration of isolated moieties de-
creases monotonically with SSL, whereas that of 3-d oxide
particles rises much more steadily with an exponential-like
trend (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the featureless trend of
2-d patches matches is consistent with the fact that these are
“borderline” structures, easily evolving into 3-d oxide clus-
ters. However, the different trends of AP (solid lines) and IW
(dotted lines) systems indicate that, in addition to the SSL,
the preparation route is crucial for the stabilisation of the
various surface structures of the FeOx/SiO2 system. Indeed,
with respect to Mo [34,36] and V [35,36], FeIII ions feature
a much lower chemical afﬁnity for the silica surface, since
an amount of Fe2O3 clusters comparable to that found on
bare silicas (ca. 15%) was detected at much larger SSL on
MoO3/SiO2 [34,36] and V2O5/SiO2 [35,36] systems. Fur-
thermore, a ca. 80% concentration of oxide particles, like
that found on the F[4300]S2-IW sample (ca. 0.1 Feat nm−2),
occurs on a 7% MoO3/SiO2 bearing a 50-fold larger SSL
[34,36]. This different behaviour indicates that a weaker in-
teraction of FeIII ions with silonalol groups is the driving
force for the poor dispersion of the active phase in IW
systems, whereas, favouring a stronger metal-support inter-
action, the AP route hinders the mobility of Fe ions and
formation of 3-d oxide clusters also on the “highly loaded”
F[7300]S1-AP sample (SSL ≈0.14 Feat nm−2).
The assumptions of deconvolution analysis then make it
possible to deﬁne the dispersion, D, of the active phase as
the ratio between the concentration of “exposed” Fe atoms
in the various structures (i.e., A0 + A2 + A3 + A4) and the
total number of Fe atoms reduced up to 750 ◦C (i.e., A0 +
A1 + A2 + A3 + A4)
D = NFesurface
NFetotal
=
(A0 + A2 + A3 + A4)
(A0 + A1 + A2 + A3 + A4).
Dispersion of AP and IW catalysts as a function of the re-
spective SSL is shown in Fig. 7B. It is evident that whereas
the AP route ensures a rather good dispersion (0.85–0.55) of
the active phase, decreasing regularly with SSL to the value
of ca. 0.15 Feat nm−2, the IW implies an unpredictable ex-
tent of aggregation of the active phase, which is more evident
for SSL exceeding the value of 0.05 Feat nm−2 (Table 1)
[8–13]. The inﬂuence of the silica carrier is then mostly
linked to the speciﬁc surface area and relative SSL [34–36].
4.3. Surface structures and catalytic activity
The thermodynamic driving force for consecutive ox-
idation(s) of organic molecules into more stable carbon
oxide(s) entails the running of selective oxidations under a
kinetic regime. In terms of catalyst features, moreover, se-
lective oxidations demand oxide systems bearing speciﬁc
ensemble(s) of active sites with a strength of the metal–
oxygen bond timely tuned on the reactivity of the substrate
[2,6,7,16,53,54]. In particular, “isolated” Fe3+ ions sup-
ported on silica carriers join an enhanced functionality for

CH4 activation with a remarkable selectivity for oxygenated
products [6–12], resulting in a MPO performance superior
to that of any other system [6,12,13]. Ab initio quantum-
chemical calculations suggest that this outstanding catalytic
behaviour arises from an intrinsic efﬁciency of the FeO+
complex in activating the CH4 molecule, driving its pri-
mary oxy-functionalisation to CH3OH [17,18], whereas 3-d
Fe2O3 structures depress the catalytic functionality of the ti-
tle system because of a poor dispersion and the enhanced
reducibility of the surface Fe3+ centres [7–11,46,52]. On
the whole these ﬁndings match with the “site isolation” re-
quirement, well known in the ﬁeld of selective oxidation
reactions [1,12,16,53–56], postulating that a desired reaction
path proceeds over an ensemble of active sites containing
the minimum number of centres for substrate activation and
functionalisation [1,2,12,53–56], whereas a high availability
and mobility of nucleophylic lattice O= species, typical of
bulk oxide clusters [6,8,53,54], is detrimental for interme-
diate product lifetime. Although BR and CF catalytic data
(Tables 3 and 4) conﬁrm the superior functionality of AP
catalysts arising from a higher dispersion of the active phase
on silica carriers (Fig. 7B), previous kinetic-mechanistic
ﬁndings indicated a second-order dependence of CH4 ac-
tivation rate on the concentration of active sites [21]. The
plot of FeCH4 values vs. D of the various catalysts, shown
in Fig. 8, really provides a satisfactory experimental sup-
port for that theoretical relationship, conﬁrming the superior
dependence of substrate activation on site concentration
[2,16,19–21]. Moreover, the product selectivity is even more
sensitive to the degree of aggregation of the active phase,
since the different reducibilities of the various surface struc-
tures determine the type and concentration of oxygen species
(O2−, O22−, O−, etc.) featuring an electrophilic or nucle-
ophilic character and, then, a different reactivity towards
CH4 and/or intermediates (CH3OH/HCHO) [1,12,16,53,54].
Thus an easy reducibility would permit the prevailing for-
mation of O2−ions at the surface of oxide nanoparticles,
prompting the conversion of HCHO into COx by a nucle-
ophilic attack on the C atom, whereas the poor electron
availability of dispersed species leads mostly to the for-
mation of electrophilic oxygen species that are more active
towards the unpolarised C–H bond of the methane molecule.
This indicates that an effective MPO functionality is enabled
by dispersion values higher than 0.5 (Fig. 8).
Deeper insight into the reactivity of various surface
species can be achieved from TPR data for CH4-pretreated
catalysts (Fig. 5A). Notably, despite the relevant changes
with respect to those of the calcined systems, these reduc-
tion patterns result still from the linear combination of the
(same) ﬁve Gaussian components used for the deconvolution
of the TPR spectra of the “fresh” systems (Fig. 6), according
to the ﬁtting parameter values listed in Table 5. The relative
intensities of the various components in “fresh” and “CH4-
pretreated” systems, shown in Fig. 9A, points to a marked
decrease in the peak 1 and, to a lower extent, in peaks 2
and 3, previously assigned to the reduction of “3-d Fe2O3
clusters” (peak 1), “2-d FeOx polymeric patches” (peak 2),
and “low-coordination isolated” species (peak 3), respec-
tively. Despite the considerable (>70%) reduction of 3-d
Fe2O3 species, the decrease in the component (peak 0) rel-
ative to Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide particles is less
pronounced (20–40%), whereas the intensity of the peak 4
related to the reduction of “strongly-interacting” isolated
species is almost unchanged. A marked decrease in the peak
area relative to oxide clusters (peak 1) and, to a lesser ex-
tent, in 2-d FeOx patches (peak 2) and low-coordinated

version (FeCH4) and HCHO formation (FeHCHO) and oxide dispersion (D),

Fe3+ ions (peak 3) is diagnostic of an increasing strength
of the “Fe–O” bond, rendering oxygen atoms kinetically
less available for methane (over)oxidation. The lowest re-
ducibility of high-coordinated Fe3+ ions (peak 4) hinders
any interaction with the substrate at 650 ◦C. Therefore, tak-
ing into account that the reactivity towards CH4 parallels
the reducibility of the various surface structures, a decrease
of the 0th component comparable to or even stronger than
that of oxide particles (peak 1) should be expected. A plau-
sible explanation for the slight changes in the intensity of
this component (Fig. 9A) lies in a high diffusion rate of O2−
ions across the lattice of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, stabilising
mostly Fe3+ ions at the surface. This, in addition to account-
ing for the low activity and selectivity of poorly dispersed
systems (Tables 2 and 3), also explains the “oxygen-release”
phenomenon observed on FeOx/SiO2 catalysts characterised
by high concentrations of 3-d oxide species during RTOC
measurements [8,10]. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that
2-d FeOx patches, featuring an intermediate strength of the
oxygen bond and a limited availability of oxygen ions, en-
sure the best MPO activity–selectivity pattern. In fact, the
slight shift of 1 and 2% conversion levels recorded on the
F[1000]S1-AP sample under oxygen-lean conditions (Ta-
ble 4) signals an easier occurrence of the redox reaction
cycle on such a system featuring a catalytic pattern dom-
inated by 2-d FeOx patches. The variable extent of the
energetic barrier further supports this evidence, as Eapp is
the highest (142 kJ/mol) on the silica, which contains only
200 ppm Fe, mostly as isolated ions, and the lowest (80–
85 kJ/mol) on the AP FeOx/SiO2 catalysts, which feature
a catalytic pattern dominated by higher concentrations of
2-d FeOx patches. The higher degree of nuclearity of such
species, likely enabling a more effective transfer of elec-

trons and reaction intermediates, could explain the decrease
in the energetic barrier with respect to bare silica. In con-
trast, and inconsistent with the overwhelming concentration
of easily reducible oxide (nano)particles, the intermediate
Eapp value (101 kJ/mol) of the F[4300]S2-IW sample likely
stems from the intrinsic difﬁculty generating electrophilic
oxygen species from easily reducible Fe2O3 aggregates (re-
quired by CH4 activation [12,16,53,54]), owing to a high
electron availability in the crystal lattice [6–12]. The fact that
in the pretreated sample the relative concentration of oxi-
dised Fe3+ ions at the surface of oxide species is much larger
than in the bulk strengthens the above hypothesis. Therefore,
such ﬁndings prove that different electronic features of the
Fe–O bond parallel the structure of the various surface FeOx
species, prompting, as a consequence, different oxygen ac-
tivation paths according to the scheme drawn in Fig. 10.
Deconvolution analysis of TPR spectra for the “used” cata-
lysts (Fig. 5B) indicates that the changes in the TPR pattern
of the “used” F[3700]S1-AP sample stem mostly from the
quantitative transformation of 2-d FeOx patches (peak 2)
and, to a small extent, of isolated moieties (peaks 3 and 4)
into 3-d Fe2O3 clusters (peak 1), as shown in Fig. 9B. On the
other hand, the changes in the structure of the F[4300]S2-IW
sample, which is characterised by an overwhelming concen-
tration (>85%) of aggregated 3-d oxide particles, appear
to be negligible. This result is a direct consequence of the
surface-assisted redox reaction cycle, involving a cyclic se-
quence of rupture and formation of metal–oxygen bonds
as a result of the alternate activation of substrate and oxy-

gen, respectively [2–6,12,16–21,53,54]. As for the rupture
of Fe–O–Si(Fe) bridged bonds, the redox cycle prompts the
“mobility” of Fe3+ ions and the consequent sintering, which
affects the stability of AP systems (Fig. 4) in a way analo-
gous to the effect on the stability of well-dispersed Fe-ZSM5
systems in the SCR of NOx, causing the “extraction” of Fe3+
ions from the zeolite framework [25,57].
5. Conclusions
The adsorption/precipitation method is much more effec-
tive than incipient wetness in promoting the dispersion of
iron across silica carriers.
The speciation of the active phase determines the reduc-
tion pattern of the FeOx/SiO2 system.
“Isolated species,” 2-d (FeOx)n patches and 3-d Fe2O3
clusters, coexist on the surface of silica carriers and FeOx/
SiO2 catalysts; their relative abundance depends on the
preparation method and surface loading.
The adsorption/precipitation method strongly enhances
the MPO performance of FeOx/SiO2 catalysts by improving
the dispersion of the active phase.
The redox reaction cycle yields sintering phenomena
of the active phase, causing a progressive deactivation of
FeOx/SiO2 catalysts.
