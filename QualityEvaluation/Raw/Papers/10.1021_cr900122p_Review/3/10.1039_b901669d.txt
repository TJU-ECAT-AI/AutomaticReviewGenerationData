Grafting of Os bisalkylidene complexes, [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated
at 700 ◦C selectively yields an alkylidyne complex [(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] according to mass
balance analysis, IR and solid state NMR spectroscopies, but 70% of the silanols remains unreacted.
Grafting corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand and induces the isomerisation of
the metal fragment from a bis-alkylidene to an alkyl alkylidyne. Molecular (B3PW91) and periodic
DFT-calculations show that the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the
perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more stable when one of the alkyl ligands
is replaced by a siloxy ligand. The change of the nature of the ligand is accompanied with a change of
geometry: from a distorted tetrahedral structure for [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] to a butterﬂy-geometry
with apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands for [(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]. Finally, DFT calculations
show that grafting occurs via a s-bond metathesis between the silanol and a metal–alkyl bond and not
through the typical addition of the silanol onto the alkylidene ligand.

Introduction
Grafting well-deﬁned metal complexes on oxides and partic-
ularly silica has allowed the preparation of numerous well-
deﬁned surface complexes.1 This approach has been used to
develop “single-site” heterogeneous catalysts for a wide range
of applications (alkene hydrogenation, alkene polymerization and
metathesis, alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis…), which can
be understood at a molecular level and thereby tuned through
structure–reactivity relationship.1–5 In the particular case of silica,
it was noted very early that the silanols of silica surfaces can
be advantageously used as efﬁcient “solid” ligands to activate
a metal center.6 Over the years, it has been shown that highly
dehydroxylated silica, such as those obtained upon treatment
under vacuum at 700 ◦C (SiO2-(700)), contain mainly isolated silanols
and can therefore be viewed as a large h1-siloxy ligand. Thus
grafting metal complexes XMLn on SiO2-(700) can be used to quan-
titatively generate the corresponding SiOMLn surface complexes
along with one molecule of XH. Additionally, during this grafting
step, no structural change is usually observed for the remaining
spectator ligands.1 Here we show, through a combined use of ex-
periment and theory, that grafting the perhydrocarbyl complex 1,
[Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2], a d2 ML4 bis-alkylidene complex, is
not quantitative (presence of residual surface silanols) and yields

a monosiloxy surface species 2 as a single alkyl alkylidyne isomer
[(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]. DFT calculations were carried
out to understand the observed metal fragment isomerisation of
these d2 ML4 complexes upon grafting (bis-alkylidene →alkyl
alkylidyne), a process never observed for the corresponding d0 ML4
homologues.7–13 We describe the origin of the relative stabilities,
determine grafting reaction pathways and discuss consequences.

Experimental
All experiments were carried out by using standard air free
methodology in a glove box under Ar, on a Schlenk line, or
in Schlenk-type apparatus interfaced to a high vacuum line
(10-5 Torr). The complex [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1) was pre-
pared according to the literature procedure.14 CH2Cl2 was distilled
over P2O5 and stored over 3 A
˚ molecular sieves. Pentane was
distilled from NaK under N2. Propene and ethylene (U, Air
liquide) were puriﬁed over R3–11 BASF catalyst/MS 4 A
˚ prior
to use. Cis-2-pentene was degassed, distilled over Na and stored
under 3 A
˚ molecular sieves. Silica (Aerosil Degussa, 200 m2g-1)
was compacted with distilled water, calcined under air at 500 ◦C
for 2 h and treated under vacuum (500 ◦C, 12 h and 700 ◦C,
4 h) (support referred to as SiO2-(700)). Gas-phase analysis was
performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph
equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector and a KCl/Al2O3 on
a fused silica column (50 m ¥ 0.32 mm). Elemental analysis
was performed at the Mikroanalytisches Labor PASCHER in
Germany. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 550-FT
by using an infrared cell equipped with CaF2 windows, allowing in
situ studies. Typically 16 scans were accumulated for each spectrum
(resolution, 4 cm-1). Liquid state NMR spectra were recorded
in C6D6 using a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer and solid state
NMR spectra were recorded under MAS on a Bruker Avance

500 spectrometer with a conventional double resonance 4 mm
CP-MAS probe. The MAS frequency was set to 10 kHz. The
samples were introduced in a 4 mm zirconia rotor in the glove box
and tightly closed. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm downﬁeld
from SiMe4 (± 0.1 and 1 ppm for
1H and
13C NMR spectra,
respectively).
Grafting of 1 on SiO2-(700) monitored by infrared spectroscopy
Silica (26–50 mg) was pressed into a 18 mm self-supporting disk
and put into a sealed glass high-vacuum reactor equipped with
CaF2 windows. After calcination at 500 ◦C for 2 h, the silica
disk was partially dehydroxylated under vacuum (500 ◦C, 14 h
and 700 ◦C, 4 h). The disk was then immersed in a mixture of 1
(3 equiv./SiOH) in pentane (10 mL) at 25 ◦C for 3.5 h followed by
two pentane washings and a drying step under vacuum (10-5 Torr)
at room temperature. An IR spectrum was recorded before and
after impregnation.
Preparation of [1/SiO2-(700)] by impregnation
A mixture of 1 (1 equiv. per SiOH) and SiO2-(700) (200 mg, 0.06 mmol
OH) in pentane (5 mL) was stirred at 25 ◦C for 3.5 h. After
ﬁltration, the solid was washed 4 times with pentane. The resulting
colored powder was dried under vacuum (10-5 Torr, 30 min) to
yield 197 mg of [1/SiO2-(700)]. Elemental analysis of [1/SiO2-(700)]:
Os: 1.42%wt, C: 1.23%wt. 1H MAS NMR: 0.94 (CH2tBu), 1.18

Preparation of [1*/SiO2-(700)]
This compound was prepared as the unlabelled compound
starting with 5%
13C labeled [Os(=C*HtBu)2(C*H2tBu)2] pre-
pared from 10%
13C labeled [Ta(=C*HtBu)(C*H2tBu)3]15 and
[Os(O)2(CH2tBu)2].14
Reaction of propene with [1/SiO2-(700)]
The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol Os) was loaded in a 38 mL reactor
ﬂask and propene (525 Torr, 1.0 mmol, 184 equiv.) was added. The
reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by
GC over time.
Reaction of ethene with [1/SiO2-(700)]
The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol Os) was loaded in a 32 mL reactor
ﬂask and ethene (670 Torr, 1.1 mmol, 320 equiv.) was added. The
reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by
GC over time.
Reaction of cis-2-pentene with [1/SiO2-(700)]
The solid [1/SiO2-(700)] (4 mmol) was loaded in a 38 mL reactor ﬂask
and cis-2-pentene (345 Torr, 0.8 mmol, 143 equiv.) was added. The
reaction mixture was stirred and small aliquots were analysed by
GC over time.

Computational details
The Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)(X) and Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2(X)
(X = CH2tBu or the siloxy group of amorphous silica surface)
complexes have been modeled using two sets of molecular
calculations: (1) a small DFT model where the tBu groups have
been substituted by methyl groups and the surface is represented by
OSiH3 (XQ) and (2) a large model computed using the ONIOM16
approach (XL) where all tBu groups have been included and the
surface is represented by [OSi(OSiH3)3]. A fully DFT periodic
model has also been used for the grafted complex (2) only (2S).
The reaction mechanisms have been explored only with the smaller
(XQ) model.
Molecular DFT calculations have been performed with the
hybrid B3PW91 density functional,17,18 as implemented in the
Gaussian03 package.19 The Os and Si atoms have been represented
with the quasi relativistic effective core pseudo-potentials (RECP)
of the Stuttgart group and the associated basis sets augmented
with a polarization function.20–23 The C, H, N and O atoms have
been represented with 6-31G(d,p) basis sets.24 For the ONIOM
calculations, the calculations were conducted in two steps. The
geometry optimization was carried out using a DFT/DFT’
approach. The inner layer is deﬁned by the atoms present in
the small model and the level of calculations is that used for the
small model. The outer layer is calculated also at the DFT level
but with a basis set with no polarization function on Os and Si
and a 3-21G basis set for C, O and H. In a second step, single-
point calculations with the basis set used for the inner layer were
carried out. The geometry optimizations were performed without
any symmetry constraint, and the nature of the extrema (local
minima or transition states) was checked by analytical frequency
calculations. The discussion of the results is based on the electronic
energies E without any ZPE corrections because inclusion of the
ZPE corrections does not signiﬁcantly modify the results. The free
energy values G have been computed with Gaussian03 at 298.15 K
and P = 1 atm.
DFT periodic calculations, carried out with VASP,25,26 have been
performed using a dehydroxylated (110) cristobalite model for sil-
ica and a methodology described previously.27–29 The calculations
were carried out with the PBEPBE density functional30 and the
projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism.31,32 As calibrated in
earlier works,27 the plane-wave energy cut-off has been ﬁxed to
400 eV and the Brillouin zone has been represented by a (2,2,1)
mesh.

Grafting of 1 on silica [1/SiO2].
After immersing a silica
disk partially dehydroxylated at 700 ◦C (SiO2-(700), 0.26 mmol
accessible OH/g of silica) for 3.5 h in a pale orange solution
containing an excess of [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1) in pentane
at 25 ◦C, the disk was slightly coloured. After washing twice
with pentane to remove the excess of complex and then drying
under vacuum (10-5 Torr), recording an IR spectrum (Fig. S1†)
showed that the band attributed to isolated silanol groups at
3747 cm-1 decreased (35% free OH consumed), and a broad band
appeared in agreement with the presence of the silanols interacting

with organometallic moieties (3735–3400 cm-1).28 Moreover, two
groups of bands appeared in the 3000–2850 cm-1 and 1480–
1350 cm-1 regions. These bands are assigned to n(CH) and d(CH)
vibrations of the alkyl ligands respectively. When grafting of 1
(1 equiv./OH) was carried out on larger quantities of a silica
partially dehydroxylated at 700 ◦C (SiO2-(700), 0.2 g, 0.052 mmol
SiOH) by impregnation in pentane at 25 ◦C over 3.5 h, silica
homogeneously changed color and the solution was partially
discolored. Osmium elemental analysis on the resulting solid was
1.41%wt. This loading corresponded to 0.074 mmol Os/g and
to the consumption of only ca. 30% of the available surface
silanols (0.26 mmol OH/g for SiO2-(700)), which is consistent with
IR data (vide supra). Note that a longer reaction time did not
increase Os loading. Moreover, carbon elemental analysis is 1.23 ±
0.1%wt, which corresponds to 14 ± 1 C/Os and thereby shows
the presence of three remaining C5 ligands per Os. Moreover,
this system was characterized by solid state NMR. First, the 1H
MAS NMR spectrum of [1/SiO2] displays signals at 0.95, 1.2,
1.8, 3.3 and 4.9 ppm (Fig. S2a†), clearly showing the absence of
alkylidene protons, expected at a much lower ﬁeld (between 6–
20 ppm). The two intense peaks at 0.95 and 1.2 ppm in a 2:1
relative intensity, are consistent with the presence of two types
of tBu-containing ligands present in a 2-to-1 ratio. The peak
at 1.8 ppm is typical of residual silanols, which is consistent
with the low Os loadings and the IR data. Finally, the two
peaks at 3.30 and 4.94 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio, were tentatively
attributed to two diastereotopic protons of a neopentyl ligand
by comparison with known molecular complexes.14 These data
suggest the formation of [(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (2-yne) in
place of [(≡SiO)Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)] (2-bis-ene) (Scheme 1).
Scheme 1
Grafting of the bis-alkylidene complex 1 on SiO2-(700) and
resulting surface complexes 2.
This attribution was further conﬁrmed by
1H DQ NMR
(Fig. S3†),33 by the presence of two off-diagonal correlations at the
sum of the chemical shifts of these two protons, which shows that
they are spatially close. This assignment is further corroborated
by direct detection and CP-MAS 13C NMR of [1/SiO2] (Fig. S4†):
the two peaks in a 1:2 ratio at 22 and 29 ppm can be attributed
to the methyl groups of the neopentylidyne and the neopentyl
ligands, respectively; the corresponding quaternary carbons being
also observed in a 1:2 ratio at 54 (≡CCMe3) and 35 (CH2CMe3)
ppm. However, no peak associated with the carbons directly bound
to Os can be detected. Note that this surface complex like 1 is
not very stable (it fully decomposes at room temperature within
24h), which prevents the use of a long accumulation time. Using
the corresponding 13C labelled compound [1*/SiO2] (5%), it was
possible to detect, albeit with a poor signal to noise ratio, the
alkylidyne and the methylene carbons of the neopentyl ligands
at 263 ppm and 22 ppm, respectively (See Fig. S4b–c†). Note,
however, that good quality spectra were difﬁcult to obtain because
of the low concentration of these species (partial grafting) and the
thermal instability of these systems (4–8 h stability window at
room temperature). Nonetheless, combining all the available data
clearly shows that the reaction of [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2] (1-bis-
ene), a mixture of anti,anti- and anti,syn-bis-alkylidene complexes,
with a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 ◦C gives 2-yne, a well-
deﬁned alkylidyne Os. This is noteworthy, because, in contrast
to d0 ML4 complexes, for which no structural change has been
observed, the metal fragment of this d2 ML4 Os complex changed
from bis-alkylidene to alkyl alkylidyne upon grafting.11–13
In terms of reactivity, [1/SiO2-(700)] reacts with propene (270–
1600 equiv/Os) to give ethene (5.7 equiv), butenes (6.9 equiv),
2,2-dimethylpropane (0.6 equiv), higher alkene homologues:
pentenes (1.2 equiv), hexenes (4.1 equiv) and 3,3-dimethylbutene
(1.7 ;equiv). The nature of the products clearly shows that
several reactions concomitantly take place: alkene metathesis,
dimerization (oxidative coupling) and isomerisation, albeit with
a fast deactivation. Additionally, the reaction of [1/SiO2-(700)] with
ethene (320 equiv) yields propene (0.5 equiv), 1-butene (0.3 equiv),
cis- (0.2 equiv) and trans 2-butene (0.6 equiv). Finally, this reaction
of [1/SiO2-(700)] with cis 2-pentene (210 equiv) yields mainly to
the isomerisation of this substrate into a thermodynamic mixture
of pentene isomers (18.8, 78.8 and 2.4% of cis 2-pentene, trans
2-pentene and 1-pentene) along with trace amounts of 3-hexenes
(0.2 equiv), probably formed via metathesis. The overall reactivity
of [1/SiO2-(700)] with alkenes shows that hydrides are probably
generated in the presence of alkenes and catalyse isomerisation.
However, the high unstability of this system makes it an unsuitable
catalyst precursor, in contrast to the equivalent d0 Systems
[(≡SiO)M(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (M = Mo11 and W12,13,34,35), which
are highly efﬁcient alkene metathesis catalysts.

4.2.1.
Relative stability of bis-alkylidene vs. alkyl alkylidyne
complexes.
The relative stability of bis-alkylidene and alkyl
alkylidyne isomeric complexes depends on the identity of the
spectator ligands.8,9 The bis-alkylidene [Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)2]
(1-bis-ene) is observed in the case of perhydrocarbyl complexes
(and not the alkyl alkylidyne isomer [Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)3],
1-yne), while the contrary is found for the silica supported system,
i.e. observation of [(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (2-yne) rather
than [(≡SiO)Os(=CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)] (2-bis-ene). These structural
preferences have been investigated by DFT calculations using the
three types of models described in the computational details: (1)
small molecular models calculated at the full DFT level (XQ), (2)
large molecular models calculated with the ONIOM approach
(XL), (3) periodic surface models (XS).
Perhydrocarbyl complexes 1.
The bis-alkylidene complex
[Os=CHR)2(CH2R)2] exists as three isomers differing by the
position of the R group of the alkylidene ligands, anti (a) or syn
(s). With the small molecular models (R = Me), the energies of the
three bis-alkylidene isomers span only a 1.5 kcal mol-1 range with
the following order of decreasing stability: (a,a)-, (s,a)-, and (s,s)-
1Q-bis-ene (Fig. 1). In contrast, the alkyl alkylidyne isomer 1Q-yne,
[Os(≡CMe)(CH2Me)3], lies 14.7 kcal mol-1 above the most stable
bis-alkylidene complex, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. With the large molecular
models, the (s,a)-1L-bis-ene is marginally more stable than the
(a,a)-isomer (-1.5 kcal mol-1), but the (s,s)-isomer has not been

located as a minimum on the potential energy surface, probably
because of steric crowding associated with the two tBu groups
of the alkylidene ligands pointing towards each other. The alkyl
alkylidyne complex 1L-yne remains signiﬁcantly higher in energy,
i.e. 16.2 kcal mol-1 above the most stable (s,a)-1L-bis-ene isomer.
In terms of the structure, the bis-alkylidene complexes 1Q-bis-
ene have distorted tetrahedral geometries with an angle of ca.
124◦between the two alkyl groups and a smaller one between
the two coplanar alkylidene ligands, which is 99◦, 107◦to 115◦
for (a,a)-, (s,a)- and (s,s)-1Q-bis-ene, respectively. For 1L-bis-
ene, the steric bulk of the tBu group marginally modiﬁes the
geometries: the angles between the two neopentyl ligands and the
two neopentylidene ligands in the (s,a)-isomer are 122◦and 111◦,
respectively, and they are 126◦and 94◦in the (a,a)-isomer. The
alkyl alkylidyne complexes, 1Q-yne and 1L-yne, adopt a trigonal
pyramidal structure with one alkyl ligand at the apical position;
the alkylidyne being one of the three basal ligands. Overall, the cal-
culated relative energies are in good agreement with experimental
observations, i.e. the (s,a)- and (a,a)-1-bis-ene are the only observed
complexes with the former being slightly more abundant.14
Siloxy complexes 2.
Replacing one alkyl by a siloxy ligand
greatly changes the relative stabilities of bis-alkylidene and alkyl
alkylidyne complexes (Fig. 2). With the small molecular models,
the alkyl alkylidyne complex, 2Q-yne, lies only 0.7 kcal mol-1 above
(a,a)-2Q-bis-ene, the most stable bis-alkylidene isomer. The three
bis-alkylidene isomers are in decreasing order of stability: (a,a)-,
(s,a)-, (s,s)-2Q-bis-ene, as already found for 1Q-bis-ene, but with
a larger energy span of 4.8 kcal mol-1. With the large molecular
models, the alkyl alkylidyne complex 2L-yne is the most stable
isomer, the (a,a)- and (s,a)-2L-bis-ene being 4.9 and 5.4 kcal mol-1

above 2L-yne, respectively. The (s,s)-isomer has not been located
as for the perhydrocarbyl case (1L-bis-ene). Using the cristobalite
surface models, the alkyl alkylidyne complex 2S-yne is also more
stable than the bis-alkylidene complexes by 0.4 and 3.6 kcal mol-1
for (a,a)- and (s,a)-2S-bis-ene, respectively.
In terms of structure, the bis-alkylidene siloxy complexes 2-bis-
ene resemble the bis-alkylidene perhydrocarbyl complexes 1-bis-
ene. In contrast, the alkyl alkylidyne siloxy complexes 2-yne have
a butterﬂy structure with a large angle between the alkylidyne and
the siloxy ligands (153◦for 2Q-yne, 145◦for 2L-yne and 154◦for
2S-yne) and a small one between the two alkyl ligands (101◦for
2Q-yne, 87◦for 2L-yne and 93◦for 2S-yne).
On the origin of structural preferences.
The geometry of these
tetra-coordinated d2 ML4 complexes signiﬁcantly varies with the
identity of the spectator ligand. The perhydrocarbyl and the
siloxy bis-alkylidene complexes have both a pseudo-tetrahedral
structure. In contrast, the corresponding alkylidyne isomers adopt

apical alkyl group for the perhydrocarbyl complex vs. a butterﬂy
structure with a siloxy ligand nearly trans to the alkylidyne for
the siloxy complex. The unique tetrahedral geometry for the bis-
alkylidene and the two geometries for the alkylidyne complexes
can be rationalized by a qualitative energy diagram (Scheme 2).
As already described for d0 ML4 group 6 and Re complexes,
the degeneracy within the e and t2 orbital sets is lifted by the
presence of the p-bonds.36 Therefore, for the three coordination
geometries, the diagrams show the presence of a non-degenerated
non-bonding d orbital able to accommodate the 2 electrons of
OsVI and another two d-orbitals spatially orientated to establish
the Os–C p-bonds associated with the two alkylidene or the
alkylidyne ligands. For the butterﬂy structure, the p-bonds are
formed with two non-bonding metal d orbitals, while in the case
of the tetrahedron one of the p-bonds uses a metal d orbital with
some s-bond antibonding character. What distinguishes these
three isomers is the trans effect associated with the s-bonded Os-
ligands. In a tetrahedron, there is no mutually trans ligand thus
allowingtheaccommodationofligandswithalargetranseffectlike
perhydrocarbyls. In the case of a butterﬂy structure, the two apical
ligands are mutually trans, and it is preferable that one of them
has a weak trans effect (i.e. siloxy ligand). Since the alkylidyne
occupies the other apical site due to the dp–pp interactions, the
preferred structure has apical alkylidyne and siloxy ligands. This
leaves a lone pair on the metal pointing away from two basal
ligands. In contrast to the butterﬂy structure, the trigonal pyramid
has no ligand trans to each other, but three coplanar basal ligands,
which exert a moderate mutual trans effect. As a consequence,
the trigonal pyramid can be a high lying minimum, above the
preferred tetrahedral structure when all basal ligands have strong
trans effect such as for the perhydrocarbyl complex.
Scheme 2
Qualitative molecular orbital diagrams for d2 ML4 complexes:
(a) a tetrahedral bisalkylidene, (b) a butterﬂy alkylidyne and (c) a trigonal
pyramid alkylidyne complexes. The p label indicates the orbitals that have
the proper symmetry to enter dp/pp interactions. The two electrons on
Os have been localized in the orbital that is occupied according to the
calculations.
The d0 ML4 group 6 complexes and presently studied d2 ML4
Os complexes have different structural preferences. The alkyl
alkylidyne d0 ML4 complexes are more stable than the bis-
alkylidene isomers and adopt a pseudo-tetrahedral geometry, e.g.
[M(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] and [(SiO)M(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] (Mo11
and W12,13). Computational studies have shown that this preference
is in fact general.7–10 In contrast, the structural preference is ligand
dependant for d2 complexes. One clear difference between the
d0 and d2 species is that alkyl-alkylidyne d2 complexes adopt a
butterﬂy structure. Because of the large angle between two ligands
in a butterﬂy structure, trans effects are important and lead in
turn to a noticeable inﬂuence of the type of ligands (strong vs.
weak s-donor ligands) on the relative energy of bis-alkylidene vs.
alkyl-alkylidyne isomers. In the case of perhydrocarbyl ligands,
no alkyl-alkylidyne d2 OsL4 complex has been characterized;
however such a species was proposed as an intermediate to
account for H/D-isotope exchanges in bis-alkylidene complexes.
Such an intermediate could be trapped as a bis-pyridine adduct
[(TfO)Os(≡CtBu)(CH2tBu)3(Py)2].14 Noteworthy coordination of
additional ligands on ML4 d0 complexes induces the reverse effect
and stabilizes the bis-alkylidene isomers.9,10
Overall, the calculated relative stabilities obtained with the three
models are consistent with experiment: the observed structure of
the silica supported system corresponds to an alkyl alkylidyne
surface complex 2-yne, while it is the bis-alkylidene (1-bis-ene) for
the perhydrocarbyl complex. Additionally, calculations show that
2-yne probably adopts a butterﬂy structure and that the geometry
at the metal center changes upon grafting in the case of a d2 ML4
system. This is in sharp contrast with what has been observed
for d0 alkylidene28,37–40 or alkylidyne11–13,37 ML4 systems since they
keep their tetrahedral geometry upon grafting. Noteworthy the
butterﬂy structure bonded to the surface via one of the apical sites
has a lone pair on the metal pointing away from the two basal
alkyl ligands and thus taking the place of a ﬁfth coordination site.
4.2.2.
Grafting reaction pathways.
To further understand
the formation of 2-yne from 1-bis-ene, the reaction pathways
describing the grafting on silica have been investigated by DFT
calculations within the molecular approach using the small models
(XQ) and the most stable (a,a)-isomer of the bis-alkylidene
complex, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene.
Four pathways differing by their ﬁrst step have been found:
(1) Reaction of the silanol with one metal–ligand s-bond of
(a,a)-1-bis-ene yielding (a,a)-2-bis-ene and an alkane (Pathway 1,
s-bond metathesis, Scheme 3),
(2) Addition of the silanol to the metal–ligand p-bond of (a,a)-
1-bis-ene yielding a pentacoordinated trisalkylalkylidene complex
(Pathway 2: [1,2]-addition, Scheme 3),
(3) Isomerisation of (a,a)-1-bis-ene into 1-yne before grafting
(Pathway 3, Scheme 4),
(4) Isomerisation of (a,a)-1-bis-ene into 1-yne upon grafting
(Pathway 4, Scheme 4).
We describe the results of the calculations using the electronic
energies E and then the free energies G (values in parentheses in
Schemes 3 and 4).
Note ﬁrst that the reaction energies of 1Q-bis-ene plus silanol
giving either 2Q-bis-ene or 2Q-yne plus an alkane are -23.2 and
-22.5 kcal mol-1, respectively; showing that the anchoring process
of this Os complex on silica is highly exothermic.
Pathway 1.
Reaction of the silanol with one metal–ligand
s-bond of (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene occurs via a ﬁve coordinated TBP
transition state with the apical siloxy group being trans to either
an alkyl or an alkylidene ligand with associated energy barriers
of 30.1 and 22.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. This yields RCH3 and

Scheme 3
Grafting Pathways 1 (direct s-bond metathesis) and 2 ([1,2]-ad-
dition). Energies of reaction intermediates (E) are given with respect to
separated reactant (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene and silanol (H3SiOH). Energy barriers
are given above or below reaction arrows with respect to the starting point
of the elementary step. All energy values are given in kcal mol-1 and those
in parentheses correspond to free energies (G).
Scheme 4
Grafting Pathways via isomerisation of 1Q-yne before (Path-
way 3) and upon grafting (Pathway 4). Energies of reaction intermediates
(E) are given with respect to separated reactant (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene and silanol
(H3SiOH). Energy barriers are given above reaction arrows with respect
to the starting point of the elementary step. All energy values are given in
kcal mol-1 and those in parentheses correspond to free energies.
(a,a)-2Q-bis-ene with a favourable energy of reaction of -23.2 kcal
mol-1. The most favourable transition state has one alkylidene
trans to the siloxy group since this orientation favours the
distortion of the initial tetrahedron, which has no vacant site.
Conversion of (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene into 2Q-yne is almost athermic, but
it requires another high energy step to form the OsVIII hydrido
intermediate 3Q which lies 23.1 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene.
Pathway 2.
[1,2]-Addition of the O–H bond to one of the
metal–ligand p-bonds of (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene occurs via ﬁve coordi-
nated TBP transition states with the apical siloxy group being trans
to either an alkyl or an alkylidene ligand with energy barriers of
38.4 and 29.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. These two transition states
lead to two pentacoordinated trisalkylalkylidenesiloxy complexes
with either an alkyl (4aQ) or an alkylidene (4bQ) trans to the siloxy
ligand with a slightly favourable energy of reaction of -0.4 and
-5.5 kcal mol-1, respectively. Like in the ﬁrst step of Pathway 1, the
approach of the siloxy group trans to the alkylidene is much more
favoured, but [1,2]-addition is strongly disfavoured compared to
s-bond metathesis (Pathway 1). These intermediates 4Q can evolve
via a-H abstraction into 2Q-yne and RCH3 directly with an energy
barrier of 22.3 kcal mol-1. Alternatively, this can take place in
three steps via formation of (a,a)-2Q-bis-ene, but it involves much
higher transition states (ca. 40 kcal mol-1 above the most stable
intermediate 4bQ).
Pathway 3.
First, (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene undergoes isomerisation
into 1Q-yne in a two-step process starting with an a-H transfer
of the alkylidene hydrogen onto Os leading to a high energy OsVIII
hydrido intermediate 5Q followed by the migration of the hydride
ligand to the remaining alkylidene ligand. The a-H transfer step
has an energy barrier of 36.5 kcal mol-1 and leads to 5Q, which
lies 27.8 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. Species 5Q evolves with
an energy barrier of 6.9 kcal mol-1 into the more stable 1Q-yne,
which lies 14.7 kcal mol-1 above (a,a)-1Q-bis-ene. Coordination
of the silanol stabilizes 1Q-yne either as square-based pyramid
[1Q-yne·SiOH-SBP] or trigonal bipyramid [1Q-yne·SiOH-TBP]
adducts, but they are still less stable than separated reactants by 6.2
and 8.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. The TBP adduct [1Q-yne·SiOH-
TBP] directly gives 2Q-yne and RCH3 via s-bond metathesis with
a relatively low energy barrier of 8.9 kcal mol-1. Alternatively,
H-transfer of the silanol to the alkylidyne ligand in [1Q-yne·SiOH-
SBP] gives 2Q-yne via 4aQ, but this step requires a much higher
energy barrier of 33.2 kcal mol-1.
Pathway 4.
The (a,a)-1-bis-ene can also give [1Q-yne·SiOH-
TBP] via a two-step process starting by an a-H transfer upon
coordination of silanol followed by a-H migration. The resulting
hexacoordinated intermediate [5Q·SiOH] lies 22.5 kcal mol-1 above
the separated reactants and requires a relatively high energy barrier
of 34.6 kcal mol-1, and it evolves into [1Q-yne·SiOH-TBP] with a
low barrier of 6.3 kcal mol-1. From this intermediate, 2Q-yne can
be obtained as described in Pathway 3.
Comparison between these grafting mechanisms is best carried
out considering Gibbs free energies (G) because of the change of
molecularities at different stages of the reaction pathways (values
in parenthesis in Schemes 3 and 4 plus Fig. 3). In the ﬁrst step
of Pathways 1, 2 and 4, the energies of the transition states
increase, because of the loss of translational entropy associated
with the participation of the silanol. In contrast, no such loss
of translational entropy affects the ﬁrst step of Pathway 3. As a
result, the activation energies of the ﬁrst step of Pathways 1 and 3
are comparable (within 1.5 kcal mol-1) and much lower that these
associated with Pathways 2 and 4 (6.5 and 12.4 kcal mol-1 higher
in free energies compared to Pathway 1, respectively).
Therefore, grafting of the bisalkylidene perhydrocarbyl complex
1-bis-ene to form the siloxy supported alkylidyne complex 2-yne
can take place via two accessible pathways (Pathways 1 and 3,

Free energy proﬁles for Pathways 1 and 3 and entry points
for Pathways 2 and 4. For Pathway 3, 1Q/SiO2 represents the most
stable pentacoordinated silanol adduct of 1Q-yne and corresponds to
1Q-yne-SiOH-SBP. All free energy values are given in parentheses with
respect to separated reactants ((a,a)-1-bis-ene and SiOH); parentheses with

Fig. 3). Both involve a s-bond metathesis between O–H and
M–alkyl bonds, occurring on either the bis-alkylidene (1-bis-ene)
or the alkyl alkylidyne complex (1-yne). The major difference be-
tween Pathways 1 and 3 is that the former implies a grafting process
associated with two elementary steps with high energy barriers
(33 and 31.5 kcal mol-1) while the latter has a rather ﬂat free
energy proﬁle, after a ﬁrst step requiring an activation barrier of
34.5 kcal mol-1. Experimental results showed the selective forma-
tion of 2-yne at room temperature and the absence of intermediates
like 2-bis-ene. Therefore, combining experimental and theoretical
data suggest that Pathway 3 is the most likely grafting process.
Note also that both kinetic and thermodynamic considerations
favour the formation of 2-yne upon reaction of 1-bis-ene with a
silanol.

Conclusion
Grafting
of
Os
bisalkylidene
complexes,
[Os(=CHtBu)2-
(CH2tBu)2], on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 ◦C se-
lectively yields an alkyl alkylidyne complex [(≡SiO)Os(≡CtBu)-
(CH2tBu)2] according to mass balance analysis, IR and solid
state NMR spectroscopies. However, only 30% of the surface
silanols react, independently of reaction time. The grafting process
corresponds to a replacement of one alkyl by a siloxy ligand
along with an isomerisation of the metal fragments from a bis-
alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne. DFT calculations show that
the bis-alkylidene is the energetically favoured isomer for the
perhydrocarbyl complex, while the alkyl alkylidyne isomer is more
stable when one of the strong s-donor alkyl ligands is replaced by
the weaker s-donor siloxy ligand. This also induces a change of
geometry from a distorted tetrahedron into a butterﬂy structure
having apical siloxy and alkylidyne ligands, and a lone pair
occupying the position of a ﬁfth coordination site. Investigation
of grafting reaction pathways shows that s-bond metathesis of
a metal–alkyl bond of either the bis-alkylidene complex or the
adsorbed alkyl alkylidyne isomer, stabilized by the coordination of
a silanol, is favoured; the latter being preferred because it involves
a rather ﬂat free energy proﬁle and because the bis-alkylidene
intermediate has not been experimentally observed. Note that the
surface chemistry of this d2 Os complex greatly differs from what
has been observed for d0 alkylidene complexes in several aspects:
for the latter (1) grafting involves either [1,2]-addition of the silanol
on the alkylidene (Ta37 and Re38) or direct s-bond metathesis
without isomerisation (Mo39,40 and W28), (2) grafting is typically
quantitative and (3) no major change of geometry/structure is
observed. This suggest that the low Os loading, independently of
reaction time and despite a highly favoured thermodynamic for
grafting, results from the different reactivity of surface silanols,
probably induced by their local environment, i.e. the presence or
not of neighboring siloxane bridges. The heterogeneity of silica
surfaces has been previously observed in related studies concerning
the formation of zirconium hydride surface species33c and the
presence of various sites in Cr-based polymerisation catalysts.41
Here, grafting leads to an isomerisation of the d2 ML4 fragment
from a tetrahedron into a butterﬂy structure, where a lone pair
occupies a ﬁfth coordination site. While this process could readily
occur on some more readily accessible silanols (30%), it could
be hindered for most sites (70%) having relatively close siloxane
bridges; the direct consequence being a lower metal loading. This
study provides more evidence for the heterogeneous environment
of silanols on amorphous silica surface, but further investigation
on the nature and the role of this heterogeneity on structure and
activity is clearly needed.
