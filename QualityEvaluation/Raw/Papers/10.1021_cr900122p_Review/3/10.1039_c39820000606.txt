conditions, of cycloalkanes by the bisphosphine rhenium 
heptahydrides (1) in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbutene (2) as 
a hydrogen acceptor. With cyclopentane, the heptahydride 
(lb)3 has been shown previously2 to lead to the cyclopenta- 
dienyl dihydride (6b);* we now find that with the higher 
homologues (4, n = 6, 7, 8) this system directly afiords the 
corresponding cycloalkenes (8). 
Thus, when cyclohexane (5 ml) was refluxed with (lb) 
(0.28 mmol) and (2) (2.8 mmol) for 1 h, cyclohexene was 
formed (0.07 mmol; 25% yield based on lb). Similarly, after 
heating at 80 “C for 1 h, cycloheptane gave cycloheptene 
(30%), and cyclo-octane gave cyclo-octene (65 %).t 
There appears to be a general trend towards more efficient 
dehydrogenation with more electron-releasing ligands in the 
heptahydride (1). This applies both to the formation of the 
cyclopentadienyl dihydrides (6) [the yields (by n.m.r.) of (6a),$ 
(6b),4 
and (6c)S were 10, 
25,2 and 45 %, respectively] and to the 
formation of cyclo-octene [50,65, 
and 80 % yield, respectively, 
using (la), (lb) and (lc)]. 
Processes involving radicals (i.e., abstraction of H’ 
from the 
cycloalkane), or free metal particles (e.g., colloidal rhenium), 
do not seem to be responsible for these dehydrogenations. 
Finely divided rhenium metal is very reactive and burns to the 
heptaoxide;e the yield of cjrclo-octene (65 %) from cyclo- 
octane and (lb) was unaffected, however, when the reaction 
was carried out in the presence of air, and cyclo-octene was 
still formed (30% yield) even when pure oxygen was bubbled 
through the mixture during the reaction. Furthermore, no 
bicyclohexyl, which would be expected in a reaction involving 
cyclohexyl radicals,’ could be detected in the reaction mixture 
from cyclohexane and (lb). Finally, it is interesting to note 
that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane stops at cyclohexene, 
whereas a reaction involving metallic rhenium would have 
been expected to lead to 
t In each of these experiments, the cyclo-olefin was separated 
from the excess of cycloalkane as its complex with AgSbF,, and 
identified by its mass spectrum and g.1.c. retention time. The 
yields reported were obtained by g.1.c. and are thought to be 
accurate to within about t 
5%. The organometallic component 
of the reaction mixture, which is soluble in acetone and dichloro- 
methane, has not yet been characterised. 
$ Authentic samples of (6a) [T(CD,CI,): 5.8 (5H, s, 75-C5H5) 
and 
20.5 (2H, t, J 40 Hz, ReH,)] and (6c) (T[(CD,),CO]: 5.85 (5H, s, 
T~-C,H,), 
7.75 (1 8H, s, Me), and 20.5 (2H, t, J 40 Hz, ReH,) } 
were prepared by the reaction4 between cyclopentadiene and (la) 
[T(CH,C~,): 
15.1 (t, J 18Hz)I and ( l ~ ) . ~  
Q A small amount (ca. 10%) of benzene was detected (g.1.c.) in the 
reaction between cyclohexane and (lb); this, however, must have 
been formed from (lb) and not from cyclohexane, since the 
dehydrogenation of cyclohexane using (lc) gave cyclohexene, 
toluene, and no benzene.

We therefore believe that these dehydrogenations proceed 
essentially according to the mechanism outlined in Scheme 1, 
the key step (3 + 
5) being the (reversible) oxidative addition 
of the cycloalkane to a co-ordinatively unsaturated inter- 
mediate such as (3), followed by (reversible) p-elimination 
(5 --f 7). Presumably, the larger cycloalkenes (8, n > 5) are 
more labile as ligands than cyclopentene, and dissociate from 
the metal before further reaction can occur, whereas cyclo- 
pentene undergoes further dehydrogenation to the cyclo- 
pentadienyl dihydrides (6). 
We thank the Compagnie des MCtaux PrCcieux for a 
generous loan of rhenium.
