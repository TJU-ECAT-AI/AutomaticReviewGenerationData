Abstract
The present short review article reports four examples of catalytic reactions realised on relatively well-deﬁned supported catalysts. These
catalysts were conceptually designed and prepared by a Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach. They were designed for
achieving the oleﬁn metathesis reaction, the Ziegler–Natta depolymerisation, the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes and the alkane
metathesis reaction. These reactions are “related” to the metathesis of inert bonds. The ﬁrst example is the silica-supported rhenium (VII)
carbene species [(≡Si–O)–Re(≡C-t-Bu)(=CH-t-Bu)(CH2-t-Bu)] obtained by grafting Re(≡C-t-Bu)(=CH-t-Bu)(CH2-t-Bu)2 on silica. This
catalyst has turned out to be very active in the propene metathesis reaction (initial T.O.F. = 0.25 mol/mol Re/s) after an initiation step
involving a cross-metathesis reaction between the neopentylidene ligand and propene.
The silica or silica–alumina-supported zirconium hydride(s) catalyse(s) the “depolymerisation” of polyethylene into lower oligomers and
“diesel range hydrocarbons”. The depolymerisation reaction mechanism involves a -alkyl transfer which is the microscopic reverse of the
“Cossee” mechanism of oleﬁn insertion into a metal alkyl bond. Moreover, in the case of low-density branched polyethylenes (LDBP), the
cleavage of the polymer chain occurs preferentially on the branches of the initial polymer. Therefore, the branched initial polyethylene is
transformed into a linear one. Besides, recent advances in NMR spectroscopic techniques have highlighted that the zirconium hydride catalyst
contains in fact two surface species: a zirconium monohydride (major) and a zirconium dihydride (minor).
The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(≡SiO)2Ta–H], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(≡SiO)2ZrH2] and [(≡SiO)3Zr–H]
both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metals—tantalum hydride is able to
cleave the C–C bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not. In fact, the C–C bond cleavage reactions go through different pathways:
in the case of Zr the pathway of C–C bond cleavage obeys a -alkyl transfer mechanism while, in the case of Ta, another pathway is required,
which involves either -bond metathesis, oxidative addition or carbene mechanism. Notably, the tantalum hydride catalyst has also been
found to be active in the alkane metathesis reaction. During this reaction, two different processes occur simultaneously: the productive alkane
metathesis which leads to higher and lower alkane homologues and the scrambling of the initial alkane reagent.

1. Introduction
Catalysis is primarily a molecular phenomenon, since it
implies the transformation of molecules into other molecules
independently of phase consideration (homogeneous or het-
erogeneous). In heterogeneous catalysis, the level of un-
derstanding is still limited because it is usually difﬁcult to
achieve a reliable “structure-activity” relationship. This dif-

ﬁculty arises from the small number of active site(s), a con-
cept already introduced in 1927 by Taylor [1]. Despite the
impressive number of current physico-chemical tools avail-
able to characterise surfaces at an atomic and molecular
level, the detection of these active sites is extremely difﬁcult
either as such or under working catalytic conditions (detec-
tion of reaction intermediates).
In order to achieve a higher level of understanding and
eventually ﬁnd new catalytic systems, it is necessary to pre-
pare on surfaces well-deﬁned active sites uniform in com-
position and distribution, and thereby generate “single-site”
heterogeneous catalysts. This objective is most crucial for

the catalytic reactions, which are difﬁcult to achieve either
in homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis, and eventually
it might help to discover new catalytic reactions, which do
not exist either in homogeneous, heterogeneous or even en-
zymatic reactions!
The strategy to make these well-deﬁned active sites is
based on a number of hypotheses:
• Firstly, it is necessary to enter the catalytic cycle via a
postulated reaction intermediate (or one of its immediate
precursor). Preferably it is necessary to draw a reasonable
mechanism derived from molecular organometallic chem-
istry and focus on the crucial stable intermediate (when
the sites are well-deﬁned and in high concentrations on
the surface, it is possible, in principle, to study elementary
steps and determine those reaction intermediates). This
concept may seem obvious in homogeneous catalysis,
but it is not the general rule in heterogeneous catalysis.
Classically in heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst, which
may be an oxide, a sulphide, a carbide. . . or a metal par-
ticle, “goes through” one or several intermediates of the
“catalytic cycle” by means of the reaction of the reagents
and products with the surface. A typical example is the
oxidation of propene by molecular oxygen on Bi-Mo
catalysts [2,3] whose mechanism has been rationalised a
posteriori.
• Secondly, one has to consider the surface as a classi-
cal ligand of co-ordination chemistry such as X-, L- or
Z-ligands in the Green formalism. Doing so, one has
access to formal oxidation state, electron conﬁguration
and electron count of the active metal. Typical examples
are given in Scheme 1. Interestingly, by considering the
surface as a classical ligand of co-ordination chemistry,
it is possible to make electron counts in the same way as
in molecular chemistry. This is important since it allows
to predict the reactivity of the active site and the mecha-
nism by which it will operate (oxidative addition, -bond
metathesis, etc.. . . ).
• Thirdly, one may eventually use “spectator” ligands
“above” the surface in order to tune the activity, the
selectivity and the life time.
• Fourthly, like for enzyme, one may also control the hy-
drophobicity or hydrophilicity of the local environment
[4] via the presence of organic ligands on the surface
at the vicinity of the catalytic site. Several examples
developed in the laboratory are given in Scheme 2.
• Finally, one has to prove surface structures of relevant
catalytic intermediates with the accuracy of both molec-
ular and solid state chemistry. This is also a critical
point because these two “scientiﬁc communities” have
not communicated enough between each other and have
implemented their own “preference” for tools. However,

working with well-deﬁned surface systems allows to
use physical characterisation techniques very efﬁciently
(reliable data) since it is easier to understand a single
species than a myriad of them. For example, on single site
systems, EXAFS and/or XANES provide reliable coordi-
nation numbers, while it is usually a major difﬁculty for
these techniques on ill-deﬁned systems. Regarding solid
state NMR, which is also a quite demanding technique
(because of its low sensibility), it has been developed into
an extremely powerful tool for structural characterisa-
tion of inorganic or organic solids, macromolecules and
even proteins. Advanced solid state NMR techniques (2D
HETCOR, J-resolved and DQ NMR) have been recently
implemented in our laboratory in collaboration with the
Laboratoire de Chimie in the Ecole Normale Supérieure
de Lyon (Prof. Emsley) and has allowed us to observe
surface carbenes or carbynes (2D HETCOR) [5], agos-
tic interaction (J-resolved 2D NMR) [5] and zirconium
dihydrides (DQ 1H NMR) [6].
This approach has been called the Surface Organometallic
Chemistry (SOMC) [7]. This discipline of chemistry con-
sists in bringing the concepts and the experimental tools of
molecular chemistry, especially organometallic chemistry,
to surface science and heterogeneous catalysis.
Pioneering work started in the 1960 in polymer chem-
istry, but SOMC, in its present form, really addresses the
structure of the active sites, its reactivity and its fate during
catalysis in order to develop and improve catalysts through
structure-activity correlation.
In relation with the meeting “metathesis of oleﬁns and
related reactions” (ISOM XV, Kyoto, July 2003), we have
focused on the recent advances in Surface Organometal-
lic Chemistry applied to the metathesis of oleﬁns, but
also look at the metathesis of more inert bonds, such as
C–H, C–C and H–H bonds (elementary steps involved
in the low temperature hydrogenolysis and metathesis of
alkanes).
As examples, we describe herein the characterisation and
catalytic properties of three highly active and selective cat-
alysts prepared via the Surface Organometallic Chemistry
method developed in the laboratory:
I Silica-supported rhenium carbene species for oleﬁn
metathesis.
II Silica–alumina-supported zirconium hydride for poly-
ethylene depolymerisation.
III Silica-supported tantalum hydride for alkane hydro-
genolysis and alkane metathesis.
I. Silica-supported rhenium carbene species for
oleﬁns metathesis
Some of the ﬁrst oleﬁn metathesis catalysts have been
prepared by British Petroleum scientists by impregnation of
rhenium(VII) oxide on alumina [8–11]. These Re2O7/Al2O3
catalyst has been extensively studied as it shows a high ac-
tivity in oleﬁn metathesis at low temperatures (273–373 K)
even with some functionalised oleﬁns [12]. Noteworthy,
only 2% of the supported rhenium is actually active [13]
in the desired reaction. This is probably related to the
very speciﬁc environment of the active site, which requires
probably the proximity of the rhenium atom with a highly
acidic aluminium sites of the support. This dual system is
necessary both for the “initiation” reaction, formation of the
metallocarbene, and the “propagation” reaction. The dra-
matical inﬂuence of the support acidity has been conﬁrmed
by the absence of any catalytic activity of Re2O7 supported
on silica, a rather non acidic support [14–18].
As metallocarbenes have been recognised as key interme-
diates in oleﬁn metathesis, the SOMC approach dictates the
need to generate a supported rhenium carbene covalently
linked to an oxide support [19–22]. This would present the
obvious advantage of avoiding the initiation step of the met-
allocarbene, a still unknown pathway on the classical het-
erogeneous catalysts. As complexes of rhenium(VII) having
a d0-conﬁguration [23] and containing alkylidene ligands
[24–30] are some of the best catalysts for oleﬁn metathesis in
homogeneous catalytic systems, it has been decided to gen-
erate a rhenium(VII) carbene supported on silica by grafting
Re(≡C-t-Bu)(=CH-t-Bu)(CH2-t-Bu)2 [31–33] on the sur-
face silanol groups [34]. The choice of an alkyl precursor
is particularly indicated, given the well-known clean graft-
ing reaction undergone by such species. Typically, an alkyl
precursor reacts with the silica surface’s reacting silanols,
by elimination of an alkane molecule and the concomitant
formation of a (≡Si–O–M) bond.
Effectively Re(≡C-t-Bu)(=CH-t-Bu)(CH2-t-Bu)2 reacts
with silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 ◦C. By using
this dehydroxylation temperature, the reactive sites of the
surface consist mainly in isolated silanols. As expected, the
grafting reaction leads to the monografted supported species
1 (see Scheme 3(a)) by elimination of one equivalent of
neopentane.
This ﬁrst example of silica-supported rhenium (VII)
carbene–carbyne complexe 1 was fully characterized by
EXAFS (see Scheme 3(b)), NMR spectroscopies (see
Scheme 3(c)) (1D 13C and 1H, 2D HETCOR and J resolved
solid state NMR), IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis
[34].
This well-deﬁned rhenium heterogeneous catalyst, pre-
pared via Surface Organometallic Chemistry was found to
be very active in oleﬁn metathesis. When 500 equivalents
of propene are contacted with 1 at 25 ◦C the equilibrium
with the products of metathesis is reached within less than
one hour (see Fig. 1(a), curve 1) and the initial T.O.F. is
0.25 mol/mol Re/s [34].
As reported in Table 1, these catalytic performances are
comparable to those observed with the best classical hetero-
geneous catalysts.
Moreover, the evolvement of one equivalent of a 1:3 mix-
ture of 3,3-dimethylbutene and 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene (see
Fig. 1(a), curve 2 and 3), during the ﬁrst hour of reaction,

gives a clear molecular insight into the activation process of
the rhenium catalyst by a cross-metathesis reaction between
the alkylidene ligand and the propene (see Fig. 1(b)).
II. Silica–alumina-supported zirconium hydride for polyethy-
lene depolymerisation
In the 1950’s, Ziegler and Natta discovered that transition
metals could catalyse the polymerisation of propylene or

ethylene giving access to new parafﬁnic polymers [35–38].
This discovery led to a large scale production of valuable,
but non biodegradable polymers. In order to solve the envi-
ronmental problem of polymer waste, the depolymerisation
of these polyoleﬁns into oleﬁnic oligomers, monomers or
useful chemicals is an important ﬁeld. A SOMC approach
of this subject of interest requires a molecular level under-
standing of the target reaction.
As the Ziegler–Natta polymerisation is based on consec-
utive insertions of oleﬁns in a metal–alkyl bond [39,40],
the depolymerisation reaction could involve successive
de-insertions of oleﬁns from the metal-alkyl catalyst (see
Scheme 4(a)).
In terms of mechanism, the insertion of an oleﬁn in a
metal–alkyl bond (elementary step of the Ziegler–Natta
polymerisation; the well known “Cossee” mechanism) is
the microscopic reverse of the -alkyl transfer [41–53]
(see Scheme 4(b)). It should be, therefore, possible to use
the principle of microreversibility to drive the equilibrated

elementary step in the reverse direction: -alkyl transfer.
As the oleﬁn polymerisation is thermodynamically very
favoured at moderate temperature, the reverse reaction of
depolymerisation is really disfavoured at low or moderate
temperatures. Therefore, the depolymerisation of poly-
oleﬁns is a very challenging goal!
In order to overcome this depolymerisation thermody-
namic gap energy (see Scheme 4(b)), it is necessary to cou-
ple the desired unfavourable reaction, with a highly favoured
one, which would drive the overall system in the required
direction. The hydrogenation of the double bond formed
in the depolymerisation can be the solution. The overall
reaction would become an hydrogenolysis of an “alkane
macromolecule” to produce lower alkanes. Such favourable
thermodynamic balance will be the driving force for the
-alkyl transfer involved in the depolymerisation step (see
Scheme 5).
The catalyst system able to achieve such kind of reaction
should therefore be able to polymerise oleﬁns. We chose a
silica or silica alumina zirconium hydride-supported species,
which were good candidates to fulﬁl these requirements (in-
sertion of oleﬁns [54–61], alkane hydrogenolysis [62–64]).
Since 1991, the silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst
have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirco-
nium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica
followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reac-

tions lead to the formation of (≡SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66]
as the major supported species (see Scheme 6(a)).
Zirconium hydride species has been analysed by different
techniques: IR spectroscopy, EXAFS, 1D NMR spectro-
scopies (1H and 13C solid state NMR), GC analysis [66].
Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy tech-
niques have allowed us to identify another supported species
which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless
signiﬁcant amounts on the surface: (≡SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6].
In particular, the characterisation of 3b has been made
possible thanks to the development of a 1H 2D double quanta
solid state NMR sequence, whose spectra present correlation
signals for protons undergoing dipolar through-space inter-
actions with other close spins. Therefore, such a sequence
permits to identify isolated protons from non-isolated ones.
For the silica-supported zirconium hydrides described above,
it has been possible to identify and assign two types of hy-
dride resonances: at 10 and 12 ppm to a monohydride and a
dihydride, respectively [6].
The 2D double quanta NMR spectroscopy also high-
lighted the spatial proximity of the hydrogenosilane species
and the zirconium monohydride. These data have ascer-
tained the mechanism of the formation of the zirconium
hydrides (see Scheme 6(b)), which involves opening the
siloxane bridges and formation of (Zr–O–Si) and (Si–H)
bonds close to each other.
These two well-deﬁned zirconium hydride complexes
supported on silica–alumina [67], already known to catal-
yse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been
also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]. The
depolymerisation reaction can readily be monitored by IR
spectroscopy.
For example, a mixture of 3a and 3b exposed to an ethy-
lene pressure (200 Torr, room temperature) leads to the for-
mation of polyethylene as observed by IR spectroscopy: the
appearance of very intense bands characteristic of polyethy-
lene [70] (2970–2850 cm−1) and the concomitant decrease
of the band (1635 cm−1) attributed to (Zr–H) vibrations
(see Fig. 2). This polymerisation takes place via the inser-
tion of ethylene into the Zr–H bond to yield Zr–Et bond, fol-
lowed by multiple insertions of ethylene into the Zr–C bond.
Upon heating this supported polymer at 150 ◦C overnight
under H2, the IR spectrum shows the disappearance of
the aliphatic chains bands ((C–H) 2970–2850 cm−1 and

(C–H) 1380 cm−1) and the regeneration of the (Zr–H) vi-
bration band (see Fig. 2), thus demonstrating the reversibil-
ity of this process under hydrogen and the possibility to
depolymerise polyoleﬁns.
The depolymerisation properties of this catalyst have
been further studied by contacting commercial low-density
polyethylene
(LDPE)
to

species 3a and 3b under 1 bar of hydrogen at 150 ◦C.
For example, this LDPE, initially composed of 2–3 long
branches/1000 carbons and 11 butyl branches/1000 car-
bons with Mn = 19,000 and a large polydispersity index
(Ip = 7), was transformed into a linear polymer having a
higher molecular weight (Mn = 42,000) and a lower Ip
value (Ip = 4). The gas phase of the reaction mixture was
composed of 46% (weight) of C1 to C8 linear alkanes.
During this process, the LDPE molecular weight number
distribution becomes narrower with disappearance of the
lower molecular weight numbers, which is consistent with
the hydrogenolysis of the branches [71]. This was further
conﬁrmed by 13C NMR spectroscopy on the resulting poly-
mer which shows the disappearance of the signals attributed
to the carbons composing the butyl and the longer branches
of the polymer (see Fig. 3) [71].
Based on these results, a mechanism involving a
-alkyl-transfer as the key step of the polymer cleavage can
be postulated (see Scheme 7):
• activation of one C–H bond of the polymer by the zirco-
nium hydride catalyst leading to Zr-alkyl species;
• formation of a Zr-alkyl species having a -alkyl branch
through consecutive -H eliminations and oleﬁn reinser-
tion;
• -alkyl branch elimination to obtain an alkyl-alkene zir-
conium complex;
• hydrogenation of the Zr-alkyl bond to yield the Zr–H
species;

III. Silica-supported tantalum hydride for alkane
hydrogenolysis and alkane metathesis
Alkane
hydrogenolysis
[72]
and
alkane
metathesis
[73–75] are catalysed by tantalum hydride species. Such
species are prepared by impregnation of the [Ta(=CHtBu)
(CH2tBu)3], on partially dehydroxylated silica at room tem-
perature (see Scheme 8). The resulted supported complex
4 has been fully characterized by IR spectroscopy, ele-
mental analysis, GC analysis, 1H and 13C solid state NMR
spectroscopies and EXAFS [73].
The well-deﬁned tantalum hydride disiloxy-species 5 has
been consecutively obtained by treatment of 4 under hydro-
gen at 150 ◦C (see Scheme 9) [73] and has been character-
ized by IR and NMR spectroscopies.
This supported species [(≡SiO)2TaH] (5) is an active
catalyst for alkane hydrogenolysis [72], just as silica-
supported group 4 hydrides (≡SiO)3M–H (M = Ti, Zr,
Hf) [53,64,66,76], which readily catalyse acyclic alkane
hydrogenolysis and polyethylene depolymerisation [69] (as
aforementioned). In contrast with these group 4 catalysts,

which yield methane/ethane mixtures as ﬁnal products, the
tantalum-supported species produces only methane as ﬁ-
nal product independently from the nature of the linear or
branched initial alkane.
With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of
this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [41–53] as
the key step of the C–C bond cleavage (vida supra). Since,
the tantalum hydride-supported species converts alkanes in-
cluding ethane into methane at 150 ◦C, this rules out the
-methyl transfer as the unique C–C bond cleavage mech-
anism in the case of tantalum. Further conﬁrmation of this
unique reactivity was obtained by studying the hydrogenol-
ysis of 2,2-dimethylbutane catalysed by zirconium hydrides
(3a and 3b) and tantalum hydride (5) complexes. The com-
parison of the primary products evolved in the gas phase
showed that 3a and 3b lead to isopentane [77] (which can be
explained by a -methyl transfer pathway (see Scheme 10)
as major product of higher alkanes while 5 produces neopen-
tane (which can not be obtained by a -alkyl transfer) (see
Scheme 10).
This comparison clearly shows that another process for
the C–C bond cleavage takes place during the alkane hy-
drogenolysis reaction catalysed by a tantalum-supported
species with respect to group 4 catalysts. We suggest that a
possible mechanism of the C–C bond cleavage involves a
four centred transition state although many other elemen-
tary steps may also be explained by an oxidative addition

followed by reductive elimination or a carbene mechanism
(see Scheme 11).
Besides
alkane
hydrogenolysis,
the
silica-supported
(≡Si–O–Si≡)(≡SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses “alkane metathe-
sis”, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction
transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and
lower homologues [74,75]. For example, Fig. 4 represents
the distribution of the various products (at 3% conversion)
evolved during the metathesis of the ﬁrst linear alkanes
catalysed by 5 at 150 ◦C.
The simplest case is the metathesis of ethane. Since this
molecule has only one C–C bond, it does not present any
problem of selectivity. The products of the reaction are
mostly propane (44%(mol)) and methane (53%(mol)) in nearly
equal amounts with trace amounts of butane (2.4%(mol))
and isobutane (0.6%(mol)). Thanks to 13C labelling experi-
ments using monolabelled ethane as reagent and to GC–MS
analysis, the evolvement of unlabelled, mono-, di- and tril-
abelled propane during the reaction is observed. These re-
sults prove the redistribution of the 13C atoms in the propane
molecules and thus, the cleavage of 13C–12C bond of the
ethane. These experiments also reveal the presence of an ad-
ditional faster process occurring simultaneously to the for-
mation of propane. Monolabelled ethane is converted into
an 1:1 mixture of unlabelled and dilabelled ethane (see
Scheme 12). Such scrambling process can be considered
as a “degenerative metathesis” [75], in contrast with the

nes. This unproductive reaction has a rate which is ca. ﬁve
times faster than the productive metathesis reaction.
In order to explain the productive and the degenerative
metathesis, a speciﬁc mechanism of C–C bond cleavage
and formation can be suggested such as a four centred
-bond metathesis transition state, an oxidative addi-
tion/reductive elimination pathway or a carbenic mechanism
(see Scheme 11).

2. Conclusion
The SOMC method developed in the laboratory, whose
strategy is a molecular approach to heterogeneous catalysis,
has allowed us to design, construct on a surface well-deﬁned
catalysts for desired reactions. Some were known and other
were unknown. This approach allowed to increase the level
of understanding of the mechanisms involved in various cat-
alytic reactions.
As example, we have reported here the synthesis, charac-
terisation and catalytic activities of three different tailored
supported transition metal catalysts, as well as recent ad-
vances in the understanding of the catalyst formation and of
the catalytic reaction mechanisms.

activity has been found to be high at moderate temperatures
(initial T.O.F. = 0.25 mol/mol Re/s). The reaction equi-
librium is rapidly reached (within less than one hour) and

the catalyst activation process has been elucidated: it is a
cross-metathesis reaction of the neopentylidene ligand with
the propene.
The well-deﬁned silica–alumina-supported zirconium
monohydride (as the major species) and dihydride species
[(≡SiO)3ZrH and (≡SiO)2ZrH2] have been synthesised
and characterized thanks to recent spectroscopic develop-
ments. These supported catalysts have been found to be
very active in the polyethylene depolymerisation reaction.
This depolymerisation occurs in presence of hydrogen via
a mechanism involving a -alkyl transfer elementary step.
The third well-deﬁned supported species reported above
was the tantalum hydride catalyst [(≡SiO)2TaH]. It has been
tested in the alkane hydrogenolysis reaction. As the group
4 transition metal catalysts, it catalyses this reaction, but
shows a particular activity: it catalytically hydrogenolyzes
ethane into methane. This proves that the mechanism of
the alkane hydrogenolysis reaction catalysed by tantalum
hydride differs from the mechanism proposed for group 4
catalysts. The silica-supported tantalum hydride species is
also active in the metathesis of alkane, which transforms an
alkane into its higher and lower homologues. This catalytic
reaction has been studied using a monolabelled ethane
reagent. In particular, these experiments have shown the
presence of a simultaneous unproductive reaction during
the ethane metathesis process, which consists in a scram-
bling of ethane. The mechanism of the alkane metathesis
(productive or not) can be related to that of the alkane hy-
drogenolysis catalysed by the supported tantalum hydride.
It can be based on a Carbon–Carbon -bond metathesis
and the formation of a four centred transition intermediate.
Nevertheless an oxidative addition followed by a reductive
elimination pathway or a carbenic mechanism cannot be
excluded.
