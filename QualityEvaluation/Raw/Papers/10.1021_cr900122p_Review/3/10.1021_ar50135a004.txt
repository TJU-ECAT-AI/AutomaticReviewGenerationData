phenylhydrazones 24 and 25. When rats were treated 
with NNN, 73-8570 of the dose was excreted in the 
urine, but 20 and 21 were not detected. However, 
products of further oxidation of 20 and 21, the keto acid 
23, hydroxy acid 26, and lactone 27 were isolated. The 
formation of 20 and 21 in vitro is most readily explained 
by initial 2’-hydroxylation or 5’-hydroxylation of NNN, 
as indicated in Scheme IV. The metabolites 23, 26, and 
27 were formed, at least partially, by metabolic oxi- 
dation of 20 and 21. Pathways other than an initial 
a-hydroxylation of NNN could have been involved in 
the formation of 23,26, and 27, which are also observed 
in the metabolism of nicotine.69 
The results of these in vitro and in vivo experiments 
demonstrate that both NPy and NNN undergo met- 
abolic a-hydroxylation in the rat. The mutagenicity 
data discussed above are consistent with the involve- 
ment of a-hydroxylation as the critical step in the 
metabolic activation of NPy and NNN. Further evi- 
dence on the role of a-hydroxylation in the activation 
of these compounds is currently being sought through 
carcinogenicity studies of a-deuterated NNN deriva- 
tives and through studies of the binding of NPy and 
NNN to DNA and RNA of target tissues. 
Prospects 
The results described in this review indicate that the 
tobacco-specific carcinogens, NNN and NNK, may be 
causative factors in the various cancers associated with 
tobacco usage. These nitrosamines are derived pre- 
dominantly from the major tobacco alkaloid, nicotine, 
by nitrosation during the curing and smoking of to- 
bacco. Other tobacco alkaloids may also be precursors 
to carcinogenic nitrosamines. Since NNN and NNK 
form during curing, it is feasible to reduce their con- 
centrations in tobacco by appropriate management of

J., Ed.; Vol. 6; Academic Press: New York, 1975, p 35. 
the curing and related processes. Formation during 
smoking can also be inhibited. The reduction of these 
and related nitrosamines in tobacco and tobacco smoke 
is one approach to reduce tobacco-related cancers. 
A second approach begins with an understanding of 
the metabolic activation and detoxification of tobac- 
co-specific nitrosamines. The enzymes that mediate 
these transformations can be induced or inhibited by 
environmental modifiers. Such modifiers may increase 
or decrease the carcinogenic effects of these nitros- 
amines. NNN and NPy, as well as NNK, all undergo 
metabolic a-hydroxylation which is a likely activation 
process. Specific induction of a-hydroxylation could 
lead to greater carcinogenic activity; the modifier 
causing this would act as a cocarcinogen. Similarly, 
specific inhibition of a-hydroxylation could have a 
protective effect against carcinogenesis by these ni- 
trosamines. The identification of these modifiers 
through metabolic studies and bioassays is important 
for a more complete characterization of the causative 
factors in tobacco carcinogenesis and for the prevention 
of tobacco-related cancer. 
Recently ”-nitrosoan- 
atabine, another tobacco-specific N-nitrosamine, has 
been identified in tobacco (0.6-13 ppm), cigarette smoke 
(0.33-4.6 hg/cig), and cigarette sidestream smoke 
(0.15-1.5 pg/cig).70 Data on the carcinogenic activity 
of this nitrosamine are not yet available.

ligands are not “stabilized” by a heteroatom substituent 
and the complexes therefore are more reactive. They 
(especially primary alkylidene complexes) had been 
postulated for several years as intermediates in the 
decomposition of transition-metal alkyl complexes3

(2) The alkylidene nomenclature is a useful, less misleading alternative 
to the carbene nomenclature. An alkylidene is derived from an alkyl ligand 
by removing an a-hydrogen atom. A primary alkylidene is derived from 
a primary alkyl ligand, methylene being a unique member of this family. 
A secondary alkylidene (or disubstituted methylene) is derived from a 
secondary alkyl ligand.

plexes in the sense that they are 18-electron species, 
contain a metal in formally the 0 or +1 
oxidation state, 
have at least one “stabilizing” 
resonance form, and react 
with nucleophiles at C, of the alkylidene ligand. 
In 1974 a 10-electron Ta (formally 3f) neopentyl- 
idene complex was isolated as the product of decom- 
position of a Ta5+ 
neopentyl complex by loss of neo- 
pentane. 
This novel intramolecular “a-hydrogen 
abstraction” reaction has since been used to prepare a 
fairly large class of Ta (and Nb) neopentylidene and 
benzylidene complexes while an extension of the 
principle of a abstraction provided the first example 
of a stable transition-metal methylene complex. It thus 
became possible to structurally and spectroscopically 
characterize and systematically study the fundamental 
reactions of a number of related Nb and Ta alkylidene 
complexes. In the process we have begun to understand 
some aspects of the a-abstraction process by which they 
are formed, why they are stable, how these findings 
relate to the chemistry of other transition-metal alkyl 
complexes, and to what extent this chemistry is related 
to that of the main group cousins of Nb and Ta, namely, 
P, As, and Sb.

is that thermally unstable 1 
forms 
.in the first, relatively slow step of the reaction. It then 
“decomposes” by losing neopentane to give unstable 2 
which reacts with LiCH2CMe3 
to give 3; both steps are 
fast relative to the first. The crucial a-hydrogen ab- 
straction step (1 - 
2) is discussed in detail later. One 
of the most important requirements is that the tran- 
sition-metal alkyl precursor be a crowded molecule. 
Substitution of a chloride ligand with an v5-cyclo- 
pentadienyl ligand will induce a-hydrogen abstraction 
in neopentyl and benzyl complexes to give neo- 
pentylidene complexes (4,13 
5,14 
or 815a) 
or benzylidene 
complexes (916 
or 1014), 
respectively (Scheme I). The 
success of this approach depends on the type of cy- 
clopentadienyl group; for example, Ta(

Addition of a neutral ligand such as PMe3 
to an alkyl 
complex will also induce a-hydrogen abstraction. An 
example is 6.I; As we will see later, the primary role 
of PMe3 (like a cyclopentadienyl ligand) is to create a 
crowded coordination sphere and/or a geometry in 
which a abstraction is easier. 
In contrast, addition of one r5-C5H5 
to TaMe3C12 
gives 
TaCpMe3C1, and addition of a second gives TaCpzMe3 
(11). In fact, no example of a strictly thermally pro- 
moted a-abstraction reaction in a methyl complex to 
give a stable methylene complex (e.g., 11 - 
13) is 
known, partly because the methylene complex (e.g., 13) 
decomposes as fast as it is formed (see below). This 
problem can be circumvented, however, by making use 
of the analogy between main-group and transition-metal 
group 5 elements. 
Treating 11 with trityl tetra- 
fluoroborate gives the “tantalonium” salt 12, which is 
deprotonated smoothly by a base (the cleanest of which 
is a phosphorane) to give 13 in high yield.18 It is the 
only known transition-metal methylene complex. 
By now the reader will have noticed that none of the 
alkyls we have mentioned (CH3, 
CH2Ph, 
or CH2CMe3) 
has any @-hydrogen 
atoms. What is known at present 
about decomposition of transition-metal alkyl com- 
plexes would lead one to predict that a @-hydrogen 
atom 
will always be lost more readily than an a-hydrogen 
atom,,* especially if the metal complex has less than an 
18-valence-electron 
count. Hence techniques other than 
a abstraction or deprotonation must be used to prepare, 
for example, an ethylidene complex. 
Alkylidene 
transfer is potentially useful in this regard. The labile 
PMe3 ligand in TaCp2(PMe3) 
(CH,) is replaced by 
Et3P=CHMe to form the postulated intermediate 
“ylide complex” 14, 
which then loses PEt3 
to give 1519

method other complexes which probably could not be 
prepared by an a-abstraction route. 
In general, these Nb and Ta alkylidene complexes 
react with even traces of oxygen or water (or other 
protic solvents), although sterically crowded 18-electron 
complexes like TaCp2(CHCMe3)C1 
can be handled as

solids briefly in air. These are also the most stable 
thermally (TaCp2(CHCMe3)C1 
is stable in refluxing 
toluene). The least stable thermally are methylene 
complexes like 13 or relatively uncrowded complexes 
like 2, probably since at least one decomposition 
pathway is bimolecular to form the olefin (see below). 
In general, Nb complexes appear to be less stable, 
thermally and hydrolytically, than their Ta analogues. 
Spectroscopic Characterization 
13C NMR spectroscopy is invaluable for character- 
izing alkylidene complexes since the alkylidene C, 
resonance invariably is found at low field (200-300 ppm 
downfield of Me,Si). This large chemical shift appears 
to be characteristic of many types of carbon atoms 
which are multiply bonded to some extent to a tran- 
sition meta120 
but for reasons which are not yet clear.21 
One important finding is that lJCH, 
varies widely. Low 
values (75-100 Hz) are found in neopentylidene and 
benzylidene complexes which have less than 18 valence 
electrons (e.g., Ta(v5-C5Me5)(CHCMe3)(CH2CMe3)C1 
= 
14 e, IJCH, = 76 Hz16), 
while higher values (105-130 Hz) 
are found in the 18-electron complexes, MCp,(CHR) (X) 
(R = CMe3, Ph, H; X = C1, CH2Ph, and CH3, 
re~pectivelyl~). 
A second, potentially important result is that the 
location of the ‘H NMR signal for H, varies from T -2 
to 12. It is found at lowest fields in the 18-electron 
complexes, MCp2(CHR)(X). 
A third interesting feature is that the C-H, stretching 
frequency is surprisingly low in the electron deficient 
(<18 
e) complexes. In TaCp(CHCMe3)Clz, 
for example, 
it is found at 2510 cm-l (weak).15” A similar peak is 
found in the IR spectra of many other electron-deficient 
alkylidene complexes, but notably not in the spectra of 
the 18-electron complexes, MCp,(CHR)X. A low value 
for vCH, therefore correlates with a low value for IJcH,. 
Siructure and Bonding 
The structures of three 18-electron complexes are 
known. TaCpz(CHz)(CH3)22 
is shown in Figure 1. 
Some pertinent structural data for TaCp(CH2)(CH3), 
and for the related molecules, TaCpz(CHPh)(CH2Ph)14 
and TaCp2(CHCMe3)C1,23 
can be found in Table I. 
The Ta=C(alkylidene) bond length is rather short 
in each case (-0.22 A shorter than the respective Ta-C 
single bonds in the first two molecules) and suggestive 
of a significant amount of multiple bonding between Ta 
and C,(alkylidene). Since the r-bonding orbital in

complexes lies in the plane 
passing between the two Cp rings,z4 the alkylidene 
ligand must be oriented perpendicular to that plane (6’ 
= 90’) in order to allow overlap of the metal ?
r
 orbital 
with the carbon 2p, orbital. This is sterically possible 
only for the methylene ligand (6’ = 88 f 
3”; Table I). 
The phenyl ring of the benzylidene ligand is turned 
toward the -CH2Ph 
ligand (6’ = 96’) while the tert-butyl 
group in the neopentylidene ligand is turned away from 
the chloride (6’ = 80’). Interestingly, the methylene 
ligand does not readily turn into the plane but the 
benzylidene and neopentylidene ligands do, with AGlrOt 
values which are inversely proportional to the extent 
which the alkylidene ligand planes deviate from the 
perpendicular (6 and lo’, respectively). If we assume 
that the different AG*mt 
values reflect energy differences 
in the ground state rather than the transition state with 
=CHR “in the plane”, then we can make two state- 
ments. The fact that AGlrOt 
is so sensitive to how much 
6’ deviates from 90’ suggests that the overlap between 
metal and carbon a-type orbitals is poor. Secondly, 
since there is arguably no orthogonal ?r-bonding 
orbital 
of relatively low energy in MCpzL2 
the 
maximum value for AGSrOt 
is an approximate measure 
of the strength of the metal-alkylidene a bond. We 
estimate this to be 25 kcal 
Ta-C single bond 
strengths are on the order of 40-60 kcal m01-1.3a 
Therefore the total alkylidene-metal bond strength (AH 
for dissociation to give a free carbene) is on the order 
of at least 75 kcal mol-I. 
The alkylidene Ta-C,-CB angles in TaCpz(CHPh)- 
(CH2Ph) and TaCp2(CHCMe3)C1 
are progressively 
larger than might be expected for an sp2-hybridized 
C, 
(Table I). Presumably steric factors play a significant 
role in opening up this angle in =CHR complexes as 
the size of R increases. A consequence is that M-C,-H, 
must decrease. Interestingly, so does ~ J c H ,

larger (161’), and the Ta-C,-H,

longer than that predicted26 (1.120 A) for a pure C- 
(2p)-H(ls) bond, and much longer than a C(sp2)-H(ls) 
bond. This reasonably explains the low values for ‘JcH, 
and vCH .17 Surprisingly, the Ta=C bond is much 
shorter than in 18-electron complexes, not much longer, 
in fact, than the Ta=C bond length found in an al-

molecule (the steric effect); the two operate synergis- 
tically in electron-deficient (less than 18 electron)

“semibridging” a-hydrogen atom. We can now un- 
derstand how an alkylidene a-hydrogen atom can be 
removed to give the alkylidyne complex mentioned

coordinates to the electron-poor metal first. C, then 
attacks one end of the bound olefin (olefins bound to 
later transition metals are attacked by nucleophiles) as 
a metal-carbon bond forms at the other end, to give a 
metallocyclobutane complex, 22 (a 14-electron com- 
plex). It loses a b-hydrogen atom to give (most likely) 
an rl- or v3-allyl hydride complex which reductively 
eliminates a new olefin.33 (“&Hydride elimination” is 
a common form of decomposition of metal alkyl 
complexes which contain one or more @-hydrogen 
atoms 
on the alkyl ligand(s).,). One olefin product predom- 
inates (90-9570) starting with 4, but mixtures con- 
taining two or more possibilities are found starting with 
other alkylidene complexes such as 6.15b 
The most surprising aspect of this reaction is that, 
although metallocyclobutane complexes are postulated 
intermediates in olefin metathe~is,~ 
the metathesis 
product (Me3CCH=CD2 from 22) is not found. An- 
other possible product, a cyclopropane, also is not. 
Perhaps they would be if the P-elimination step in the 
metallocycle intermediate could be slowed down, for 
example, if the intermediate were an 18-electron species. 
This is possible starting with a member of the 
MCp2(CHR)X 
class, but these either decompose first 
(when R = H, see below) or are quite unreactive toward 
ordinary olefins, probably because the olefin cannot 
easily coordinate to the metal. 
Acetylenes, like nitriles, “insert” into the M=CHR 
bond.lja The new ligand, a secondary alkylidene, must 
form by rearrangement of an intermediate metallo- 
cyclobutene complex (e.g., 4 - 
23; one C=C isomer, 
eq 9). Further reaction of 23 with PhCECPh is slow

In each bis(neopenty1idene) complex the two alkyl- 
idenes are nonequivalent in the ground-state structure 
and the PMe3 
ligands equivalent. Therefore the two 
alkylidene ligands must lie in the same plane (in 24 and 
25 at least) and must point in the same direction.36 In 
all three complexes the two neopentylidene ligands 
equilibrate at a rate which is on the order of the NMR 
time scale. Rotation about their M=C bonds is the 
most reasonable explanation. 
Bis(alky1idene) complexes37 
are of theoretical as well 
as practical importance. One intriguing question is why 
26 (for example) is not an olefin complex? The answer 
may be that Ta is so electron-poor it prefers the 16 
valence electrons in 26 compared to the 14 valence 
electrons in the olefin complex. In that case (if in- 
termolecular decomposition pathways can be prevented; 
see next section) even a bis(methy1ene) complex might 
be preparable. Perhaps the most interesting result, 
however, would be that as the size of the R substituent 
on =CHR decreases the olefin complex does form. To 
form a bis(alky1idene) complex from an olefin would

Bimolecular decomposition to give the olefin formed 
by coupling two alkylidene ligands38 
becomes less likely 
if the methylene ligand is substituted by a phenyl or 
tert-butyl group. Intramolecular a-hydrogen transfer 
pathways therefore become more important. Two 
possible products, alkylidyne complexes (or dimers 
thereof40) 
and bis(alky1idene) complexes, have already 
been mentioned. 
As the coordination sphere becomes less crowded 
and/or ligands (e.g., tertiary phosphines) become labile, 
intermolecular reactions of ~1 related, but more complex, 
nature than the intramolecular ones would seem more 
likely. A relatively simple example is shown in eq 14. 
However, redox processes also would now be more likely 
and could lead to considerably more complex results. 
Rearrangement of an alkylidene ligand which has a 
P-hydrogen atom to an olefin would seem a likely de- 
composition path since this is a well-known type of 
rearrangement of free ~arbenes.~

the l&electron complex may not be a prerequisite for 
rearrangement. The reverse (olefin - 
alkylidene) is an 
intriguing method of generatin the “first carbene” in 
An obvious 
minimum requirement for stability is that 
the alkylidene ligand should not attack another ligand 
in the complex. For example, PR3 ligands are com- 
patible with nucleophilic alkylidene ligands in these 
species (TaCp2(CHCMe3)C1 + PMe3 - 
TaCp2- 
(CHCMe3)(PMe3)+C1-) but CO is not (TaCp2- 
(CHCMe3)C1 
+ CO - 
TaCp2(0=C=CHCMe3)C1).l4 
The reverse is true for electrophilic alkylidene ligands.% 
Therefore one might expect to find many more Nb and 
Ta alkylidene complexes containing tertiary phosphine 
ligands in the future. 
a-Hydrogen Abstraction from Alkyl Ligands 
Let us 
now turn to the question of how and why these 
Nb and Ta alkylidene complexes form. 
The steric and electronic effects which set up H, to 
be abstracted from C, in electron-deficient neo- 
pentylidene and benzylidene complexes almost certainly 
operate to some extent in the corresponding elec- 
tron-deficient alkyl complexes which are their pre- 
cursors. Since the M-C,-C, 
angle will naturally be 
less than the M=C,-Cp 
angle (formally sp3 
vs. sp2 
C,) 
the steric effect may be more important than the 
electronic effect. It alone could be sufficient since 
neopentyl a-protons are anomalously acidic even in 
neopentylphosphonium salts42 where the “steric 
a~sistance”~~ 
is slight and evidently undetectable in the 
form of low values for JCH, 
in either phosphonium salts 
or the corresponding y l i d e ~ . ~ ~  
We should note, how- 
ever, that M-C,-Cp angles in many bulky alkyl com- 
plexes of the early transition metals are abnormally 
large3 (e.g., 128’ in Ta(CH2CMe3)3[C(CMe3)(Li. 
d m ~ ) ] ~ ~ ~ )  
and ‘JCH 
is often small (e.g., 105 Hz in the 
axial CH2CMe3 figand in Ta(CH2CMe3)4C112b). 
Whether the latter is due only to a steric effect or 
whether the electrophilic metal i
s

;
 
in the alkyl ligand is an intriguing question. It seems 
plausible that in a Nb or Ta alkyl complex an a-hy- 
drogen atom is drawn toward a “semibridging” position 
from which it can be more readily removed as a 
“proton” by another alkyl ligand. This viewpoint is 
consistent with our findings as 
follows: (i) a Abstraction 
from a CH2R ligand will be much more likely in the 
order R = CMe3 > Ph >
>
 H (as yet unobserved). The 
M-C,-R 
angle is going to be largest when R = CMe3 
and H, consequently will be pushed and pulled most 
toward the position where it can be removed by another 
alkyl. (ii) Since a larger M-C,-Cp angle increases the 
likelihood that an a-hydrogen will be removed, a ab- 
straction would seem more likely in a crowded coor- 
dination sphere where the M-C,-C, 
angle is forced

open. A coordination number of five is probably the 
minimum which would ensure that the molecule is 
crowded. a Abstraction in six- or seven-coordinate 
species seems equally if not more likely. (It 
is at present 
uncertain whether the two alkyl ligands must be cis to 
one another.) (iii) a 
Abstraction would be more efficient 
if one alkyl (the “leaving group”) could be differentiated 
from the one from which an a hydrogen is removed. 
This is most obviously possible in a trigonal-bipy- 
ramidal species such as 
Ta(CH2CMe3)4C1 
(1)12b 
in which 
one neopentyl ligand must be 
Differentiation 
is also possible in six- or seven-coordinate, or even 
square-planar species, but seems less plausible in tet- 
rahedral species. (iv) Finally, any change in the ligands 
which increases the electrophilicity of the metal should 
increase the rate of a abstraction. [Note that a ab- 
straction is easier in bromides (Br is a poorer 7r donor 
than C1) .] Phosphines probably add electron density 
to the metal, but apparently what is gained by making 
the coordination sphere more crowded outweighs this 
adverse electronic effect. Although an intramolecular 
acid/base type reaction is a useful description of a 
abstraction in Nb(V) and Ta(V) alkyl complexes, it is 
only a formalism. In general it will not be possible to 
accurately describe H, as it reaches the transition state 
and forms a bond to the a-carbon atom of the alkyl 
“leaving group”. 
Are other metals electron-deficient enough to behave 
like Nb(V) and Ta(V)? Probably. It is already known 
that Mo and W neopentylidene and neopentylidyne 
complexes 
can be prepared by methods similar to those 
used to prepare Nb and Ta species.48 
Green has 
“trapped” the methylene hydride arising from 
“Cp2WCH3+”.49 Shapley has observed a methyl G 
methylene hydride equilibrium in an osmium cluster.50 
It has also been known for some time that metals in 
16-electron complexes will strongly interact with hy- 
drogen atoms on nearby carbons;51 in one instance a 
bridging H i  
was proposed51e 
based on a lJcH, coupling 
constant of 74 H z . ~ ~ ~  
Yet an exactly analogous a-ab- 
straction reaction may not be favorable in later tran- 
sition-metal complexes. Recent studies concerning 
neopentyl complexes of R u , ~ ~  
Rh,52 
and PP3 
indicate 
that they decompose by apparent y-hydrogen ab- 
straction to give 0,/3-dimethylmetallocyclobutane 
complexes.
