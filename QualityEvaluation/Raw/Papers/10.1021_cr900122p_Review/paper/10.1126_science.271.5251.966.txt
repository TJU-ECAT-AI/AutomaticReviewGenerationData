The catalytic cleavage under hydrogen of the C-H and C-C bonds of alkanes with 
conventional catalysts requires high temperatures. Room-temperature hydrogenolysis of 
simple alkanes is possible on a well-defined and well-characterized zirconium hydride 
supported on silica obtained by surface organometallic chemistry. The surface structure 
resulting from hydrogenolysis of (=SiO)Zr(Np), (Np, neopentyl) was determined from the 
extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and 'H and 2gSi solid-state nuclear 
magnetic resonance and infrared (IR) spectra. A mechanism for the formation of 
(=SiO),Zr-H and (=SiO),SiH, 
and the resulting low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes 
is proposed. 
The mechanism may have 
implications 
forthe catalytic formation of methane,

Reaction of ZrNp4 with the silanol 
groups of a Degussa Aerosil silica pretreated 
at 500°C leads to the surface complex ( S -  
O)ZrNp3 
( I ) ,  
which has been characterized 
previously by surface microanalysis and 13C 
cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nu- 
clear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS NMR) 
and infrared (IR) spectroscopy (2). Treat- 
ment of 1 
with H, at around 150°C leads to 
the formation of silica-supported zirconium 
hydride and silicon hydride (2) (3-5). W e  
have characterized these various surface 
species by extended x-ray absorption fine 
structure (EXAFS) and 'H and 19Si solid- 
state NMR and IR spectroscopy. 
Analysis of the Zr K-edge EXAFS of 1 
(6) (Fig. 1A and Table 1) gave a first 
cooordination sphere of one Ooatom 
at 1.96 
A and three C atoms at 2.22 A; despite the 
similarity of 0 
and C p h p e  shifts, attempts 
to fit an 0 
sheil at 2.22 A together with a C 
shell at 1.96 A or to fit two shells of 0-C 
resulted in significantly increased refinement 
(R) factors and unacceptable Debye-Waller 
factors fqr the two shells. A n  additional shell 
at 3.42 A could be tentatively assigned to a 
shell of approximately three nonbonding 
neopentyl C atoms, although the quality of 
the data almost certainly limits the precision 
of this distant shell. The Zr-0 distance is 
similar to those observed in the siloxyzir- 
conium copplexes (DME)ZrCl,(OSiPh,), 
[1.91(1) A] (7) and [(r15-CSHs)2Zr(e- 
OSiPh,O)], [1.974(2) and 1.983(2) A] 
(8) and is also comparable to the Zr-0 
bond lengths in the hydroxy complexes 
Cp*,Zr(OH), [1.975(8) and 1.9!2(7) 
A] (9) and Cp",Zr(OH)C1[1.950(2) A] (9), 
suggesting essentially a single-bond charac- 
ter in the surface complex (DME, dimeth- 
ylether; Ph, phenyl; Cp", pentamethylcy- 
clopentadienyl; the numbers in parenthe- 
ses after the lengths are the standard errors 
in the l?st digits). The Zr-C distance 
of 2.22 A is shorter than those observed 
in (r15-CjHj)2Zr(CH2SiMe3); 
(Me, meth- 
yl) [2.278(4) and 2.281(4) A] (I?), (q5- 
C5H5),Zr (CH,CMe,), [2.294(8) 
A] (101, 
and <r(CH2Ph)4 (2.23, 2.26, 2.28, and 
2.29 A )  (1 
1) 
but is still within the expect- 
ed range for a Zr-C bond (1 
2). Taking the 
EXAFS Zr-C and C-C distances as 2.22 
and 1.54 A, 
respectively, the Zr-C-C angle 
is calculated to be 130°, with an estimated 
error of 5' 
to 10'; this compares very 
favorably with the Zr-C-X angles in iq5- 
CjHj)2Zr(CH,XMe3)2 (9) of 133.8(2)" 
and 135.2(2)" (X = Si) and 142.7(5)" (X 
= C ) .  The EXAFS results thus strongly 
support the presence of discrete [Sil-0- 
ZrNp, surface species. 
Treatment of (=Si-O)ZrNp, with H 2  
at 
150°C resulted in a significant change in 
the Zr K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 1B). This is in 
agreement with previous in situ IR and 
NMR experiments, which indicated the 
formation of a zirconium hydride species 
( 2 )  [zirconium-hydride stretching absor- 
bance v(Zr-H) band at 1635 cm-' and 'H

MAS NMR peak at chemical shift 6 = 10 
parts per million (ppm) (3, 13)]. By reac- 
tion with various halogenated compounds 
(such as CH31 and C2HjBr), 
it was found 
that there is an average of one hydride 
ligand per Zr (3). Analysis of the EXAFS 
data revealed a first coordination sphere of 
three 0 atoms at 1.94 A, consistent with 
single-bond formation. However, the R 
factor could be decrzased by 15% if an 
additional 0 
at 2.61 A was included in the 
EXAFS fit, suggesting a possible longer 
range Zr interaction with a fourth surface 
0 .  
These results (EXAFS, IR, NMR, and 
chemical reactivity) allow us to propose 
the formulation (Si-O),Zr-H for the sup- 
ported zirconium hydride species. W e  sug- 
gest a plausible mechanism for its forma- 
tion (Scheme l )  
based on the observation 
of two IR bands at 2253 and 2195 cm-', 
which were attributed to the presence of 
surface silanes. In addition, the IR data 
indicate that these surface silanes corre- 
spond to a silicon dihydride species (1 
4 ) ,  
T h e  formation of =SiH, means that two 
Si-0 bonds of the same Si atom have been 
broken. The presence of surface silanes has 
also been indicated by solid-state NMR 
(13). 
The simultaneous formation of =SiH2 
and (=Si-O),Zr-H species from the (=Si- 
O)ZrNp3 complex demonstrates that the 
hydrogenolysis of a sterically hindered 
(=Si-O)ZrNp, 
surface fragment results in 
the opening of the very strong Si-0-Si 
bonds. T o  understand this phenomenon, we 
must consider a system such as the one 
depicted in Scheme 1: The postulated ZrH3 
intermediate resulting from the hydro- 
genolysis of the three neopentyl groups of 
(=Si-O)ZrNp3 is bonded to a S i 0 4  tetra- 
hedron. W e  assume that two Si-0-Si bridg- 
es of this tetrahedron will be broken, with 
coordination of the 0 
to the Zr and of the 
hydride to the Si, in agreement with the 
above results. Zirconium is more oxophilic 
than Si and has a similar bonding enthalpy 
for the M-H bond (M = Zr or Si); there- 
fore, this is a realistic hypothesis. The dis- 
tance from the 0 atoTs to the Zr atom is 
not very large (-2.4 A by molecular me- 
chanics), and so the reaction (Scheme 1) 
2 
Scheme 1. The Zr, 0-1, 
Si-1, 0-4, and Si-2 at- 
oms are shown in the same plane. The atoms 0-2 
and 0-3 are symmetrical with respect to this 
plane.

should proceed relatively easily. In this 
model, the =SiH2 entity is "protected" by 
the zirconium hydride, probably inducing 
the long relaxation rates experimentally ob- 
served in 29Si NMR (13). Also, the 0 - 4  
aJom is not very far from the Zr atom (-2.9 
A by molecular mechanics without optimi- 
zation of the structure); it is probably this 0 
that lea+ to the EXAFS coordination shell 
at 2.61 A. This distance could result from a 
slight distortion of the SiH202 
tetrahedron 
(IR data indicate that the H-Si-H angle is 
-95'; 
the 0 - S i - 0  angle probably increases 
compared with its normal value of 109"). 
These results show that reaction of the 
well-defined (Si-O)ZrNp3 complex (where 
the Zr atom is tetracoordinated) leads to the 
formation of a zirconium monohydride spe- 
cies, (%-O),-ZrH, 
and a silicon dihydride 
species, =SiH,. The resulting structure is ex- 
ceptional and can be interpreted to explain 
the catalytic process of hydrogenolysis. In this 
structure, the zirconium hydride has an eight- 
electron configuraiion (10 if one considers 
the 0 - 4  at 2.64 A). Molecular ZrlIV) hu-

drides are generally stabilized by two cyclo- 
pentadienyl ligands. They are thus 16-elec- 
tron species and therefore less electrophilic 
than 2. The immobilization of the hydride on 
a surface apparently prevents dimeriiation, 
which would normally occur for truly molec- 
ular species. 
W e  are proposing a mechanism by 
which the catalyst operates on a "supramo- 
lecular" basis, that is, by including both the 
surface structure of the catalyst and the 
alkanes. The mechanism is based on pre- 
liminary results concerning the elementarv 
steps of C-H bond activation with such a 
catalyst (3, 4), as well as some elementary 
steps of P-alkyl transfer that are known to 
occur when an alkyl group or chain is 
linked to an earlv transition metal 115). In 
~, 
the particular case of neopentane hydro- 
genolysis, the mechanism involves the for- 
mation of a Zr-CH,C(CH,), 
species by 
o-bond metathesis, followed by P-methyl 
transfer to give isobutylene and a Zr-CH3 
species. The latter is converted to methane 
by H,, with regeneration of the Zr-H cata- 
lyst. 
The primary product isobutylene was 
not identified, probably because the catalyst 
rapidly converted it to isobutane under H 
2' 
Isobutane undergoes further hydrogenolysis 
to propane and methane; propane is hy- 
drogenolyzed to ethane and methane. 
Ethane is not cleaved, presumably because 
the ethylzirconium intermediate lacks a 
P-methyl group. 
This mechanism, which occurs at room 
temperature, is quite similar to that de- 
scribed by Mango et al. ( I ) ,  which was 
proposed to explain the methane formation 
in natural gas. Our results support strongly 
the assumption that methane in natural gas 
could be the result of a catalytic process 
under mild conditions; high temperature 
may not be a requirement for the forma- 
tion of natural gas. It is quite possible that 
under hydrogen [its average concentration 
in natural gas is -700 ppm and in some 
cases can reach 50% (I)], sedimentary 
rocks containing transition metals such as 
Zr or T i  may contain a small amount of 
surface hydride that is able to cleave cat- 
alytically the C-H and C-C bonds of al- 
kanes or alkenes.

Source 
at the Daresbury Laboratory 
(2 
GeV; 
average current, 
-180 mA) with a Si(220) order-sorting monochro- 
mator. Samples for EXAFS analysis were prepared 
and handled under the strict exclusion of air. XAS 
cells with Teflon-coated Kapton windows were 
blown onto break-seal Pyrex tubes containing the 
silica-supported Zr samples and evacuated to about 
0.01 Pa before sample transfer. Spectra were ac- 
quired at room temperature in fluorescence mode 
with a Canberra 13-element solid-state detector. 
Background-subtracted EXAFS data were obtained 
with the program PAXAS (16). 
A polynom~al 
of order

and the post-edge background was subtracted by 
f~tting 
this region wth coupled polynomials 
of order 7

calculated from relativ~st~c 
Hartee-Fock self-con-

The k3-weighted parameters are presented in Ta-

Also, the Si and H atoms had

 relaxation rates (up to 30 s for protons, 
and more than 200 s for S atoms). 
We recorded 2gSi 
CP-MAS NMR spectra after the ntroducton of O 
and water on the sample. Peaks corresponding to 
the Si(OSi),,(OH), 
(n = 0, 1, 2) entities were ob- 
served, together w~th 
a broad signal near -70 ppm 
attributed to Si directly bonded to H. Unfortunateiy, 
this does not allow unambiguous differentiation be- 
tween the =SiH and =SiH, because the '% NMR 
resonances for these species span the same range 
(-40 to -80 ppm) [F. C. Schlilng, T. W. Weidman,

ably the result of an exchange reaction of the

R frequencies are expected at h = 1/2(B + A'"), 
with B = 2f((1*, + a), 
A = 4 ( ( I * ~ ,

The 
corresponding frequenc~es 
are 2223 and 1597

7 
cm-l agrees with the first, but the latter frequency 
is masked by the two SD, bands at 1638 and 1583 
cm-'. An H-SI-H 
angle of 95 -t 5" was estimated 
from the intensity ratio of the two R bands, assum- 
ing that their respective intensties were proportion- 
al to the variaton of the dipolar momentum.

Lamellar Biogels: Fluid-Membrane-Based 
Hydrogels Containing Polymer Lipids 
Heidi E. Warriner, Stefan H. J. Idziak, Nelle L. Slack, 
Patrick Davidson,* Cyrus R. Safinyat 
A class of lamellar biological hydrogels comprised of fluid membranes of lipids and 
surfactants with small amounts of low molecular weight poly(ethy1ene glycol)-derived 
polymer lipids (PEG-lipids) 
were studied by x-ray diffraction, polarized light microscopy, 
and rheometry. In contrast to isotropic hydrogels of polymer networks, 
these membrane- 
based birefringent liquid crystalline biogels, labeled L-,,, form the gel phase when water 
is added to the liquid-like lamellar L
,
 phase, which reenters a liquid-like mixed phase upon 
further dilution. Furthermore, gels with larger water content require less PEG-lipid to 
remain stable. Although concentrated (-50 weight percent) mixtures of free PEG (mo- 
lecular weight, 5000) and water do not gel, gelation does occur in mixtures containing as 
little as 0.5 weight percent PEG-lipid. A defining signature of the La,, regime as it sets in 
from the fluid lamellar La phase is 
the proliferation of layer-dislocation-type defects, which 
are stabilized by the segregation of PEG-lipids to the defect regions of high membrane 
curvature that connect the membranes. 
G e l s  
are viscoelastic materials that normal- 
ly consist of a solid component dispersed in 
a liquid, water in the case of hydrogels. 
Polymer gels (I)-either 
natural, such as 
gelatin, or synthetic-contain 
a polymer 
network (2), 
which serves as the solid com- 
ponent and can resist shear. For many bio- 
logical applications, gels based on high mo- 
lecular weight poly(ethy1ene oxide) [PEO, 
(OCH,CH,),,I (3) have been used because 
of their low immunogenicity: the material 
can be used to coat more immunogenic 
tissues (I 
) and materials (4). 
Recent studies show that attaching low 
molecular weight (n < 150) PEO (referred 
to as PEG) to a biological macromolecule 
15-81 can dramaticallv increase blood cir- 
culation times. Both ieptides and proteins 
can be protected by covalently attached 
PEG for in vivo administration of therapeu- 
tic enzymes (5), and so-called "Stealth" 
liposomes (6-8) consisting of closed bilayer 
shells of phospholipids covered with PEG- 
lipids hydrophobically anchored to the 
membrane can be used as a drug carrier 
system. The inhibition of the body's im-

mune response to these PEG-coated lipo- 
somes has been attributed (8) to a polymer- 
brush-type 
steric repulsion (9) that has 
been measured between PEG-coated mem- 
branes incorworated both in the chain-fro- 
Zen membrane phase on a solid substrate 
(10) and in the chain-melted fluid phase in 
multilamellar L, systems (1 
1). In these sys- 
tems, the emphasis was in the regime where 
the intermembrane distance d I 
R,, where 
R, is the PEG radius of gyration. 
In exploring the interactions between 
PEG-lipid and the chain-melted fluid phase 
in multilarnellar L
,
 systems, we have dis- 
covered a lamellar hydrogel phase, labeled 
L,,,, in the high water regime of the phase 
diaeram. This eel incorvorates n o  solid 
- 
- 
phase component. Polarized light microsco- 
py has revealed that this phase is not iso- 
trovic and shows liauid crvstal-like birefrin- 
geI;ce. Studies witi x-ra): diffraction show 
that the maximum interlayer spacings d >
>
 
R, for this phase (Fig. 1A); 
a model for the 
structure of this phase suggests that PEG- 
h i d  stabilizes laver dislocation defects in 
regions of high membrane curvature (Fig. 
1B). Unlike Lp, gels that incorporate solid 
membranes (12), a bioactive gel based o n  
fluid membranes could incorporate mem- 
brane-embedded vroteins that are bioloei- 
- 
tally active, thus providing a way in which 
to deliver such molecules in a stable gel. A n  
unusual feature of these gels is that they can 
be formed from a liquid-like flowing L, 
phase by adding water and also dissolved 
back to a flowing two-phase liquid by fur- 
ther addition of water. 
The L,,, 
phase is composed of mem- 
branes of DMPC (dimyristoyl phosphatidyl 
choline), the co-surfactant pentanol, and 
small amounts of the polymer-lipid PEG- 
DMPE {1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoeth- 
anolamine-N-[poly(ethylene 
glycol)]} sepa- 
rated by water. The PEG-lipid is hydropho- 
bically anchored but free to diffuse within 
the fluid membrane (Fig. 1A). W e  investi- 
gated two different molecular weights of 
PEG, 2053 g/mol (PEG2000; n = 45 mono- 
mers) and 5181 g/mol (PEG5000; n = 113) 
(Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama). 
The most dilute gels contained 90.0 weight 
% water, 6.0 weight % lipid, 3.46 weight % 
pentanol, and 0.54 weight % PEG5000- 
DMPE (Fig. 2). In contrast, the convention- 
al solid-membrane Lp. gels incorporate at 
most 40 weight % water (12). In principle, 
addition of PEG-lipid to even more dilute L- 
phases 1-99 weight % (13)] 
would result in 
extremely dilute lamellar gels.
