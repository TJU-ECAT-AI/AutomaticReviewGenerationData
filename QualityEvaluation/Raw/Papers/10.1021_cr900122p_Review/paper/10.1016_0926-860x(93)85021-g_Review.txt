Oxidative hydroxylation using dinitrogen monoxide: a possible route for organic synthesis over zeolites
Abstract
The use of zeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions has been considered. Particular attention has been paid to recent studies of a gas-phase oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics by dinitrogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25â€“30% benzene conversion. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide new efficient technologies in organic synthesis. Peculiarities of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant and the reaction mechanism are discussed.
