1. Introduction
Catalytic oxidation is a key technology for converting petroleum-based feedstocks to useful chemicals of a high oxidation state such as alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and epoxides. Millions of tons of these compounds are annually produced worldwide and find applications in all areas of chemical industries, ranging from pharmaceutical to large-scale commodities. 1 For economic and environmental reasons, the oxidation processes of bulk chemical industries predominantly involve the use of molecular oxygen as the primary oxidant. Their success depends largely on the use of metal catalysts to promote both the rate of reaction and the selectivity to partial oxidation products. The production of ethylene oxide from ethylene with molecular oxygen catalyzed by silver salts, 2 that of terephthalic acid from p-xylene using molecular oxygen in the presence of manganese and cobalt salts, 3 and the Wacker oxidation of alkenes to carbonyl compounds catalyzed by palladium salts1k are examples of successful commercial processes.
During recent years, in the wake of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, attention has also been focused on the development of catalytic oxidations for the manufacture of fine chemicals. The traditional methods of many fine chemical oxidations involve stoichiometric quantities of toxic inorganic reagents such as permanganate and dichromate. These reactions generate large amounts of inorganic salt-containing effluent along with the target products. Thus, currently there is considerable pressure to replace these antiquated technologies with cleaner, catalytic alternatives. A clean synthetic technology that should proceed with a high atom economy and the overall synthesis must be accomplished with a low E-factor, thereby minimizing the cost of waste disposal.1f The ideal system for “green” oxidation is the use of molecular oxygen as the primary oxidant together with recyclable catalysts in nontoxic solvents or supercritical CO2.1e Thus, the current goal of the research and industry is the development of effective metal catalysts that can activate the molecular oxygen at ambient conditions and transfer to fine chemical substrates with high stereoselectivity.
The aerobic catalytic oxidations, irrespective of heterogeneous or homogeneous process, can be classified into four categories as described below:
(i) Oxidation Based on the Model of Monooxygenase. These oxidations are modeled on the natural monooxygenase and require coreductants such as RCHO, ROH, and PPh3 (Scheme 1).4a-e
Scheme 1
(ii) Free Radical Oxidation. These oxidations are generally carried out without any external coreductant and more closely resemble autoxidation than monooxygenase-catalyzed systems (Scheme 2).5
Scheme 2
(iii) Oxidation of a Coordinated Substrate by a Metal Ion. In this oxidation, the oxidized form of the metal is subsequently regenerated by reaction of the reduced form with molecular oxygen (Scheme 3).1k,6,7e
Scheme 3
(iv) Oxidation Mimicking Dioxygenase. In this reaction both oxygen atoms of the activated molecular oxygen coordinated to the transition metal complex are incorporated into the substrate (Scheme 4).4f
Scheme 4
This review covers the recent advances of the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes, oxidation of alkenes to alcohols and ketones, Wacker oxidation, allylic oxidation, C−H oxidation, Baeyer−Villiger oxidation, and sulfoxidation reactions. The aerobic oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds is not covered in this contribution because it has been very recently reviewed.6 Thus, section 2 is devoted to epoxidation, whereas section 3 presents the oxidation of alkenes to alcohols and ketones. Wacker oxidation and allylic oxidation of alkenes are discussed in sections 4 and 5, respectively, whereas sections 6 and 7 give a survey of the oxidative dehydrogenation and oxygenation of alkanes. Benzylic oxidation, aromatic C−H oxidation, Baeyer−Villiger oxidation, and sulfoxidation reactions are covered in sections 8−11, respectively. All of the processes that use transition metal complexes as the catalysts with molecular oxygen have been considered.
Several books and review articles have appeared, which are wholly or partly devoted to the metal-catalyzed aerobic oxidations.7 Reviews and books devoted to more narrow topics will be cited later. Consequently, the present paper emphasizes the works published during the past 10−15 years. Due to a vast literature, the reviews are cited rather than original publications in some cases. This review covers studies up to September 2004.
2. Epoxidation
Epoxides are important synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of oxygen-containing natural and unnatural compounds.7f,8 Access to a variety of epoxides has largely been successful due to the remarkable catalytic activity of transition metal complexes, which have a unique ability to bring the alkene substrate and the oxygen source within the coordination sphere of the metal leaving to a facial transfer of oxygen atom to the carbon−carbon double bond. This section describes the role of various transition metal complexes used during the epoxidation with molecular oxygen.
2.1. Titanium Catalysts
Silica-supported titanium catalysts are investigated for the epoxidation of propene with molecular oxygen at 200−300 °C.9 The catalyst having titanium-modified silica zeolite with an Si/Al ratio of 1900 is found to be the most effective, affording propene oxide in 20.4% yield at 300 °C.9d It is expected that fine control of acid properties of the supports and titanium content may enhance the catalyst performance for propene oxide formation.
2.2. Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
These catalysts have been studied for the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes in the presence as well as absence of coreductants.
2.2.1. Reactions without Coreductants
Vanadium- and molybdenum-based catalysts have been widely used for the epoxidation of alkenes with hydroperoxides.10a Consequently, the development of an epoxidation system using a hydroperoxide generated in situ by autoxidation is attractive from the synthetic and industrial point of view. Thus, the epoxidation of a variety of alkenes has been described by the combined use of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), Co(OAc)2, Mo(CO)6, and ethylbenzene in the presence of molecular oxygen (Table 1).10b This reaction involves autoxidation of ethylbenzene assisted by NHPI and the subsequent epoxidation of alkenes with the resulting hydroperoxide catalyzed by Mo(CO)6 (Scheme 5). Similarly, the Keggin-type polyoxometalates, PTMM11O39 4- (TM = MnII, CoII, or RuIII and M = MoVI or WVI), have been shown to catalyze the autoxidation of cumene to cumylhydroperoxide with molecular oxygen that transfers one oxygen atom to 1-octene to provide the corresponding epoxide in high turnover number (TON),10c whereas the vanadium and molybdenum complexes 1−3 have been used for the epoxidation of cyclohexene, 1-octene, and styrene, respectively (Schemes 6 and 7).10d-f These reactions operate with moderate selectivity in the presence of molecular oxygen at 50−100 °C. The catalyst 3 has been encapsulated on zeolite (NaY) to afford 3−NaT, which catalyzes the epoxidation of styrene with high yield (Scheme 8).10f The catalytic activity and selectivity of 3−NaY is significantly higher than that of its homogeneous analogue 3.

2.2.2. Reactions Involving Coreductants
Vanadium-based catalysts have been used for the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of coreductants. Mukaiyama and co-workers reported the epoxidation of norbornene derivatives using vanadium complex 4 and molecular oxygen in the presence of 2-propanol (Scheme 9).11 Addition of molecular sieves (4 Å) is essential to this reaction, as in their absence the catalyst 4 becomes less active, leading to a low yield of the epoxide. The polyoxometalate, NPV6Mo6, catalyzes the epoxidation of a variety of alkenes including homoallylic alcohols in the presence of aldehydes at ambient conditions (Scheme 10).12 Aliphatic aldehydes bearing di- or trialkyl groups on the α-position of the carbonyl carbon are found to be effective for this system.

Scheme 10
2.3. Manganese Catalysts
Manganese complexes catalyze the epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes with molecular oxygen. Most of these reactions function in the presence of coreductants.
2.3.1. Reactions with Achiral Catalysts
Mukaiyama and co-workers reported the epoxidation of cholesteryl derivatives using Mn(dpm)2 (dpm = dipivaloylmethanato) in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen (Scheme 11).13a This result is of particular interest because the stereoselectivity of the cholesteryl epoxide is opposite (β-epoxide) to that observed using a peracid (α-epoxide) such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid.13b The reverse stereoselectivity suggests that the epoxidation with Mn(dpm)2 is not a process involving a simple carboxylic peracid generated from the aldehyde by autoxidation; rather, an oxygenated metal complex is the reactive intermediate.
Scheme 11
The epoxidation of a variety of unfunctionalized alkenes has been subsequently performed using manganese catalysts in the presence of coreductants. Manganese porphyrin complexes,14 Mn(OAc)215, and complex 516 have been employed for the epoxidation of a wide range of alkenes in the presence of aldehydes and molecular oxygen. Investigation of 5 reveals that it exists as a monomer and does not undergo dimerization through the formation of a μ-oxobridge17a or oxidative degradation via the formation of a multinuclear μ-oxo complex17b during the reaction processes due to steric hindrance.17c Nolte and Gosling reported a two-phase system utilizing MnTPPCl 6 (TPP = 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato) and [Rh(III)bipyCp*Cl]Cl (bipy = 2,2‘-bipyridine; Cp* = η 5-C5Me5) with sodium formate for the reductive activation of molecular oxygen and the subsequent epoxidation of alkenes.18 The reducing equivalents for the conversion of MnIII to MnII are obtained from the rhodium-catalyzed oxidation of formate to CO2 (Scheme 12). The complex 6 has also been used for the epoxidation of cyclohexene in the presence of zinc powder as a reductant and benzoic anhydride as a cleaving agent of the molecular oxygen.19
Scheme 12
Few studies have focused on the use of solid supported and polynuclear manganese catalysts. Manganese aluminophosphates, MnAlPO-5, MnAlPO-18, and MnAlPO-36, have been shown to catalyze the production of acylperoxy radicals from benzaldehyde; these, in turn, in dry air (30 atm) convert cyclohexene, styrene, α-pinene, (+)-limonene, and 1-hexene to a mixture of epoxides and diols in high yields (Table 2).21 Other aldehydes can be used as sacrificial oxidants for this system provided they are small enough to gain access to the active sites situated at the inner surface of the molecular sieve catalyst. Importantly, the manganese ions are not leached out during the use. The polymeric manganese Schiff base 8 has been subsequently used for the epoxidation of cyclohexene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, styrene, and cyclooctene in the presence of 2-methylpropanal at ambient conditions,22 whereas the protocol employing zeolite−NaY-encapsulated Mn−Schiff base complex 7 catalyzes the epoxidation of 1-octene and 1-decene in 26−63% conversion (74−75% selectivity) under oxygen atmosphere.20 This is the first example in the manganese-catalyzed aerobic epoxidation of alkenes that functions without a coreductant.

2.3.2. Enantioselective Reactions
The enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes is a highly successful reaction using chiral Mn−salen complexes 9 in the presence of α-branched aliphatic aldehydes23a-e and β-ketoesters23f (Scheme 13). Addition of N-alkylimidazole (NAI) is essential in these reactions as its absence leads to low chemical and optical yield of an epoxide having the opposite enantioselectivity (Scheme 14). Additives of such kind are supposed to act as additional ligands in the axial position to the metal center. These reactions are also found to be effective in a fluorous biphase system (FBS), and up to 92% ee is reported in the epoxidation of indene using complex 10a (Scheme 15).23d The FBS needs a substantially lower amount of the catalyst compared with those required under homogeneous conditions (catalyst 1.5% with respect to the alkene, instead of 12%) and the fluorocarbon layer can be recycled for the second run without appreciable decrease of activity. The chiral sulfonato-Mn−salen 10b intercalated into a Zn−Al layered double hydroxide is recyclable and catalyzes the epoxidation of (R)-(+)-limonene with 90.7% selectivity and 54% diastereomeric excess.23e
Scheme 13
Scheme 14
Scheme 15
To rationalize these results different active species are proposed as shown in Scheme 16. In the presence of NAI, the acylperoxomanganese complex 11 is transformed to the oxomanganese complex 12, an intermediate that is in accordance with the one proposed in the Jacobsen−Katsuki epoxidation which leads to the (1S,2R)-enantiomer of the epoxide.24a-c However, in the absence of NAI, 11 leads to the formation of the (1R,2S)-epoxide.24d
Scheme 16
Changing the ligand structure from salen to optically active β-ketoimine-type ligands afforded 13, which catalyzes more efficiently the epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene, conjugated dienes, and enynes in high enantioselectivity (up to 87% ee) in the presence of pivalaldehyde and molecular oxygen in benzene (Scheme 17).25 The enantioface selection is opposite from those obtained by using terminal oxidants such as NaOCl and PhIO. Thus, the formation of an acylperoxomanganese complex such as 11 from 13 is proposed for this system.
Scheme 17
2.4. Iron Catalysts
Iron complexes are considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for oxygenation, because iron is an inexpensive and less hazardous metal compared with other transition metals. Therefore, much research work has been conducted for iron complex catalyzed epoxidation of alkenes with various oxidants:  PhIO,26a NaOCl,26b perbenzoate,26c and molecular oxygen.26d,e During recent years, Fe(dmp)3 [dmp = 1,3-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-propanedionato],27 Fe(AAEMA)3 [AAEMA = 2-(acetoacetoxy)ethyl methacrylate],28 and iron(III) oxamato complex2914 have been investigated for the epoxidation of a variety of cyclic and linear alkenes in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen. By this method, olefinic alcohols can be converted to the corresponding epoxy alcohols in quantitative yield (Scheme 18).
Scheme 18
Hennig and co-workers studied the photocatalytic oxidation of cycloalkenes with molecular oxygen and iron(III) porphyrin complexes.30 Alkenes with strained carbon−carbon double bonds give preferentially epoxides, whereas mainly allylic oxidation is observed for unstrained alkenes. Enantioselective photooxygenation of racemic α-pinene is investigated using the cyclodextrin-linked iron−porphyrin complex 15 in the presence of 2-methylpyridine in benzene to afford a mixture of epoxides (41% ee), allylic alcohols (49−67% ee), and enones (5−23% ee). In this reaction, 2-methylpyridine is believed to make axial complexation with the metal center at the unprotected side of the porphyrin, lowering the participation of oxygenation reactions by the “achiral site” of 15.
2.5. Ruthenium Catalysts
Ruthenium-catalyzed epoxidation has been carried out by a wide variety of ligands. Most of these oxidations proceed via a labile ruthenium oxo species, which transfers the oxygen atom to the organic substrates.
2.5.1. Reactions without Coreductants
The use of oxoruthenium complexes as the catalysts for the oxidation of organic substrates has been the subject of intense study in recent years.31 A ruthenium complex, Ru(TMP)O217a (TMP = tetramesitylporphyrinato), prepared by m-CPBA oxidation of the corresponding carbonyl−Ru(II) complex, Ru(TMP)CO 16a, is used by several groups for the epoxidation of wide range of alkenes with up to 40 TON in the presence of molecular oxygen.32 Che and co-workers described that the chiral ruthenium complex 17b catalyzes the oxidation of styrene derivatives and 1,2-dihydronaphthalene to epoxides 18−21 (up to 73% ee) under 8 atm of molecular oxygen.33 This is the first example of the aerobic enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes that does not rely on the use of a coreductant. Neumann and Dahan reported that the ruthenium-based polyoxometalate, [WZnRuIII2(ZnW9O34)2],11- catalyzes the epoxidation of a wide range of alkenes with up to 120 TON under molecular oxygen.34
2.5.2. Reactions Involving Coreductants
Ruthenium complexes have been shown to catalyze efficiently the epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of 2-methylpropanal at ambient conditions. 35-37 Thus, the epoxidation of a variety of cyclic alkenes has been carried out using catalysts 22 and 23 in high yields (Scheme 19).35a,b Steroids are mainly converted to the corresponding β-epoxides 24a−c.35a Knochel and Ragagnin reported that RuCl3−pyridine−benzimidazole catalyzes the epoxidation of alkenes including steroids in a fluorous biphase system (FBS).35c The fluorous phase containing the catalyst can be recycled without loss of activity. The chiral ruthenium complexes, (S,S)-ruthenium(II) bisoxazole3625 and [brucine](R)-Ru(III)(PDTA-H)Cl]37 (PDTA = propylene-1,2-diaminotetraacetic acid) 26, have been used for the epoxidation of styrene derivatives, where 26 is found to be efficient in providing the epoxides with up to 57% ee (Table 3).37 These preliminary results suggest that chiral ruthenium complexes may lead to effective catalytic systems for the enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes.

2.6. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt-catalyzed epoxidation of alkenes with molecular oxygen is extensively investigated. Most of these reactions have been performed in the presence of coreductants such as aldehydes, acetals, and β-ketoesters. Cobalt(II) complexes containing β-diketone ligands with electron-donating substituents have been shown to catalyze the epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of diethyl acetal 38 and 2-methylpropanal. 39 Because the protocol involving diethyl acetal functions under neutral conditions, epoxidation of acid sensitive alkenes can be performed (Scheme 20).38a Iqbal and co-workers studied the Schiff base complexes 27−29 for the epoxidation of alkenes including steroids and terpenoids in the presence of either aliphatic aldehyde or β-ketoester at ambient temperature (Scheme 21). 40 Journax and co-workers reported that square-planar cobalt(III) complexes 30 catalyze the epoxidation of alkenes in moderate to high yields in the presence of pivalaldehyde at ambient temperature. 41 Alkenes bearing hydroxy and ether groups are converted to the corresponding epoxides without undesirable decomposition of the functional groups (Scheme 22). Contrary to the case of analogous Collins complexes, 42 no epoxidation is observed with PhIO.
Scheme 20
Scheme 21
Scheme 22
There are few studies focusing on the use of polymer and solid supported cobalt catalysts for the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes in the presence of aldehydes. 43,44 Iqbal and co-workers employed the polyaniline-supported Co−salen 28 for the π-facial selective epoxidation of N-cinnamoyl amino acid derivatives in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen (Scheme 23).43 The peptides that are able to adopt a γ- or β-turn due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding provide high diastereoselectivity. Under similar conditions, the polybenzimidazole 32 supported Co(acac)244a and silica-supported cobalt−carboxylate44b33 catalyze the epoxidation of a variety of unfunctionalized alkenes with high yields (Table 4). Cobalt aluminophosphates (CoAlPO) have been shown to catalyze the epoxidation of cyclohexene, styrene, α-pinene, (+)-limonene, and 1-hexene in the presence of benzaldehyde and molecular oxygen (Table 2).21 The catalytic activity of CoAlPO is comparable with the corresponding MnAlPO in terms of the selectivity and yield of the epoxide. However, the reaction involving the zeolite (NaX) supported Co(OAc)2 catalyzes the epoxidation of styrene with 44.2% conversion and 60% selectivity under oxygen atmosphere. 45 This is the first example in the cobalt-catalyzed aerobic epoxidation of alkenes that does not involve a coreductant.

2.7. Iridium Catalysts
Takao and co-workers investigated the oxidation of styrene into a mixture of styrene epoxide, benzaldehyde, and acetophenone by Vaska's complex, IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2, in toluene at 110 °C. 46 Cyclohexene and 1-hexene have been oxidized into a mixture of the corresponding epoxides, enols, and enones in the presence of [Ir(CH3CN)4NO2](X)2 (X = PF6 or BF4) at 120 °C under 20 atm of molecular oxygen. 47
2.8. Nickel Catalysts
Nickel complexes have been widely studied for the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes. Mukaiyama and co-workers reported the epoxidation of a variety of alkenes using Ni(dmp)2 [dmp = 1,3-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-propanedionato] in the presence of 2-methylpropanal 48 and n-butanol 49 (Scheme 24). The reaction involving the alcohol needs an excess of the catalyst, oxygen pressure, and heating compared to the process of the aldehyde. Katsuki and co-workers described the epoxidation of linear alkenes using 34 in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen (Scheme 25). 50 The square planar nickel(II) complexes 31 have been shown to catalyze the epoxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene, indene, trans-stilbene, β-methylstyrene, and β-citronellol derivatives in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen, 51 whereas the chiral nickel complex 35 catalyzes the epoxidation of 1-octene, indene, 1-hexene, and tert-4-octene with 18−41% ee and 66−85% yield. 52
Scheme 24
Scheme 25
Polymer and solid supported nickel complexes have been studied for the epoxidation of a wide range of alkenes. The clay-impregnated nickel complex, Ni(acac)2-montmorillonite K10, is used for the epoxidation of a variety of alkenes in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and compressed air. 53 Under similar reaction conditions, the nickel carboxylate anchored on mesoporous silica 36 54 and the polybenzimidazole 32 supported Ni(acac)244a catalyze the epoxidation of cyclohexene, (S)-limonene, α-pinene, 1-octene, and styrene in high yields (Scheme 26). The polymer-bound complex 32−Ni(acac)2 can be recovered from the reaction mixture. However, some loss of activity is observed upon reuse of the catalyst, presumably due to leaching of the metal complex.
Scheme 26
2.9. Palladium Catalysts
Pd(OAc)2 is used for the epoxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes with molecular oxygen in the presence of azibenzil (Scheme 27). 55 Accordingly, the cyclic and terminal aliphatic alkenes are selectively epoxidized in moderate to good yields, and internal alkenes afford a mixture of cis and trans epoxides. However, in the case of aromatic alkenes, oxidative cleavage of the carbon−carbon double bond is reported.
Scheme 27
The epoxidation of propene catalyzed by Pd−Pt/TS-1 with in situ formed hydrogen peroxide from molecular oxygen and hydrogen is reported in a fixed bed reactor under high-pressure conditions.56a The initial propene oxide selectivity is very high (99%) at 3.5% conversion, but the catalyst deactivates rapidly with time-on-stream, and successively the formation of methyl formate becomes the prevalent reaction. Use of CO2, instead of N2, has a beneficial effect on the formation of propene oxide, and even higher yields are obtained when the pressure is increased from 49 to 118 atm (supercritical fluid phase). Alternatively, Pd(OAc)2 has been shown to catalyze the epoxidation of propene in 42.7% conversion and 81.6% selectivity in the presence of molecular oxygen. 56 This reaction operates in the presence of cocatalysts such as [(C6H13)4N]3{PO-[W(O)(O2)2]4},56b Ti-Al-MCM-22, and Ti-MCM-22.56c
2.10. Gold Catalysts
Gold has long been thought to be chemically inert; however, it has recently been proven that its catalytic performance is dramatically tunable by control of the particle size and by careful selection of the support metal oxide. A typical example is the selective oxidation of propene in a gas containing oxygen and hydrogen. 57,58 When gold is deposited (deposition−precipitation method) on TiO2, TiO2/SiO2, TS-1, TS-2, Ti-β, Ti-MCM-41, and Ti-MCM-48 as a highly dispersed nanosize hemispherical particle with a diameter of 2.0−4.0 nm, it produces propene oxide with selectivities >90% and conversions up to 9.8% at temperatures of 30−160 °C. The oxidation of hydrogen to form water is depressed by propene, whereas propene oxidation is not only enhanced but also restricted to partial oxidation by hydrogen. The reaction rate is almost independent of the concentration of propene and increases linearly with increasing concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen, and a hydroperoxide-like intermediate is proposed for this epoxidation (Scheme 28).
Scheme 28
Modification of the Au/TiO2/SiO2 catalysts with platinum is beneficial for both the activity and selectivity in the propene epoxidation. 59 The water−propene oxide ratio decreases upon the addition of platinum to the Au/TiO2/SiO2 catalyst, whereas the epoxidation activity is maintained. Hydrogenation of propene to unwanted propane does not occur at temperatures below 100 °C.
3. Alkenes to Alcohols and Ketones
Alcohols and ketones are important compounds in synthetic and industrial chemistry.7e Studies are focused on the preparation of these compounds from alkenes by an oxidation process using molecular oxygen (eq 1).
These reactions are different from the classical Wacker oxidation, as they do not involve any redox coreductants. This section covers the transition metal catalyzed oxidation of alkenes to alcohols and ketones with molecular oxygen.
3.1. Manganese Catalysts
The oxidation of unfunctionalized alkenes to the corresponding alcohols has been reported using manganese complex 6 and molecular oxygen in the presence of NaBH4 and [NBu4]BH4 (Scheme 29). 60 In these reactions the actual product is a ketone, which undergoes reduction in situ to an alcohol by an excess of borohydride. Mukaiyama and co-workers described the hydration of α,β-unsaturated esters to α-hydroxy esters using Mn(dpm)2 and molecular oxygen in the presence of phenylsilane in 2-propanol. 61 This reaction provides an effective route for the direct hydration of α,β-unsaturated esters (Scheme 30).
Scheme 29

3.2. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt(II) complexes have been studied for the oxidation of alkenes to alcohols and ketones with molecular oxygen. Drago and co-workers reported the oxidation of styrene and 1-hexene using Co(SMDPT) 37 [SMDPT = (3-(salicylidieneimino)propyl)methylaminato] in the presence of 2−6 atm of molecular oxygen in ethanol at 20−80 °C (Scheme 31). 62,63 Only terminal alkenes are found to be reactive in this catalytic system. The reaction occurs in ethanol or methanol but not in tert-butyl or isopropyl alcohol. The alcohol is concomitantly oxidized during the reaction and may act as a coreducing agent and/or favor the formation of cobalt hydride. The ratio of the hydrated product to the oxidized product is influenced by the concentration of ethanol, although the ketone is produced as the major product in all cases. Hydroperoxide has been proposed as a key intermediate for this system (Scheme 32).

Cobalt(II)−β-diketone complexes having electron-withdrawing groups have been studied for the aerobic hydration of alkenes (Scheme 33). 64 Addition of molecular sieves or azeotropic removal of water increases the yield of the desired alcohol significantly. Because the conventional method of hydration of alkenes is performed under strongly acidic conditions, functionalized alkenes having ester, amide, or acetal groups cannot be usually employed, 65 whereas even alkenes containing an acetal group can be hydrated to give the desired product in high yield using the cobalt(II)-catalyzed systems because of their neutral conditions. Nishinaga and co-workers reported the enantioselective aerobic hydration of styrene to phenylethanol in 38% ee using chiral R-Co−salen 38 in 2-propanol (Scheme 34). 66,67

3.3. Rhodium Catalysts
Rhodium complexes are found to be effective catalysts for the selective oxidation of terminal alkenes to methyl ketones with molecular oxygen. 68,69 Among the several catalytic systems investigated, the combination of RhCl3 and Cu(ClO4)2 or Cu(NO3)2 is more effective, and several substrates have been oxidized to the corresponding methyl ketones in ethanol at ambient temperature (Scheme 35).69b Both oxygen atoms are incorporated into 2 mol of alkene to give 2 mol of ketone with selectivity up to 98%, based on the consumed alkene and molecular oxygen (Scheme 36). The mechanism of this reaction is different from the conventional Wacker chemistry as, in this system, water is not involved as the oxygen source. In fact, it is an inhibitor, and the presence of a dehydrating agent such as 2,2-dimethoxypropane speeds the reaction. This clearly suggests that molecular oxygen is the source of the oxygen atom present in the formed ketone, and the classical Wacker type mechanism is not operative under these conditions.
Scheme 35
Scheme 36
The rhodium−molecular oxygen complex RhCl(O2)(PPh3)2 transfers both oxygen atoms to 1 mol of coordinated 1,5-cyclooctadiene to give cyclooctane-1,4-dione, without the intermediate formation of monoketone (Scheme 37). 70 In the presence of excess of PPh3, the reaction becomes slightly catalytic.
Scheme 37
3.4. Osmium Catalysts
Osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation of alkenes is reported with molecular oxygen at normal pressure in a basic two-phase system. 71 Both oxygen atoms are incorporated into the product in an atom-efficient manner. The diols are obtained in high yields, and the catalyst can be recycled (Scheme 38). Importantly, the use of chiral quinine and quinidine ligands leads to asymmetric dihydroxylation with good enantioselectivity (Table 5).

4. Wacker Oxidation
The oxidation of alkenes based on palladium complexes has evolved into highly useful methodologies in organic synthesis (eq 2).
The Wacker−Hoechst acetaldehyde process, the oxidation of propene to acetone, the acetoxylation of ethene to vinyl acetate and that of propene to allyl acetate, and the diacetoxylation of butadiene to 1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene are important commercial processes. A number of books and review articles have been published on these systems.7e,72,73 The following section reviews the progress achieved on the Wacker type of oxidation using different catalytic systems.
4.1. Oxidation to Ketones
The oxidation of terminal alkenes by the Wacker system consisting of PdCl2/CuCl2 with molecular oxygen to methyl ketones is a well-established and important process in both synthetic and industrial chemistry. However, it has some disadvantages caused by the chlorine anion, which leads to the formation of chlorinated byproducts and corrodes the reactor, and is not suitable for the oxidation of higher alkenes. To overcome such drawbacks, much attention has been focused on developing halide-free catalytic systems.
Pd(OAc)2 has been used in combination with polyaniline74a and pyridine/2-propanol74b for the oxidation of terminal alkenes to methyl ketones in the presence of molecular oxygen (Scheme 39). Methanol, ethanol, and 2-butanol have also been employed as coreductants, but they are less effective, affording the ketones in <26% yield.74b Sheldon and co-workers studied the water-soluble palladium(II) complex 39 for the oxidation of alkenes in a biphase system at 100 °C.75 The terminal alkenes are oxidized to the corresponding methyl ketones in 48−50% conversion and 100% selectivity (Scheme 40). In the case of cyclic alkenes such as cyclooctene the oxidation leads to cyclooctanone (100% selectivity), whereas cyclohexene and cyclopentene give a mixture of compounds (∼50%) due to allylic oxidation. The addition of sodium acetate is necessary for this system to prevent the formation of inactive dimers, giant palladium clusters or even colloidal palladium. To rationalize these results, a mechanism is proposed as shown in Scheme 41. In the first step a palladium dimer with two bridging hydroxy ligands is dissociated via coordination of the alkene. This is followed by intramolecular attack of hydroxide on the coordinated alkene. The resulting β-hydroxyalkyl−palladium complex decomposes into 2-alkanone and a zero-valent palladium species. The latter is reoxidized with molecular oxygen, giving palladium peroxide, which on coupling with 1 equiv of zero-valent palladium regenerates the starting palladium dimer.
Scheme 39
Scheme 40
Scheme 41
Few studies have focused on the combined use of palladium(II) salts and polyoxometalates. Ishii and co-workers reported that Pd(OAc)2 in combination with NPMoV/hydroquinone76a and NPMoV/C76b catalyzes efficiently the oxidation of series alkenes to the corresponding ketones in high yields (Scheme 42). The supported catalyst is recyclable without loss of activity. Monflier and co-workers carried out a biphase oxidation of 1-decene to 2-decanone in 98% yield (Scheme 43).76c,d In this case, a three-component catalytic system, PdSO4, PMo6V6O409-, and CuSO4, is used, where Cu(II) is suggested to promote the palladium reoxidation. The key point about this is the use of a β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) as a phase-transfer catalyst, which transfers 1-decene to the aqueous phase by a host−guest interaction. The catalytic system composed of PdCl2, H5PV2Mo10O40, and KCl catalyzes the oxidation of propene to acetone in 89% conversion in poly(ethylene glycol).76e
Scheme 42
Scheme 43
Palladium salts supported on TiO2 have been used for the oxidation of terminal alkenes.77 Thus, by a combined use of PdSO4, V2O5, and TiO2, the oxidation of 1-butene to 2-butanone is reported at 49−120 °C in a continuous fixed-bed stainless steel reactor.77a The composition of this catalyst appears to be of major influence on its performance. Although the selectivity of 2-butanone is high (83%), its yield decreases rapidly from 23 to 9% due to loss of the activity of the catalyst (∼60% in the first 100 h of operation), whereas the Pd-nanocluster supported on TiO2 catalyzes the oxidation of a series of alkenes in the presence of CuCl2.77b 1-Decene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-dodecene, vinylcyclohexene, and n-butyl vinyl ether have been converted to the corresponding methyl ketones in 87−94% yield.
4.2. Oxidation to Aldehydes
The Wacker-type oxidation is very efficient in oxidizing alkenes to the corresponding aldehydes. Thus, the oxidation of N-allyl-N-methylbenzamides 40 to aldehydes 41 and ketones 42 is reported using the catalytic system composed of (MeCN)2PdCl2/CuCl and HMPA under anhydrous conditions with molecular oxygen (Scheme 44).78a In the case of 1,5-dienes, one of the double bonds can be selectively converted to aldehyde without affecting the other double bond to afford the corresponding olefinic aldehyde in the presence of PdCl2/CuCl in DMF−H2O.78b Feringa studied the Wacker oxidation of terminal alkenes to aldehydes using (MeCN)2PdClNO2/CuCl2 in t-BuOH, whereas homoallylic alcohols are transformed into the corresponding cyclic acetals in high yields (Scheme 45).79
Scheme 44
Scheme 45
4.3. Acetal Formation
Murahashi and co-workers reported the asymmetric acetal formation from methacrylamide 43 using PdCl2/CuCl in methanol under oxygen atmosphere (Scheme 46).80 This reaction proceeds with high chemoselectivity and 95% diastereomeric excess. Reductive cleavage of the auxiliary yields acetal 44, which has been used in the synthesis of an α,β-methylcarbapenem 45. This route provides an alternative to the enzymatic synthesis of (S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoic acid. The catalytic system composed of NPMoV and hydroquinone (HQ) catalyzes the acetal formation of monosubstituted alkenes in acetic acid, whereas cyclic alkenes undergo allylic oxidation to give the corresponding allylic acetates in high yield (Scheme 47).76a
Scheme 46
Scheme 47
4.4. Intramolecular Alkoxypalladation
Intramolecular alkoxypalladation is another Wacker type of reaction, which gives rise to the synthesis of cyclic ethers.81 Following the Murahashi synthesis of tetrahydrofurans by oxidative cyclization of γ,δ-unsaturated alcohols with molecular oxygen using Pd(OAc)2 and Cu(OAc)2,81a intramolecular oxidative cyclization of aliphatic alcohols,81c-e phenols,81b,f,g and β-hydroxyenones81h is reported. The cyclization of o-allylphenols is performed using Pd(TFA)2 in the presence of 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ)81f or Ca(OH)2.81g In the presence of chiral bis-oxazolyl-1,1-binaphthyl ligand81f46 or (−)-sparteine81g47, the corresponding cyclic ethers are formed in high enantioselectivity (Scheme 48). The cyclization of β-hydroxyenones is reported by the combined use of PdCl2, CuCl, and Na2HPO4.81h This system can be used for the transformation of enantiopure β-hydroxyenone to 2,3-dihydro-4H-pyran-4-one without loss of the optical purity (Scheme 49).
Scheme 48
Scheme 49
4.5. Acetoxylation and Related Reactions
Palladium-catalyzed acetoxylation of alkenes using acetic acid is a successful commercial process.82 Larock and Hightower studied the intramolecular cyclization of alkenoic acid to the corresponding lactone in high yield using Pd(OAc)2 in DMSO in the presence of molecular oxygen (Scheme 50).83
Scheme 50
Backvall and co-workers explored the oxidation of cyclic alkenes using a catalytic system consisting of Pd(OAc)2, quinone, and Co−salophen in the presence of molecular oxygen.84 In particular, five-, six- and seven-membered cyclic alkenes are oxidized to the corresponding allylic carboxylates.85 Cyclohexene is quantitatively oxidized to 1-acetoxy-2-cyclohexene in only 2 h in acetic acid at 60 °C. Other oxygen-activating catalysts such as heteropolyacid86 and metal−macrocycles84,85 can be employed for this transformation in the place of Co−salophen (Scheme 51).
Scheme 51
Several studies have focused on the regio- and stereoselective palladium-catalyzed 1,4-oxidation of conjugated dienes to 1,4-diacetates.87 These reactions proceed at room temperature in acetic acid in the presence of a lithium carboxylate and benzoquinone, and the conditions are milder than those required for the acetylation of monoalkenes (Scheme 52).
Scheme 52
Intramolecular versions of the 1,4-oxidations have been developed.88,89 Backvall and co-workers have elegantly demonstrated an intramolecular cyclization of cyclohexadiene acetic acid to the corresponding cis-fused γ-lactone. This reaction occurs via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the carboxylic group in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner, leading to a cis-fused heterocycle. The lactone formation is occurring by a successive intramolecular and intermolecular nucleophilic attack. In the first instance, the carboxylate attacks intramolecularly to the diene complexed with palladium in an anti fashion. This cyclization subsequently leads to a π-allyl palladium complex, which is attacked intermolecularly by acetic acid, leading to the observed stereochemistry. The intermolecular attack by acetic acid has been elegantly controlled by manipulation of the reaction conditions, which lead to a syn or anti lactone (Scheme 53).
Scheme 53
4.6. Aminopalladation
In a π-allyl palladium complex, the addition of amines often results in the displacement of the alkene from the palladium complex.7e This problem has been circumvented by using amides, carbomates, and urea.90 Thus, intramolecular aminopalladation or Pd-mediated aminocarbonylation of alkenes and allenes has widely employed the amide as a source of nitrogen in the synthesis of nitrogen-containing five- and six-membered heterocycles.91 The Pd(II)-catalyzed 5-exo cyclization of aminals in DMSO with molecular oxygen is illustrative, and it is found that formamides are superior nucleophiles to free amines in these oxidations (Scheme 54).92
Scheme 54
5. Allylic Oxidation
Allylic oxidation of alkenes is a fundamental and important functional transformation in synthetic chemistry.93 Many studies are focused on the allylic oxidation of alkenes with transition metal catalysts.7f This section covers the various catalytic systems employed for the allylic oxidation of alkenes with molecular oxygen and transition metal catalysts. The reactions with palladium catalysts are incorporated in the Wacker-type oxidation.
5.1. Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
Ishii and co-workers reported the allylic oxidation of isophorone using polyoxometalates, NPMoV and NPMoV/S (S = C, SiO2, or Al2O3), in the presence of molecular oxygen (Scheme 55).94 The best performance available is a 15:1 mixture of 3-formyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one and keto-isophorone with 81% yield in the presence of NPMoV/C. This result is particularly important because the conventional oxidations usually provide the regioisomer, keto-isophorone.95 The pore size of the supports appears to be an important factor governing the regioselectivity in these reactions.
Scheme 55
5.2. Manganese Catalysts
The chiral manganese Schiff base complex 48 has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of cyclohexene into a mixture of cyclohexenol, cyclohexenone, and cyclohexenyl hydroperoxide without a coreductant under oxygen atmosphere (Scheme 56).96 The influence of reaction temperature and additive on the product distribution has been studied.
Scheme 56
5.3. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt catalysts have been studied for the allylic oxidation of alkenes in the presence as well as absence of coreductants. Lajunen and co-workers carried out the oxidation of neat α-pinene using Co(4-methylpyridine)2Br2 at 50 °C in 10% glacial acetic acid under a flow of oxygen where trans-verbenol (16%) and verbenone (46%) are obtained as the major compounds along with a trace of epoxide (Scheme 57).97 The zeolite-Y-supported Co−salophen 49 (49−Y) catalyzes regioselectively (100%) the oxidation of isophorone to 3-formyl-5,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one in quantitative yield at ambient conditions.98 The catalytic activity and selectivity of the encapsulated catalyst 49−Y are significantly higher than those of its homogeneous analogue 49. Iqbal and co-workers reported the allylic oxidation of cyclic alkenes with 30a in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and atmospheric oxygen (Scheme 58).99 By this method, cyclopentene can be oxidized to cyclopentenol in 71% yield, whereas cyclohexene, cycloheptene, and carene provide a mixture of the corresponding enols and enones in good yields.
Scheme 57
Scheme 58
6. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkanes to Alkenes
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes (C2−C6) in a flow of oxygen for the production of short-chain alkenes is one of the novel routes currently proposed for the exploitation of natural gas as a raw material for highly priced and clean chemicals (eq 3).
It is exothermal and takes place at lower temperature than the conventional dehydrogenation process. Also, the amount of heat released and the presence of oxygen in the ODH limits coke deposition, thus preventing a loss of catalytic activity. However, the key point of the ODH is the development of catalysts capable of activating only the C−H bonds of alkanes to alkenes in the presence of oxygen. The selectivity of the ODH products depends on the specific alkane fed, on the metal content of the catalysts, and on the nature of the matrix and/or support in which metal atoms are incorporated.100 The following section reviews the recent progress of this reaction catalyzed by transition metal salts.
6.1. Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
The large majority of the catalysts studied for the ODH of lighter alkanes are based on the chemistry of vanadium oxides. 100-122 Their catalytic behavior is usually modified when deposited on SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and MgO with new surface structure.101-121 The most profound changes are frequently observed at low vanadium loading, not exceeding a monolayer, and species in the monolayer display higher catalytic activity and/or selectivity than the bulk V2O5. The ODH of C2−C5 alkanes and vinylcyclohexene are reported with 10−60% conversion and 52−100% selectivity (Table 6).102,103,119-122

Molybdenum-based catalysts have been studied for the ODH of C2−C4 alkanes 123-127 and ethylbenzene 128 (Table 7). A recent comprehensive study of propane ODH over SiO2-supported molybdate-based catalysts of the formula NMoO4 (N = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and Zn) reports a maximum conversion of 34% (47% selectivity) with Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2.123 As compared to the ODH catalysts, which give rise to alkenes, the Ni−Co−molybdate catalyzes a complete oxidation of the initial propene to CO and CO2 under different reaction conditions (Scheme 59). The ODH of C2−C4 alkanes has shown 4−39% conversion and 15−72% selectivity,123,125-127 whereas ethylbenzene is converted to styrene with 98% yield.128

6.2. Chromium Catalysts
Few studies have focused on the ODH of C2−C4 alkanes using chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2. 129,130 The ODH of C3−C4 alkanes has shown 21% conversion and 45% selectivity, whereas ethane is converted to ethene in 20% conversion and 6% selectivity.
6.3. Manganese Catalysts
Au and co-workers reported that the halide-doped perovskite-type oxides, AMn1-xCuxO3-δXσ (A = La0.8Ba0.2; X = F or Cl), catalyze the ODH of ethane with up to 73% conversion and 69.5% selectivity in the presence of molecular oxygen. 131 The addition of halide ions to the perovskites reduces deep ethene oxidation. X-ray powder diffraction results indicate that at x = 0.3 the halide-doped AMn1-xCuxO3-δXσ (X = F or Cl) products are single-phase and cubic in structure. However, when the x value exceeds 0.7, there are trace amounts of La2CuO4 and/or CuO phases besides the perovskite phase. Similarly, the alumina-supported mixed metal oxide, LaMnO3/γAl2O3, has been shown to catalyze the ODH of ethane with 84% conversion and 65% selectivity in the presence of molecular oxygen. 132
6.4. Iron Catalysts
Iron phosphate phases [FePO4, Fe2P2O7, α-Fe3(P2O7)2, and β-Fe3(P2O7)2] have been studied for the ODH of ethane at temperatures ranging from 400 to 675 °C.133a The catalyst with a P/Fe ratio of 1.2:1 is found to more efficiently catalyze the ODH of ethane, with 42% conversion and 84% selectivity under atmospheric pressure.
6.5. Ruthenium Catalysts
Alumina-supported ruthenium hydroxides, Ru(OH)x/Al2O3, have been studied for the ODH of a series of alkylbenzenes with quantitative yields under molecular oxygen.133b The recovered catalyst is reusable without loss of activity.
6.6. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt−titania (Co/TiO2)134,135 and cobalt−zeolite (CoH−BEA−zeolite)136 catalysts of different cobalt content prepared by impregnation have been studied for the ODH of C2−C3 alkanes. The best conversions available are 28% (67% selectivity) for ethane to ethene and 8% (41% selectivity) for propane to propene, respectively.
6.7. Nickel Catalysts
Nickel oxide (NiO) supported on ThO2, CeO2, MgO, Al2O3, and SiO2 has been tested for the ODH of C2−C4 alkanes. 137-139 NiO dispersed on Al2O3 catalyzed the ODH of ethane with 59.1% conversion and 65.3% selectivity.137 The catalytic system using Ce−Ni−O is found to be efficient for the ODH of C3−C4 alkanes, providing 10−19% conversion and 59−60% selectivity.138,139
6.8. Platinum Catalysts
Most of the data reported on the partial oxidation of light alkanes with platinum-based catalysts refer to low surface area Pt-coated Al2O3 foam monoliths. 140-142 Schmidt and co-workers reported very high yields of alkenes in the ODH of C2−C6 alkanes over Pt-coated α-Al2O3 foam monoliths operating adiabatically at short contact times (a few milliseconds) under atmospheric pressure and at 700−900 °C.140a In the cases of C2−C4 alkanes, almost complete conversion of the alkanes and selectivities to alkenes of >60% are reported. They have also demonstrated that platinum is the best catalyst compared to rhodium and palladium for the ODH of alkanes at very short contact times. They have found, for instance, that rhodium mainly produces CO/H2 mixtures, whereas palladium rapidly undergoes deactivation due to coking. Flick and Huff compared the performance of a Pt/α-Al2O3 monolith with that of a much higher surface area in Pt/γ-Al2O3 pellets and found that the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is active in the ODH of ethane with 85% conversion (50% selectivity) under adiabatic operation at few-millisecond contact times.141 Pt/Sn/γ-Al2O3 is investigated for the ODH of n-butane with 22% conversion (20% selectivity) at 450 °C under atmospheric pressure.142
7. Oxygenation of Alkanes
The conversion of alkanes to oxygen-containing compounds with molecular oxygen catalyzed by transition metals is one of the most important and fundamental transformations in industrial chemistry. 143,144 There have been a number of publications that have dealt with this problem, and this section surveys the recent studies of this reaction.
7.1. Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
The oxidation of alkanes catalyzed by vanadium- and molybdenum-based catalysts can be divided into three groups:  (i) VPO-catalyzed reactions; (ii) molybdenum-based mixed metal oxides (MMO) and polyoxometalates catalyzed reactions; and (iii) silica-supported vanadium- and molybdenum-catalyzed partial oxidations.
7.1.1. VPO Catalysts
For the selective oxidation of alkanes, there is one successful commercial example since 1970:  n-butane replacing benzene as the starting material to produce maleic anhydride over a VPO catalyst (Figure 1). 145 The reported yields of maleic anhydride vary from 45 to 67%, with n-butane conversion at ∼90% and selectivity to maleic anhydride ranging from 65% to as high as 97% (Scheme 60). 146,147 Although the performance varies somewhat depending on the catalyst preparation and modifiers, the VPO catalysts are very effective in n-butane oxidation as reflected by the high conversion and high selectivity to maleic anhydride.
Figure 1
Scheme 60
The success of VPO catalysts in the n-butane oxidation has stimulated great interests in the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid (Scheme 61). Table 8 lists the composition and performance of various VPO type catalysts tested for the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. 148-154 The composition Ce/VPO is more active and provides 18.8% of acrylic acid with 68% selectivity.154 On the basis of the excellent performance of VPO for converting n-butane to maleic anhydride, it is reasonable to believe that they have real potential for converting propane to acrylic acid more effectively. The future of VPO catalysis research for propane oxidation needs to rely on a good understanding and systematic studies of the structural origin, such as active phases and active species. Once the active phases or active sites of the catalysts are identified, be they amorphous or crystal phases, it would be a challenging task to prepare the catalyst to increase its active site density.

7.1.2. Mixed Metal Oxides and Polyoxometalates
Molybdenum-based mixed metal oxides 155-163 (MMOs) and polyoxometalates 164-169 have been studied for the oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. Although the history of the MMOs in propane to acrylic acid is relatively short, they have shown to date excellent conversion (80%) and selectivity (60%) (Table 9), whereas the actual yield of acrylic acid with polyoxometalates is relatively low (10.8% with 21.5% selectivity), but there is no follow-up for more than a decade on this important transformation.166,167

7.1.3. Silica-Supported Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
Several studies are focused on the silica-supported vanadium- and molybdenum-catalyzed partial oxidation of alkanes. 170,171 Kobayashi and co-workers carried out the oxidations of ethane and propane to a mixture of acetaldehyde and acrolein in 2.8% conversion (62% selectivity) using Cs/V/SiO2 (Cs/V/Si = 10:1:1000) at 400−600 °C.170a The presence of cesium in the catalyst increases the basicity and neutralizes the acid site of the catalyst. Fierro and co-workers reviewed the partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen.171a Many studies are focused on the oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde over vanadium catalysts. V2O5/SiO2 is widely investigated, and its catalytic activity and selectivity are related to the appearance of dispersed vanadium on the silica surface. The reaction is reported to proceed via a Mars−van Krevelen mechanism in which the lattice oxygen is incorporated in the formaldehyde, whereas the consumed oxygen is restored by molecular oxygen from the gas phase. Addition of NO in the feed increases the yield as well as the selectivity of the C1-oxygenates. The best result available is 40% conversion and 40% selectivity in the presence of NO (0−2.92% vol) at 550 °C.171b This is the highest conversion so far available for the oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure. It has been proposed that the NO gas alters the CH3• and CH3O2• radical ratio and promotes the activation of methane.
Molybdenum-based catalysts have been widely investigated for the partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen.171a Most of the studies are focused on the molybdenum dispersed on silica, MoO3/SiO2, the catalytic activity and selectivity of which depend on both the Mo-loading and its preparation. This catalytic system has also shown that the oxygen incorporated in the formaldehyde is from the lattice molybdenum oxide and not from the gas phase molecular oxygen, and the role of molecular oxygen is to restore the oxidation state of the molybdenum (Mars−van Krevelen cycle). Zeolites, instead of silica, have been used as carriers to prepare molybdenum oxide catalysts for the methane oxidation. The resulting MoO3/zeolite systems exhibited moderate activity and selectivity during the formaldehyde formation.
7.2. Manganese Catalysts
Manganese catalysts have been studied for the oxidation of cyclic alkanes. Thomas and co-workers reported the oxidation of cyclohexane into a mixture of cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and adipic acid using MnAlPO and air in high TON (Scheme 62),172a-c whereas the catalytic system with polyfluorinated manganese complex converts cyclooctane into a 5:3 mixture of cyclooctanone and cyclooctanol in 44946 TON under molecular oxgyen.172d The corresponding supported catalysts on SiO2, polystyrene, and montmorillonite K10 are recyclable but less active (up to 10000 TON) compared to the homogeneous systems.
Scheme 62
7.3. Iron Catalysts
Iron catalysts have been studied for the oxygenation of alkanes with a variety of ligands (Table 10). Most of these studies are focused on the partial oxidation of alkanes to alcohols and ketones.

7.3.1. Reactions without Coreductants
Lyons and Ellis reported the oxidation of neat acyclic alkanes using iron−haloporphyrins under molecular oxygen (1−5 atm).5b Isobutane is oxidized to tert-butyl alcohol in 20000 TON in the presence of Fe(TPPF20β-Br8)OH [TPPF20β-Br8 = tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl β-octabromo)porphyrin] at 100 °C. Although in this reaction the catalyst decomposition is a problem at somewhat elevated temperatures (>60 °C), well over 10000 catalytic turnovers can be reached at ambient temperature with no decay of the catalyst (Scheme 63). Similarly, the oxidation of propane to a 1:1.1 mixture of isopropyl alcohol and acetone is reported with 541 TON in the presence of Fe(TPPF20β-Br8)N3 at 125 °C. However, substituted alkanes such as 2-methylbutane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, and 1,2,3-trimethylbutane are oxidized into a mixture of products due to oxidative cleavage of the carbon−carbon bond. The postulated mechanisms for these reactions are similar to those proposed for the biological oxidations by cytochrome P-450 and methanemonooxygenase (Scheme 64).5b Gray and co-workers studied the oxidation of 3-methylpentane to 3-hydroxy-3-methylpentane (>99% selectivity) using iron−haloporphyrins and molecular oxygen in benzene at 60 °C.5c The product selectivity and radical trap experiment suggest that this reaction takes place by an autoxidation process (Scheme 65).
Scheme 63
Scheme 64
Scheme 65
Few studies have focused on the use of iron-based polyoxometalates and aluminophosphates for the oxidation of cyclic alkanes. Mizuno and co-workers investigated the heteropolyoxometalates [PW9O37][Fe2Ni(OAc)3]10- and γ-SiW10(Fe(OH2))2O386- for the oxidation of adamantane173 and cyclohexane,174 respectively. Both of the substrates are oxidized into a mixture of alcohol and ketone with up to 147 TON. Results obtained with the radical initiator and scavenger suggest that these reactions involve a radical pathway. Thomas and co-workers described the oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid with air in the presence of Fe−AlPO-31.172a,b This molecular sieve has narrow pores, with a 0.54-nm diameter. Cyclohexane is easily adsorbed in the micropores, but desorption of initial products such as cyclohexylperoxide or cyclohexanone is slow. Consequently, subsequent radical reactions occur until the cyclohexyl ring is broken to form linear products that are sufficiently mobile to diffuse out of the molecular sieve. In contrast, with a larger pore Fe−AlPO-5, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone account for ∼60% of the oxidation products. Thus, localization of a free radical reaction inside micropores seems to give rise to particular selectivities.
7.3.2. Reactions Involving Coreductants
Barton and co-workers extensively studied the oxidation of alkanes since 1983 by Gif systems.175 These systems exhibit unusual selectivities and occur in pyridine in the presence of an organic acid and iron as the catalyst. For example, the oxidation of cyclohexane has been carried out into a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in 36% conversion using FeCl3 in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and picolinic acid (Scheme 66).175j This system functions at ambient temperature in acetonitrile under nearly neutral pH, and the hydrogen sulfide is oxidized to sulfide. Stavropoulos and co-workers studied the oxidation of a series of alkanes to a mixture of alcohols and ketones using iron catalyst in the presence of zinc powder in pyridine and acetic acid mixture (10:1 v/v).176
Scheme 66
All Gif systems have the same chemical peculiarities:  (i) the major products of the reaction are ketones, and alcohols are not reaction intermediates; (ii) the presence of an excess of some easily oxidizable compounds (ROH and RCHO) does not significantly suppress the alkane oxidation; (iii) the selectivity of oxidation for branched hydrocarbons is secondary > tertiary > primary; (iv) secondary alkyl free radicals are not reaction intermediates; (v) alkenes are not epoxidized; and (vi) the addition of trapping reagents can divert the reaction to form monosubstituted alkyl derivatives instead of ketones.
Several studies have subsequently focused on the aerobic oxidation of alkanes using various iron catalysts. Most of these reactions are focused on the oxidation of cyclic alkanes in the presence of PPh3, sulfides, and aldehydes. The silica-supported iron complex 51 has been shown to catalyze selectively the oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol with 108 TON in the presence of propane-1,3-dithiol and PPh3.177 Martell and co-workers carried out the oxidation of cyclohexane and adamantane using 50 in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and pyridine (Scheme 67).178 Cyclohexane is oxidized to a 2:1 mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone with 36 TON, whereas adamantane is converted into a 5:4 mixture of adamantan-3-ol and adamantan-2-ol with 45 TON. Similarly, the iron−porphyrin complex,179 Fe(TPFPP)Cl, the halogenated phthalocyanine iron(II) complex18052 and iron nanoparticles181a-c have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of cyclohexane into a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in the presence of aliphatic aldehydes.
Scheme 67
7.3.3. Photooxygenation Reactions
Shul'pin and co-workers extensively studied the oxidation of alkanes using FeCl3 and Fe(ClO4)3 with atmospheric oxygen under irradiation.182 Hydroperoxide is proposed as the intermediate for these reactions, which undergoes decomposition to alcohol and aldehyde/ketone. The ratio of alcohol and aldehyde/ketone depends on the reaction conditions. Maldotti and co-workers reported the selective oxidation of cyclohexane using 53 under irradiation in the presence of molecular oxygen (0.2−1 atm) at ambient temperature.183 The product distribution depends on the reaction conditions. Oxidation of neat cyclohexane using 53a provides only cyclohexanol, whereas the use of a polar solvent (CH2Cl2) with phenyl tert-butylnitrone (pbn) leads to exclusive formation of cyclohexanone. This significant difference in their selectivity could be due to the formation of different species (cleavage of O−O bonds) in polar and nonpolar media (Scheme 68). Iron(III)−porphyrins have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of alkane to a mixture of alcohol and ketone (the alcohol/ketone ratio ranges from 0.8 to 2.7) in the presence of triethanolamine.184
Scheme 68
7.4. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt-based catalysts are mainly studied for the partial oxidation of alkanes to alcohols and ketones.
7.4.1. Reactions without Coreductants
The aerobic oxidation of alkanes catalyzed by Co(OAc)3 has been thoroughly investigated due to its relevance to industrial homolytic oxidation processes.185 The weakly solvated complex containing acetonitrile, [Co(CH3CN)4](PF6)2, catalyzes the oxidation of adamantane and cyclohexane at 75 °C.186 The commercial catalyst for cyclohexane oxidation does not function under these conditions. In these reactions, the metal ions function as an initiator as well as a hydroperoxide decomposition catalyst. Ishii and co-workers studied the oxidation of alkanes into a mixture of ketones and carboxylic acids in moderate to high yields by the combined use of Co(acac)2 and NHPI in CH3COOH at 40−100 °C (Scheme 69).187a,b Co−AlPO-5 and Co−AlPO-11 with different cobalt contents have been shown to catalyze the autoxidation of neat cyclohexane.187c At 130 °C in neat cyclohexane, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, cyclohexanol, and cyclohexanone are formed (8% conversion and 94% selectivity) in a ratio of free radical reaction. The Co−AlPO-18 catalyzes the oxidation of n-hexane to adipic acid (9.5% conversion and 32% selectivity) under molecular oxygen.187d It is unclear whether the unusual selectivities are solely a consequence of framework effects or due to a direct reaction of the strongly oxidizing Co3+ with the hydrocarbon. However, these catalysts can be recycled without loss of activity.
Scheme 69
7.4.2. Reactions Involving Coreductants
Few studies are focused on the use of cobalt(II) catalysts for the oxidation of alkanes in the presence of aliphatic aldehydes and molecular oxygen. The complexes 54188 and 29a189 have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of alkanes into a mixture of alcohols and ketones in the presence of acetaldehyde and 2-methylpropanal, respectively. Similarly, cobalt nanoparticles catalyze the oxidation of neat adamantane and cyclohexane into a mixture of alcohols and ketones in 57−67% conversion in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen.181a These systems are as effective as the iron nanoparticles catalyzed protocols.
7.5. Iridium Catalyst
The oxidation of neat THF has been studied using IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 at ambient conditions.190 γ-Butyrolactone is formed with 150 TON along with a trace lactol and 4-hydroxybutyraldehyde (Scheme 70).
Scheme 70
7.6. Palladium Catalysts
A bimetallic catalytic system consisting of metallic palladium and CuCl2 is applied for the low-temperature selective oxidation of methane, ethane, and propane with molecular oxygen (Scheme 71).191 It operates in a 3:1 mixture (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid and water in the presence of molecular oxygen and CO. Methane is selectively converted to methanol (216 TON based on Pd), whereas both C−H and C−C cleavage products are observed for ethane and propane, resulting in the formation of methanol, ethanol, and acetic acid. The rate of formation of methanol from methane with the bimetallic system is ∼65 × 10-4 M/min at 145−150 °C. This rate may be compared to the rate of formation of acetic acid from methanol in the benchmark Monsanto process:  380 × 10-4 M/min at 180 °C.
Scheme 71
The modification of Gif-type reactions using hydrogen peroxide formed in situ by the palladium-catalyzed combining of oxygen and hydrogen is reported.192a The oxidation of cyclohexane in the solvent mixture, acetone−acetic acid, gives cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in rather high yields, but any solvent containing pyridine is not suitable for this modified system. The oxidation of methane to acetic acid is reported in concentrated H2SO4 using a combination of PdSO4, CuCl2, and molecular oxygen.192b CuCl2 and molecular oxygen appear to promote the rate of oxidation of Pd(0) to Pd(II) during the catalytic cycle, thereby inhibiting the deposition of palladium black.
7.7. Copper Catalysts
Most of the copper-catalyzed oxidation of alkanes has been performed in the presence of coreductants. Neckers and Kurusu investigated the oxidation of cyclohexane into a 3.3:1 mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in 4.3% conversion (134 TON) by the copper complex immobilized on silica gel in the presence of zinc powder and acetic acid under molecular oxygen.193 Shul'pin and coworkers reported the oxidation of cyclohexane into a 50:1 mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone by the combined use of quinone and Cu(OAc)2 (ratio 5:1) in acetonitrile with air and PPh3 under irradiation (Scheme 72).194 In this reaction, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide is formed first, which, on reaction with PPh3, gives cyclohexanol and Ph3PO. The complex consisting of CuCl2−crown ether catalyzes the oxidation of cyclohexane, cyclooctane, and n-hexane to their corresponding alcohols and ketones in 9330−18600 TON in the presence of acetaldehyde under atmospheric oxygen (Scheme 73).195a These are high turnovers in the aerobic oxidation of unactivated alkanes, whereas the oxidation of n-hexane to a mixture of hexan-1-ol and hexanal in 10.2% conversion catalyzed by the zeolite (NaY) supported copper−perchlorophthalocyanine operates without a coreductant under molecular oxygen.195b Remarkably, the oxidation takes place only at the primary CH3 group. This unusual product distribution weighs strongly against a free radical mechanism, which would normally be expected for a copper-catalyzed oxidation reaction.
Scheme 72
Scheme 73
7.8. Gold Catalysts
Oxidation of cyclohexane to a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone is reported over calcined Au/ZSM-5 molecular sieve with molecular oxygen.195b The best result available with this catalyst is 16% conversion (2242 TON) and 92% selectivity at 150 °C. This reaction operates in a solvent-free system, and the catalyst can be recycled twice without loss of activity.
7.9. Platinum Catalyst
Neumann and co-workers reported the oxidation of methane into a mixture of methanol (46%), formaldehyde (9%), and acetaldehyde (41%) in 33 TON using [Pt(bipyrimidinyl)Cl2]+[H4PV2Mo10O40]-/SiO2 and molecular oxygen.195c The most likely scenario for acetaldehyde formation is the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde via methanol, followed by its coupling with methane to yield the product, possibly occurring entirely in the coordination sphere of the catalyst.
8. Benzylic Oxidation
Benzylic oxidation is an important and fundamental functional transformation in industrial chemistry.196 Several reagents and methods have been developed for this purpose. This section covers the various catalytic systems that have been used for the oxidation of benzylic substrates with molecular oxygen and transition metal catalysts.
8.1. Vanadium Catalysts
Vanadium-based polyoxometalates have been shown to catalyze efficiently the oxidation of benzylic substrates under oxygen atmosphere.197 Neumann and co-workers reported the oxidation of alkylbenzene by the Keggin-type polyfluorooxometalate, [H2F6NaVVW17O56]8-, in a biphase system (water−catalyst and substrate) (Table 11).197a The substrates having secondary and tertiary benzylic C−H bonds are oxidized to a mixture of the corresponding alcohols and ketones in high TON, whereas the substrates with primary C−H bonds mainly give alkenes due to the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The polyoxometalate, V−Cs−Cu−Tl, has been subsequently shown to catalyze the oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde with 16.5% yield.197b

8.2. Manganese Catalysts
Ishii and co-workers studied the oxidation of 3-methylpyridine and methylquinoline by the combined use of Mn(OAc)2, Co(OAc)2, and NHPI in the presence of a small amount of NO2 as an initiator in CH3COOH (Scheme 74).198a,b This method selectively oxidizes the methyl group to aldehyde in 60−75% yield without affecting the N atom of the substrate. Ratnasamy and co-workers reported the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid in 99.4% yield using a recyclable zeolite-encapsulated Co/Mn cluster with molecular oxygen,198c whereas the reaction using the manganese porphyrin complex 54a catalyzes the oxidation of ethylbenzene to a 3:14 mixture of phenylethanol and acetophenone in the presence of acetaldehyde and molecular oxygen (Scheme 75).188
Scheme 74
Scheme 75
8.3. Iron Catalysts
Evans and Smith studied the oxidation of ethylbenzene using iron−haloporphyrins in a solvent-free system under molecular oxygen at 30−110 °C (Table 12).198d A mixture of hydroperoxide, phenylethanol, and acetophenone is obtained with up to 25000 TON using the μ-oxocomplex [Fe(TPFPP)]2O [TPFPP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin]. They have subsequently supported FeTF4PP [TF4PP = tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin] on SiO2 and polystyrene to afford SiFeTF4PP and PS−FeTF4PP 55, which catalyze the oxidation of ethylbenzene to a mixture of alcohol, ketone, and hydroperoxide in 7400 TON.198e Murahashi and co-workers reported the oxidation of ethylbenzene using Fe powder, Fe(OAc)3, and FeCl3 in the presence of n-heptanal and acetic acid.198f Fe powder is found to be more effective, affording a mixture of phenylethanol and acetophenone in good conversion. A high-valent iron−oxo species is proposed as a key intermediate for this system.

8.4. Cobalt Catalysts
Cobalt catalysts have been extensively studied for the C−H oxidation of alkylbenzenes with molecular oxygen. The oxidation of alkylbenzenes with cobalt/bromine,199a CoCl2/diglyme,199b and cobalt with dipyridyl- and acetylacetone-functionalized polymers199c with molecular oxygen has been recently reviewed.1c Cobalt complex 56 has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of neat ethylbenzene to acetophenone in 70% conversion and 90% selectivity.200a Ishii and co-workers described the oxidation of alkylbenzenes by the combined use of Co(acac)n=2,3 and NHPI in acetic acid.200b-d The substrates having primary benzylic C−H bonds are oxidized to carboxylic acids, and secondary and tertiary C−H bonds are converted to a mixture of ketones and alcohols in quantitative yield (Scheme 76). Acetic and mandelic acid esters are oxidized to the corresponding α-ketoesters in quantitative yields (Scheme 77).201a Tsang and co-workers reported the oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid (>99% conversion and >99% selectivity) using the fluorous tag Co(II)/NaBr in a water and supercritical CO2 mixture,201b whereas Co/Mn/Br- (1:3:10) catalyzes the oxidation of p-cymene, p-methoxytoluene, and p-tert-butyltoluene in water−dioxane under air to provide a mixture of products in moderate conversion.201c

Scheme 77
8.5. Copper Catalysts
The copper-catalyzed benzylic oxidations operate in the presence as well absence of coreductants.
8.5.1. Reactions without Coreductants
Copper(II) chloride, in combination with acetoxime, has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of a methyl group in 2,4,6-trimethylphenol in alcohols at ambient temperature.202 Xu and co-workers reported the oxidation of p-cresol to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde with up to 95.6% selectivity at 98.5% conversion.203a This reaction has been performed in an autoclave in the presence of sodium hydroxide in methanol under molecular oxygen.
8.5.2. Reactions Involving Coreductants
The oxidation of ethylbenzene, indane, and tetraline has been performed with CuCl2−crown ether in the presence of acetaldehyde and molecular oxygen.195a These systems are efficient, and the corresponding alcohols and ketones are obtained in high TON (Table 13). The crown ether is believed to stabilize the oxometal intermediate by coordination and prevents its self-decomposition before hydrogen abstraction of hydrocarbons. A metal−oxo intermediate has been proposed as the key intermediate in these oxidations. The oxidation of indane to indanol (6%), indan-1-yl hydroperoxide (31%), and indanone (12%) is reported using copper salts, Cu(OH)2, CuCl2, and Cu(TPIP)2, in the presence of 2-methylpropanal and molecular oxygen (Scheme 78).203b There is no reaction in the presence of TEMPO, indicating that this system occurs via a radical pathway and not by a metal−oxo intermediate.

9. Aromatic C−H Oxidation
The aromatic C−H oxidation remains one of the most challenging problems in organic synthesis. The aromatic nucleus is resistant to oxidation because of its resonance stabilization, so oxygenation almost invariably requires a highly reactive oxidant under severe conditions.204 During recent years several studies have appeared using transition metal catalysts with molecular oxygen for the aromatic C−H oxidation. This section covers the aerobic oxygenation as well as the oxidative coupling of aromatic systems. The studies on the oxidation of benzene to phenol are summarized in Table 14.

9.1. Vanadium Catalysts
Vanadium-based catalysts have been studied for the hydroxylation as well as oxidative coupling of aromatic compounds.
9.1.1. Hydroxylation of Benzene Derivatives
Following the vanadium-catalyzed aerobic epoxidation of alkenes,10a Mukaiyama and co-workers reported the hydroxylation of substituted benzenes using VO(dpm)2 [dmp = 1,3-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-propanedionato] in the presence of crotonaldehyde and atmospheric oxygen (Scheme 79).205 Under these conditions, naphthalene is oxidized into 1,4-naphthaquinone without forming any phenolic compound. Shul'pin and co-workers carried out the oxidation of benzene to phenol using (n-Bu)4NVO3 in acetonitrile in the presence of solid ascorbic acid and with obligatory participation of pyridine, pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid, and acetic acid as mediators of proton and electron transfer.206a If some water is added to the system, the compound dissolves in aqueous acetonitrile and no hydroxylation occurs. The oxidation of naphthalene under the same reaction conditions gives isomeric naphthols (α/β = 4:1). Ascorbic acid can be replaced with zinc powder, and the zinc-based system hydroxylates not only benzene and aromatic ring methyl group in toluene (o/m/p = 47:28:25) but also C−H bonds in cyclohexane with the total TON being 78. The supported vanadium catalysts, V/SiO2 and V/TiO2, have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of benzene to phenol in 3.7% yield in the presence of zinc and molecular oxygen.206b In these reactions, some of the vanadium leaches into solution; this amount can be decreased by cosupporting Cu on the catalyst.
Scheme 79
9.1.2. Oxidative Coupling of 2-Naphthols
Optically active binaphthol (BINOL) and its derivatives are used as chiral auxiliaries and ligands in asymmetric synthesis and show an extremely high stereocontrol property in a wide range of asymmetric transformations.206c Few studies are focused on the synthesis of these compounds by enantioselective oxidative coupling using chiral oxovanadium(IV) complexes and molecular oxygen.206d,e The substrates containing an electron-donating group or unsubstituted 2-naphthol provide high enantioselectivity (Scheme 80).
Scheme 80
9.2. Rhenium Catalysts
Zeolite (H−ZSM-5) supported ReO4 has been investigated for the oxidation of benzene to phenol in the presence of molecular oxygen at 300 °C.207 In this reaction the presence of NH3 is indispensable for reducing and stabilizing the Re species efficiently.
9.3. Iron Catalysts
Iron catalysts have been studied for the aerobic hydroxylation of benzene derivatives at ambient temperature. The bimetallic iron complex 58 is catalyzed the oxidation of benzene to phenol in 11% yield in the presence of zinc powder.208a By this method toluene can be oxidized to a 2:5 mixture of o- and p-methylphenol in 8% yield (Scheme 81). The catalytic system consisting of FeCl2 and H3PW12O40 is catalyzed the hydroxylation of benzene in 27% yield in the presence of ;-ascorbic acid.208b

9.4. Ruthenium Catalysts
Ruthenium complexes catalyze the oxidative coupling of aromatic compounds with molecular oxygen. The oxidation of 2-naphthols to optically active BINOLs using chiral Ru−salen complex 59 is reported (Scheme 82).209a This reaction functions in the presence of light, and the substrate with a Br substituent has shown the highest enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). Milstein and co-workers carried out the oxidative coupling of aryl systems with alkenes in the presence of ruthenium salts and molecular oxygen.209b These reactions are effective in the presence of CO at high temperature (180 °C) under 2 atm of molecular oxygen. By this method, (E)-methyl cinnamate can be obtained in 41% yield (88 TON) from benzene and methyl acrylate.
Scheme 82
9.5. Cobalt Catalysts
The oxidative coupling of phenol to diphenoquinones is reported with layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported Co−phthalocyanines and molecular oxygen.210 The intercalation in the LDH stabilizes the catalyst against self-destruction. Whereas only 25 TON can be achieved in solution, the LDH-supported species remains stable after >3200 TON.
9.6. Palladium Catalysts
Palladium complexes catalyze efficiently the hydroxylation as well as oxidative coupling of aromatic compounds.
9.6.1. Hydroxylation of Benzene
The palladium-catalyzed hydroxylation reactions are focused on the oxidation of benzene to phenol. Pd(OAc)2−phenanthroline is used for the oxidation of benzene to phenol in the presence of molecular oxygen and CO.211a,b The solid-supported palladium catalysts Pd/Ts-1211c and Pd−Nafion/SiO2 composite211d and palladium membrane211e catalyze the oxidation of benzene to phenol under oxygen and hydrogen atmosphere. The reaction using palladium membrane shows the best result, 13.3% conversion and 85.5% selectivity. It uses a shell-and-tube reactor, in which a gaseous mixture of benzene and oxygen is fed into a porous alumina tube coated with a palladium thin layer and hydrogen is fed into the shell. Hydrogen dissociated on the palladium layer surface permeates onto the back and reacts with oxygen to give active oxygen species, which attack benzene to produce phenol.
9.6.2. Oxidative Coupling Reactions
The oxidative coupling of benzene to biphenyl catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 is reported in 3.4% conversion and 88% selectivity in the presence of a molybdenum cocatalyst.212a Ishii and co-workers described the oxidative coupling of benzene with alkenes bearing an electron-withdrawing groups using Pd(OAc)2 and polyoxometalate, HPMoV.212b This catalytic system can be extended to the coupling reactions between various substituted benzenes and alkenes. Jacobs and co-workers showed a high catalytic activity (up to 762 TON) in the reaction between benzene derivatives and electron-deficient alkenes using Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of PhCOOH.212c Ferreira and Stoltz described the intramolecular cyclization of homoallyl indole using Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of substituted pyridine (Scheme 83).212d The nature of the pyridine derivative and palladium source has a considerable effect on the catalysis.
Scheme 83
9.7. Platinum Catalysts
Platinum catalysts have been investigated for the hydroxylation of benzene under oxygen and hydrogen atmosphere. Benzene is oxidized to phenol selectively without forming any carbon oxides on supported platinum catalyst with V2O5 or Pd cocatalyst.213 The reaction proceeds both in liquid phase in the presence of acetic acid at 20−60 °C and in gas phase at elevated temperature. Although sufficient yield for industrial production of phenol is obtained, still the consumption of hydrogen gas is not satisfactory in these reactions. The efficiency of oxygen to form phenol is 30−40%, implying that 7−8 mol of hydrogen is consumed to form 1 mol of phenol. Nevertheless, the reductive activation of oxygen is expected to develop new industrial oxidation process for future technology.
9.8. Copper Catalysts
Copper complexes have been studied for the hydroxylation of benzene, the oxidation of phenol to 1,4-quinone, and the oxidative coupling of benzene derivatives.
9.8.1. Oxidation of Benzene Derivatives
Copper(I) chloride promotes the oxidation of benzene to phenol with molecular oxygen.214 The active species is proposed to be a hydroxy radical generated as shown in Scheme 84, but the reaction proceeds catalytically when Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) by molecular hydrogen in the presence of a palladium cocatalyst (Scheme 85). Tsuruya and co-workers reported the liquid phase oxidation of benzene to phenol, with molecular oxygen and Cu−zeolite or Cu−MCM as the catalyst.215a-c However, phenol yields are low, a large amount of supported Cu is required, and ascorbic acid is used as a stoichiometric coreductant. Phenol production is accompanied by the formation of H2O2 in solution. Sun and co-workers carried out the oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol to trimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (86% yield).215d This reaction is reported in ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, using copper(II) chloride and molecular oxygen.
Scheme 84
Scheme 85
9.8.2. Oxidative Coupling Reactions
Few studies have focused on the oxidative coupling of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol to 3,3‘,5,5‘-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4‘-diphenoquinone using Cu−Mg−Al hydrotalcite216a and Cu-exchanged MCM-41216b,c catalysts under molecular oxygen. In the presence of chiral amines 47 and 60, CuCl is catalyzed the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol to give optically active BINOL in good enantioselectivity (Scheme 86).216d,e The substrate with an ester moiety at the 3-position has shown the highest enantioselectivity (<78% ee).
Scheme 86
10. Baeyer−Villiger Oxidation
Baeyer−Villiger oxidation is a frequently used synthetic tool for the conversion of cycloalkanones to lactones. Usually, this transformation is carried out by peroxy compounds such as peracids217 and ROOH.218 Acids, bases, enzymes, and metal-containing reagents are known to catalyze Baeyer−Villiger oxidation.219 This section covers the recent studies of the aerobic Baeyer−Villiger oxidation catalyzed by transition metal salts.
10.1. Manganese and Cobalt Catalysts
Manganese and cobalt aluminophosphates, MAlPO (M = Mn and Co), have been investigated for the Baeyer−Villiger oxidation of ketones in the presence of benzaldehyde and molecular oxygen.220 The oxidation of cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone, and adamantan-2-one is performed in high yields (Table 15). After calcination at 550 °C, the recovered catalysts can be recycled without significant loss in catalytic activity.

10.2. Iron Catalysts
Murahashi and co-workers accomplished the oxidation of ketones to lactones with Fe2O3 in the presence of benzaldehyde and molecular oxygen in 56−98% yields.221 This reaction provides a convenient method for the synthesis of 4-acyloxy β-lactams, which are key intermediates for the synthesis of thienamycin and 1-methylcarbapenems. For example, 4-benzoyl lactam 61 has been oxidized to 4-benzoyloxy β-lactam 62 with complete retention of configuration in 93% yield (Scheme 87). These oxidations can be rationalized by assuming two pathways as shown in Scheme 88. The reaction of the aldehyde a with molecular oxygen and catalyst would give acylperoxy radical b, which is a key intermediate of autoxidation of aldehyde. The radical abstracts hydrogen from aldehyde to give peracid c, which undergoes facile reaction with ketone to give d. Alternatively, the radical reacts with ketone and subsequently with an aldehyde to give e. The intermediate thus formed would undergo rearrangement to give ester f and carboxylic acid.

Scheme 88
10.3. Nickel Catalysts
Soon after the discovery of the aerobic epoxidation of alkenes by the combined use of metal complex, aliphatic aldehyde, and molecular oxygen, Mukaiyama and co-workers reported the aerobic Baeyer−Villiger oxidation of cyclic and linear ketones.222 These reactions have been performed with Ni(dpm)2 in the presence of isovaleraldehyde at ambient conditions (Scheme 89).
Scheme 89
10.4. Copper Catalysts
Bolm and co-workers reported the enantioselective Baeyer−Villiger oxidation of cyclic ketones using copper complex 63 in the presence of pivalaldehyde and molecular oxygen.223 In the presence of 1 mol % of 63, racemic 2-phenylcyclohexanone is oxidized to optically active lactone in 41% yield with up to 69% ee, and the unreacted ketone shows S configuration (Scheme 90). The best result is observed in benzene solutions at ambient temperature. Chiral cyclobutanone derivatives are oxidized with up to 95% ee (Scheme 91).223 With respect to cyclohexanones, the scope of this reaction remains limited, and only 2-aryl-substituted compounds are reactive enough to give the corresponding optically active lactones. Prochiral cyclobutanones also give optically active lactones; the enantioselectivity in this process, however, is only moderate (up to 44% ee). The only exception observed is the oxidation of Kelly et al.'s tricyclic ketone, which has afforded lactone 64 in 91% ee.223b,f
Scheme 90
Scheme 91
11. Sulfoxidation
The oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides has been extensively studied due to the importance of sulfoxides as useful intermediates in organic synthesis, and some of them play key roles in the activation of enzymes.224 Many oxidants are available to perform this key transformation.225 This section covers the transition metal catalyzed aerobic oxidation of sulfides.
11.1. Vanadium and Molybdenum Catalysts
Haimov and Neumann studied the oxidation of sulfides using a polyoxometalate, H5PV2Mo10O40, and molecular oxygen in poly(ethylene glycol) at 115 °C.76e Tetrahydrothiophene, diphenyl sulfide, dibutyl sulfide, and thioanisole are oxidized to a mixture of the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones in 33−82% conversion.
11.2. Manganese Catalysts
Enantioselective sulfoxidation of aryl alkyl sulfides (44−95% ee) has been studied using chiral manganese complexes 9 and 13 in the presence of aliphatic aldehydes and molecular oxygen.226 The complexes 13 are more effective and catalyze the oxidation of a series of alkyl aryl sulfides with good enantioselectivity (Table 16). The reactivity profile of this sulfoxidation is similar to that of the enantioselective epoxidation of alkenes. For example, the ee of methyl o-bromophenyl sulfoxide is dependent on the nature of the aldehyde:  t-BuCHO, 52% ee; i-PrCHO, 46% ee; and n-PrCHO, 42% ee. The addition of N-alkylimidazole (NAI) is essential in these reactions as its absence leads to low chemical and optical yield of sulfoxide having the opposite enantioselectivity (Scheme 92).
Scheme 92

a Sulfide (0.125 mmol), pivalaldehyde (0.375 mmol), and 13 (0.0225 mmol) were stirred in m-xylene (5 mL) at 25 °C with 1 atm of O2 for 20 h.
11.3. Iron Catalysts
The iron catalysts have been shown to catalyze efficiently the sulfoxidation reaction with molecular oxygen. The oxidation of a series of sulfides has been studied using Fe(NO3)3−FeBr3, Fe(NO3)3−FeBr2, and Cu(NO3)2−CuBr2 under oxygen atmosphere.227 The binary system, Fe(NO3)3−FeBr3, is more active, catalyzing the oxidation of sulfides in high yields. Two types of active species may be considered in this process, either oxidation by NO2 or oxidation by the bromides/bromine couple controlled by Fe(III) (Scheme 93). Hill and co-workers reported that the silica nanoparticle supported polyoxometalate, {K8[FeIII(OH2)2)3(PW9O34)2]}58(Si/AlO2), catalyzes the oxidation of tetrahydrothiophene to tetrahydrothiophene oxide in high TON.228a This reaction takes place by autoxidation, and no sulfone is observed. Iron(III)−porphyrin complexes have been studied for the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide to give a mixture of the corresponding sulfoxide (610 TON) and sulfone (68 TON) under irradiation.228b Carson and Lippard described the oxidation of pyridylphenyl sulfide tethered to a carboxylate−diiron complex in the presence of molecular oxygen.228c
Scheme 93
11.4. Nickel Catalysts
Knochel and co-workers reported the oxidation of sulfides using a polyfluoroinated nickel complex in a fluorous biphase system (FBS).34c By this method, sulfides can be selectively converted to either sulfoxide or sulfone on the basis of the quantity of the coreductant, 2-methylpropanal. The fluorous phase having the catalyst can be recycled without of loss of activity.
12. Conclusions
The foregoing sections have clearly demonstrated the impressive progress made in the area of transition metal catalyzed aerobic epoxidation of alkenes. The methodologies described based on various epoxidation reactions have clearly opened new avenues for major growth in the area of epoxidation using molecular oxygen. The use of molecular oxygen as a source of oxygen atom and the formation of few neutral byproducts clearly make aerobic oxidation a highly desirable, economically viable, and environmentally acceptable reaction. The epoxidation reaction can be made more attractive if both of the oxygen atoms of the dioxygen can be transferred during the epoxide formation. These epoxidations can further be made environmentally viable by using catalyst anchored on polymer and carrying out the reaction in FBS. This review has also highlighted the remarkable progress made in Wacker oxidation. Clearly the oxidation of the carbon−carbon double bond to the corresponding carbonyl compounds is a highly desirable and rewarding industrial process. Similarly, the progress made in the area of C−H oxidation of alkanes is very impressive, and this will allow access to a rich feedstock for fine chemical industries. The Wacker oxidation and C−H oxidation of alkanes have been successfully performed with environmentally friendly catalysts that can be recycled. This aspect is going to be important for chemical industries from the point of view of environmental consideration. Although transition metal catalyzed allylic and benzylic oxidation have met with little success, the initial studies on this important chemical transformation are encouraging, and it holds a promising future for its application in the fine chemical industry. The limited success achieved during the transition metal catalyzed oxidation of benzene has paved the way for future exploration into this important chemical transformation. This transformation would have a profound impact on the polymer, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical industries. The transitional metal catalyzed aerobic oxidation of sulfides has been successfully achieved by manganese catalysts. This reaction promises to open new avenues for enantioselective synthesis of sulfoxides.
Finally, transition metal catalyzed oxidation of organic substrates with molecular oxygen is becoming an important and highly rewarding protocol for important feedstocks for fine chemical industries. Initial success in this area is promising and forecasts future growth in accessing oxidized organic molecules using molecular oxygen and transition metal catalysts. The efforts in this area will clearly culminate in tackling the major issues pertaining to environmentally acceptable technologies for future.
