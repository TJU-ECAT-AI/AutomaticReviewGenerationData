Many key transformations in heterogeneous catalysis 
involve the creation or modification of surface metal- 
hydrocarbyl (alkyl, aryl, etc.) functionalities. One at- 
tractive approach to characterizing such highly reactive 
species is to create them by adsorption of well-defined 
molecular precursors onto carefully prepared inorganic 
surfaces.’v2 For several classes of early transition metal 
hydrocarbyls, it has been known since the 1960s that 
adsorption on high surface area metal oxides is accom- 
panied by dramatic enhancements in activity for olefin 
transformations such as 
polymerization and metathe- 
s ~ s . ’ ~ ~ ~ ~  
The study of such materials is of both funda- 
mental scientific significance (What unique surface 
coordination environments give rise to such enhance- 
ments in chemical reactivity?) and technological in- 
terest (What clues are offered regarding the nature of 
highly efficient third-generation Ziegler-Natta olefin 
polymerization catalysts? Is it possible to “tailor” 
catalysts for improved chemo-, regio-, and stereoselec- 
tivity?). Despite these motivations and much empirical 
data, it is fair to say that our understanding of the 
overall surface coordination chemistry as well as the 
precise nature of the catalytically active sites has been 
at a very primitive level. 
The purpose of this Account is to review recent s u p  
ported metal hydrocarbyl research carried out at 
Northwestern University. The goal has been to build

Hence, the facility of oxidative addition/reductive 
elimination sequences, key transformations in transi- 
tion-metal organometallic 
chemistry, should be greatly 
different for catalytic centers derived from Th and U 
precursors. Furthermore, the unpaired 5f electrons of 
U(1V) provide a useful NMR spectroscopic probe. 
We begin with a discussion of inorganic supports as 
ligands, followed by a summary of organoactinide sur- 
face chemical and heterogeneous catalytic observations. 
While these results are informative in regard to the 
adsorption process and establishing high catalytic ac- 
tivity, they also illustrate the elusive character of surface 
adsorbate structural information in situations not 
readily addressed by contemporary surface photon/ 
particle absorption or scattering techniques. We then 
show how high-resolution 
solid-state 
NMR spectroscopy 
provides a definitive picture of adsorbate structure and 
reactivity as 
well as 
clues to developing functional ho- 
mogeneous model chemistry. Finally, we generalize 
these results to group 4 
surface and solution chemistry.

CH3 groups (B 
can also be assayed via methylene 
transfer reactivityg). That is, the majority of methyl 
groups remain bound to the surface in some way not 
revealed by these chemical experiments. Chemical 
probes such as H2 (or D2) reveal that an additional 
-10-20% of the methyl groups can be liberated by 
hydrogenolysis (eq 5). The virtually indistinguishable

and Cp’2U(CH3)2

experiments 
argues that change in metal oxidation state 
is not an important part of the adsorption chemistry. 
There is no evidence for significant Cp’H liberation. 
Although complexes such as 
Cp’2Th(CH3)2 
are mar- 
ginally active for olefin hydrogenation and ethylene 
polymerization in homogeneous solution,1° 
adsorption 
upon DA results in a dramatic enhancement in catalytic 
activity. With propylene hydrogenation as a probe 
reaction, kinetic experiments reveal catalytic activities 
comparable to those of heterogeneous platinum metal 
cataly~ts.~~Jl 
A common characteristic of heteroge- 
neous catalysts is that only a fraction of the surface sites 
are catalytically significant. For the Cp’2An(CH3)2/DA, 
quantitative poisoning studies using either CO, HzO, 
or CH3Cl 
as 
probes, reveal that stoichiometrically 
small 
amounts of these poisons (corresponding to -4% of 
available actinide sites) completely suppress catalytic 
activity. That i

only -4% of the Cp’2Th(CH3)2/DA 
sites sustain the bulk of the hydrogenation activity. 
These remarkable sites then have turnover frequencies

High-Resolution Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy 
of Adsorbed Metal Hydrocarbyls 
The precise structural characterization of hydro- 
carbyls adsorbed on irregular metal oxide and halide 
surfaces at less than monolayer coverage presents a 
challenge for most physical characterization methods. 
While NMR spectroscopy of adsorbed systems has 
traditionally been frustrated by internuclear dipolar 
coupling, unfavorable spin-lattice relaxation times, and 
(for many nuclei) large chemical shift anisotropies, 
high-resolution CPMAS (cross polarization with magic 
angle spinning) techniques have dramatically altered 
this picture. In the present case, the high surface areas 
of the supports enhance achievable adsorbate concen- 
trations. In addition, assignment aids such as 
isotopic 
labeling, model compounds, interrupted decoupling, 
variable magnetic fields, supports having quadrupolar 
nuclei, paramagnetic probes, and techniques to probe 
adsorbate mobility have proven invaluable. Of course, 
rigorously anhydrous and anaerobic sample handling 
techniques must be developed. 
The 13C CPMAS NMR spectra of Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/ 
DA and Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgClZ 
can be completely as- 
signed using the aforementioned methodology and lead 
to a remarkable conclusion: a methide anion has been 
transferred from the actinide center to a Lewis acid 
site on the surface (e.g., eq 8).17 Thus, A1-CH3 and 
Mg-CH3 resonances appear at characteristic field pos- 
itions, and the Th-13CH3 signal is shifted slightly

and are consistent with the aforementioned surface

The spectra of

and Cp3Th(13CH3)/DA 
can 
likewise be assigned “cation-like” 
structures J and K,17a 
respectively. Several experiments indicate that adsor- 
bate motion is not sufficiently rapid and isotropic to 
significantly average C-H dipolar interactions for any 
of the adsorbate species. 
Returning to G, an obvious structural analogy to the 
highly active lanthanide Cp’,MR catalysts E is evident. 
Moreover, the high electrophilicity attending cationic 
character would be expected to facilitate olefin insertion 
and alkyl hydrogenolysis (eqs 6 and 7).15 Questions 
remain regarding residual interactions between the 
actinide center and the transferred methyl group (is it 
a pCH3 complex such as L?) as well as the surface.

Since bridging alkyl groups are sometimes associated 
with special reactivity properties in mechanistic dis- 
cussions of Ziegler-Natta catalysis,’~~ 
the former ques- 
tion takes on particular significance. It is possible to 
probe the actinide*-CH3(surface) 
distances by making 
use of the large magnetic anisotropy 
based and unpaired 
spin density delocalization based chemical shift dis- 
placements that nuclei bound to paramagnetic f ions 
can undergo. For CP’~U(’~CH~),, 
the U-13CH3 signals

Clearly pCH3 
species are not a major part 
of this surface chemistry. The nature of the residual 
organoactinideaurface interaction in G (the surface is 
in actuality the charge-compensating counterion) is 
more problematic. It is likely that the irregular char- 
acter of the surface topology gives rise to a variety of 
sterically and electronically differing surface adsorption 
sites.7 T

explains broad adsorbate line shapes in the 
NMR spectrum, as well as support-dependent differ- 
ences in reactivity and percentage active sites. Models 
for these counterion effects will be taken up in the 
discussion of homogeneous models (vide infra). 
What does the surface spectroscopy teach us about 
adsorbate reactivity? Unfortunately, the catalytic 
poisoning derived percentage of CP’,T~(’~CH~)~/DA 
active sites is to small to directly observe transforma- 
tions at the adsorbate centers by NMR. For example, 
ethylene dosing of CP’,T~(~~CH~)~/DA 
produces large 
oligo/ polyethylene signals but undetectable alterations 
in the oragnometallic adsorbate features. In agreement 
with the catalytic 
poisoning experiments, 
the percentage 
of sites reacting with olefin is below the NMR detection 
limits. However, Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12, 
in which 40 
f 
10% of the sites are active for propylene hydrogen- 
ation, offers better prospects. Thus, the question of 
whether the site of ethylene insertion is at surface Th-

or Mg-l3CH3 functionalities or at both can be

addressed in competition studies. As illustrated in 
Scheme I, ethylene insertion converts the amplified 
(99% 13C) metal-CH, magnetization into that of an 
environment characteristic of an oligoethylene end- 
group. Hence, spectroscopic signatures of reactive 
moieties should be greatly attenuated, while those of 
“spectator” groups remain unchanged. The actual ex- 
periment is shown in Figure 2, where Cp’,Th- 
(13CH3)2/MgC12 
samples are dosed with ethylene at 77 
K (to allow ethylene diffusion into the catalyst pore 
structure prior to reaction) and then allowed to warm 
to room temperature. Only the Th-13CH3 
resonance is 
diminished by ethylene addition. Quantitative analysis 
of the NMR data as 
a function of ethylene dosage in- 
dicates that >90

10% 
of the ethylene insertions occur 
at the Th-13CH3 centers and that 50 f 
10% 
of the Th 
sites are reactive under the experimental conditions.

 Moreover, the Th-I3CH3 region of Figure

of surface hydroxyl groups). In competition with the

NMR probing of adsorbate reactivity is not restricted 
to ethylene insertion. Thus, other reagents (e.g., H2, 
CO, propylene) and spectroscopies 
(e.g., IH MAS) reveal 
a rich and intricate surface chemistry.17 For example,

Model Cationic Organoactinide Chemistry in 
Solution 
At the outset of this work (1984), little or no firm 
precedent existed for cationic species such as 
G in either 
conventional organoactinide or group 4 organometallic 
chemistry. Indeed, it was not clear whether such species 
could be prepared and, if so, whether they would exhibit 
the spectroscopic characteristics and extraordinary re- 
activity seen on the surfaces. Crucial design questions 
concern the selection of charge-compensating anion (X- 
in M) and the preparative route. Regarding the former,

ous in the former are the short Th-CH, and Th-Cri,, 
distances. The shortest Th-F contacts (Th-F(18),F-

Th4+

a Th-O(THF)

differences in F/O covalent radii (-2.56 A). The C-

distances are unexceptional 
and the valence 
angles about the B atom essentially 
tetrahedral. In the 
solution I9F NMR spectra, the C6F5 
groups are in fast 
exchange down to -70 “C. 
These results provide a compelling argument that 
G-type cation-like 
species are indeed formed on Lewis 
acidic surfaces by methide abstraction and that such 
species can exhibit high catalytic activity. Equally in- 
structive is the finding that the reactivity of such cat- 
ions exhibits a very large sensitivity to the nature of the 
charge-compensating anion, 
which is entirely consistent 
with the support-modulated 
adsorbate 
reactivity effects 
observed in the heterogeneous systems. 
Group 4 Organometallic Surface Chemistry, 
Catalysis, and Spectroscopy 
The foregoing discussion raises the question of 
whether such results are generalizable to the early 
transition metals, which form the basis for most cur- 
rent-generation olefin polymerization catalysts. Ad- 
sorption studies of CP,Z~(CH~)~, 
Cp’,Zr(CH3),, and 
CP’Z~(CH~)~ 
have been carried out on alumina.31 In 
general, evolved CHI yields on DA are comparable to 
those observed for Cp’,Th(CH,),/DA; however, CH4 
yields for adsorption on PDA are comparatively less. 
The explanation logically resides in the lower proto- 
nolytic reactivity and presumably lower polar character 
of Zr-alkyl bonds.3z 
In regard to heterogeneous catalysis, the order of 
activity for propylene hydrogenation and ethylene po- 
lymerization on DA again roughly parallels the coor- 
dinative unsaturation of the precatalyst: 
CP’Z~(CH~)~ 
> Cp2Zr(CH3), 
> Cp’zZr(CH3)2 
Nt for Cp,Zr(CH3),/DA-catalyzed propylene hydro- 
genation is -30% of that for Cp’,Th(CH3),/DA. 
Poisoning experiments with CO indicate that -4% of 
CpzZr(CH3)z/DA 
and -12% of CP’Z~(CH~)~/DA 
sur- 
face sites are of catalytic significance. In marked con- 
trast to the results for supported organoactinides, the 
above organozirconium complexes on PDA also exhibit 
significant activity for propylene hydrogenation: ca. 
30% of that observed on DA. These results suggest 
strong parallels between the chemical properties of 
supported organo group 4 and organoactinide com- 
plexes, with a major divergence being the behavior on 
the partially hydroxylated support.

to be insignif- 
icant. The NMR data show that the adsorption of 
CP,Z~(’~CH~)~ 
on DA proceeds analogously to that of 
Cp’,Th(13CH3), (eq 12). At the time of the first ex-

C5H5 
and Zr-13CH3) were modeled reasonably well by 
those of known, base-coordinated cationic complexes 
of the type Cp2Zr(CH3)L+B(C6H5)4-.33 
In agreement 
with the catalytic findings, the CPMAS spectra of 
CP,Z~(’~CH~)~/PDA 
show the presence of both pox0 
species (e.g., P) and cations (0). Thus, zirconocene

alkyl cations can also form on partially hydroxylated 
Lewis acidic surfaces, 
explaining 
the catalytic activities 
on such supports reported by other  researcher^?^ and 
further strengthening the contention that Cp2ZrR+ 
adsorbate complexes are the catalytically 
active centers. 
Moreover, the observation of Lewis acid-promoted 
formation of cationic species accompanied by high ac- 
tivities for olefin hydrogenation and ethylene polym- 
erization bears directly upon an important, unresolved 
issue in homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysis. 
Model Cationic Organozirconium Chemistry in 
Solution 
In addition to affording a better understanding of 
cationic adsorbate species (O), the synthesis of stable, 
base-free, highly electrophilic Cp2ZrR+X- 
complexes 
would offer models for several classes of important yet 
poorly understood, soluble olefin polymerization cata- 
lysts. Indirect evidence argues that catalysts prepared 
from metallocene dialkyls and large excesses of Lewis 
acid cocatalysts such as methylalumoxane (“+Ah 
(CH3)0+n”)3934 
are in fact Cp2ZrR+ 
If 
this is true, such chemistry would represent a direct 
parallel to the aforementioned organo group 4 surface 
chemistry. 
Solution-phase models of eq 12 must conform to 
many of the guidelines set forth for Cp’,ThR+X- com-

NMR spectroscopy can be employed to probe B-CH3 
bond lability and the tightness of the ion pairing in 2b, 
since symmetrizing processes which are fast on the 
NMR time scale can be readily detected. We find that 
reorganization of the ion pair structures occurs slightly 
more rapidly (--5X) than transposition of the triaryl- 
borane coordination. The barriers to both processes are 
appreciable (AG* 
= 19 kcal/mol).

Concluding Remarks 
This research has shown that strong parallels can be 
drawn between the surface organometallic chemistry 
and catalytic properties of adsorbed actinide/group 4 
hydrocarbyls and certain classes of solution-phase 
molecules. CPMAS NMR spectroscopy shows that 
alkyl anion abstraction constitutes a major adsorptive 
pathway on dehydroxylated Lewis acidic supports. The 
resulting cation-like species are highly active hetero-

for olefin hydrogenation and ethylene 
polymerization. The catalytic behavior is a strong 
function of the nature of the charge-compensating 
support material and likely the local surface topology. 
On hydroxylated supports, p-oxo adsorbate species are 
formed which are catalytically inactive. Using solu- 
tion-phase protonolytic or organo Lewis acid abstractive 
approaches, it is possible to synthesize crystallograph- 
ically characterizable, cation-like spectroscopic, struc-

tural, and functional models for the aforementioned 
adsorbate species. The reactivity of these ion pairs is 
strongly dependent upon the coordinative properties 
of the charge-compensating anion, in agreement with 
the support sensitivities seen in the heterogeneous 
systems. The most loosely connected ion pairs are ex- 
tremely reactive, with catalytic activities approaching 
those of the supported catalysts. Moreover, the soluble 
group 4 complexes can serve as 
stoichiometrically pre- 
cise models for several important classes of alumox- 
me-based olefin polymerization catalysts. These results 
show that exciting opportunities exist where heteroge- 
neous catalysis can teach us new things about homo- 
geneous catalysis and vice versa. The challenge lies in 
building bridges between the two areas using the ap- 
propriate physicochemical techniques and synthetic 
strategies.

generous support of the U.S. Department of 
Energy under Grant

Chemistry is the world of molecules, and within this 
world the chemical reaction is one of the most impor- 
tant parts, if not the most important. How molecules 
decay and how they react with other molecules on a 
microscopic basis is of most interest to the chemist.l 
The understanding of chemical reactions requires, 
however, a very detailed knowledge of the molecular 
electronic structure, for even its smallest features can 
have a decisive influence on the dynamics of such 
complex systems as 
molecules. The exploration of the 
atomic and molecular electronic structure has benefited 
greatly from high-resolution spectroscopy, which has 
progressed considerably since the advent of the laser 
by taking advantage of the unique laser properties such 
as monochromaticity, high intensity, and extremely 
short pulses. The rapid development of the laser has 
produced state-of-the-art 
systems whose characteristics 
are close to the limits imposed by physical laws. With 
respect to the frequency domain, continuous-wave lasers 
nowadays feature bandwidths well below 1 kHz 
whereas, with respect to the time domain, pulses as 
short as 6 fs have been successfully generated. So it 
seems that narrow-band laser radiation should allow 
spectroscopists to resolve spectra of molecules in the 
gas phase to nearly any desired extent while the ex- 
tremely short pulses may be used to reveal the dynam- 
ics of atomic motion in a molecule. This remarkable 
Herbert Bitto was born in Hakluclca. Yugoslavia, on June 13, 1954 and 
received his Pd.D. from the University of Zhich (1984). He spent two years 
as a NATO postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Since 1986 he has been Research Associate at the Unlversity of Zurich and 
head of the computer-assisted experimentation facility of the Institute of 
Physical Chemistry. His interests in research as well as in music include 
everything that has “rhythm and beat”. 
J. Robert Huber was t” 
in Zurich, Switzerland, on October 29, 1934 and 
received his Ph.0. (1966) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 
(ETH) in Zurich. He 
was a postdoctoral fellow with the US Army Pioneering 
Research Labs In Natick, MA, and then joined the faculty at Northeastern 
University in Boston. In 1973 he became Professor of Chemistry at the 
University of Konstanz, Germany, and in 1979 assumed his current position 
as chaired Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Zurich. His 
research centers on molecular dynamics, laser spectroscopy, and photc- 
chemistry.

radiation of “purest color” is available, and even this 
is tunable. However, it is not the light source that limits 
the resolution but the simple fact that the motion of 
the freely moving gas molecules causes line broadening 
in the spectra due to the Doppler effect. 
Several spectroscopic methods have been developed 
to overcome Doppler broadening, for example, nonlin- 
ear techniques such as 
saturation spectroscopy, polar- 
ization spectroscopy, or two-photon spectroscopy with 
counterpropagating laser beams, as well as simple re- 
duction of the molecules’ velocity spread in molecular 
beams. Another method, conceptually very funda- 
mental and experimentally relatively inexpensive, is 
based on the quantum beat phenomenon. Quantum 
beats appear as oscillations superimposed on the 
time-resolved 
fluorescence after a laser pulse has excited 
within its energy uncertainty two or more states in an 
atom or molecule. The frequencies of the quantum 
beats are just the energy differences between the 
“coherently” excited states. 
This effect, lying at the heart of quantum mechanics, 
was introduced to atomic spectroscopy by Alexandrov 
and by Dodd and co-workers 
in 1964, but only with the 
introduction of the pulsed laser have quantum beats 
become interesting for a spectroscopic 
applicatioa2 It 
is the aim of this Account to give a short and simple 
description of just this phenomenon and to show how 
it is utilized as a high-resolution, molecular spectro- 
scopic technique in the time domain, going far beyond 
rotational res~lution.~-~ 
The power and versatility of 
quantum beat spectroscopy will then be demonstrated
