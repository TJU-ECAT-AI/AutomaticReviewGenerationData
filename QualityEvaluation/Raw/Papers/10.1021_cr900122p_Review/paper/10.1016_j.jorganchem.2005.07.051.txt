Abstract
Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) is immobilized on various commercially available supporting materials by sublimation under
vacuum. Up to 15 wt% MTO (10 wt% Re) can be immobilized on the diﬀerent supporting materials. Metathesis experiments with
cis-cyclooctene as substrate are performed aiming at a high yield of low molecular weight metathesis products (dimers, trimers,
tetramers), which are interesting for aroma and ﬂavour industries. Up to ca. 60% of these desired products can be obtained. A high
rhenium loading leads usually to good catalytic activities of the materials in the cyclooctene metathesis. Prolonged reaction times
lead to higher yields of the high molecular weight metathesis products. When the same catalyst material is used repeatedly in several
catalytic runs, leaching of the grafted Re compounds plays an increasing role, resulting in a reduction of the catalyst performance.
None of the examined commercially available carrier materials, however, presents an ideal means for the heterogenization of MTO
to obtain particularly high amounts of the desired low molecular weight metathesis products of cyclooctene.

1. Introduction
Since the 1980s several research groups [1–17] deve-
loped homogeneous systems usable as highly active
W-, Mo- and Ru-based catalysts for metathesis. Some
of these catalysts were successfully immobilized on poly-
styrene [18]. The most active heterogeneous metathesis
catalysts known to date are based on the elements
rhenium, molybdenum and tungsten [19].
The system Re2O7/Al2O3 is an eﬀective heteroge-
neous catalyst for carrying out oleﬁn metathesis under
mild conditions and its activity can be further increased
by the addition of tetraalkyl tin compounds [20–23].
This observation led to the methyl tin based synthesis
of methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) [24]. Since tin contain-
ing co-catalysts are essential for the metathesis of
functionalized oleﬁns [25,26], it was soon discovered
that MTO supported on acidic metal oxides forms
metathesis catalysts that are active without additives,
even for functionalized oleﬁns [27]. Standard supports
are Al2O3-SiO2, or Nb2O5 and the activity was reported
to be related to the surface acidity [19,28–30]. A high
metathesis activity was observed when MTO is chemi-
sorbed on the surface. Evidence for a surface carbene
species was found to be somewhat controversial, but
there appeared to be a correlation between the catalytic
activity and the presence of alkyl fragments on the
surface [27–29,31]. It has been shown later, however,
that matrix-isolated MTO tautomerizes to H2C@Re-
(OH)O2 under the inﬂuence of UV light; the carbene
has been characterized in its normal, D- and 13C-enri-
ched isotopic forms by IR spectroscopy with results

in good agreement with quantum chemical calculations
[32]. DFT calculations indicate that H2C@Re(OH)O2
lies nearly 90 kJ/mol higher in energy than MTO, and
hence is inaccessible under normal thermal conditions.
Using the complex CH3ReO2{(g2-OSiH2)2O} as a mod-
el, i.e., the condensation product of MTO with disilanol,
{H2Si(OH)}2O, shows that the tautomeric H-atom
transfer occurs preferentially to an Re–O–Si bridging
oxygen rather than to an Re@O unit. The resulting car-
bene species, H2C@ Re{(g2-OSiH2)(O)(SiH2OH)}, is
eﬀectively stabilized by nearly 50 kJ/mol relative to
CH3ReO2-{(g2-OSiH2)2O}. This alternative
H-atom
transfer to the Re–O–Si bridge appears to be a more
plausible mechanism for carbene formation on the sup-
porting materials [32,33]. A surface compound of similar
composition is considered to be a plausible candidate for
the catalytic active species in heterogeneous MTO cata-
lyzed metathesis reactions by some researchers (see
Scheme 1) [32–36]. Isolated and fully characterized
Rhenium carbene complexes featuring Re in high oxida-
tion states and displaying also oxo ligands attached to
the rhenium carbene moiety are, however, still quite rare
[37–40]. Nevertheless, the application of MTO as hete-
rogeneous metathesis catalyst is of signiﬁcant interest,
due to the very easy synthetic accessibility and the
usually high stability of this organometallic compound
[41,42].
C15–20-bodies of cyclic and unsaturated hydrocar-
bons are used in high quantities in aroma and ﬂavour
industry. Such substances can be synthesized by meta-
thetic dimerization of cis-cyclooctene
with
Re2O7/
Al2O3 catalysts pre-activated with tin compounds.
However, besides the lower weight metathesis products
considerable amounts of products, consisting of ﬁve
and more cyclooctene units are often obtained as
by-products (see Scheme 2) [43,44]. In this work, we
examine the application of supported MTO as catalyst
without pre-activation to compare the product yields
with the Re2O7/Al2O3 catalyst system. We apply dif-
ferent commercially available carriers in order to ﬁnd
out whether some of these systems could be utilized as
carrier materials for heterogeneous MTO without fur-
ther modiﬁcations and may be applied in the cyclooc-
tene metathesis.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Supporting materials and catalyst loading
For our examinations, we tested primarily commer-
cially available supporting materials with well-deﬁned
surface areas (BET) and pore volumes (see Table 1).
MTO, being a highly volatile, easily sublimable solid
can be brought on the supporting material by sublima-
tion under vacuum. Excess MTO, which does not under-
go a reaction with the surface –OH groups is removed
from the surface under vacuum. The supporting material
has to be thermally pre-treated in order to reduce the
decomposition of the immobilized and easy hydrolysable
rhenium species [35].
In the immobilization experiments an excess of MTO
(15 wt% with respect to the supporting material) has
been used to reach a maximum Re loading of the respec-
tive supporting materials. The rhenium content of the
product materials was determined by elementary analysis
(EA). A high quantity of molybdenum in the supporting
material 9 prevents the rhenium content determination
by elementary analysis. The rhenium content is in this
case calculated from the amount of resublimated MTO
after immobilization. This method has proven to be a
reliable method to determine the Re content also in cases
where no molybdenum is present and the Re content of
the layer can be independently determined by EA. The
extremely low Re loading in the cases of 9, 10 and 13
originates from the low speciﬁc surface area (BET) <
5 m2/g and the few surface hydroxyl groups available
for reaction (29Si CP-MAS-NMR evidence).
The resulting Re/C ratio being approximately 1:1 in
most examined cases shows that MTO decomposition
during the immobilization process is not pronounced
in most cases. This was already demonstrated previously
in quantitative experiments [27]. Only for samples 1 and
3 signiﬁcant decomposition is observed. During the
immobilization of MTO on SiO2/Al2O3the formation
of methane, ethane and ethene resulting from the
decomposition of MTO was monitored by GC–MS.
The decomposition of MTO observed during the immo-
bilization process was <5% in all examined cases [27],
with the exception of 1 and 3, where it was signiﬁcantly
higher. MTO without any co-catalyst in homogeneous
phase, however, is also not an active metathesis catalyst
with cyclooctene being the substrate.
2.2. Results of the metathesis experiments
2.2.1. Batch experiments
In order to test the activity of the prepared heteroge-
neous catalyst systems, metathesis experiments with
0.15–0.17 mol%
Re,
with
respect
to
the
substrate
cyclooctene, at 50 C were performed with n-hexane
being the solvent (Scheme 1). The results of the catalysis
experiments are summarized in Table 2. None of the
supporting materials catalyzed the cyclooctene metathe-
sis under the applied conditions when no MTO was
grafted on it prior to application.
Aiming at a high yield of lower homologues, which
are used in aroma and ﬂavour industry no highly active
metathesis catalyst is needed. Such catalysts produce
rapidly a quite large amount of higher homologues
due to their fast conversion of the starting material. A
catalyst with lower activity and conversion gains a high-
er yield of lower homologues.
Material 2 having a higher MTO loading, a higher
speciﬁc surface area and a higher pore volume than
material 1 is a good metathesis catalyst, particularly

with respect to forming the lower molecular weight
products. Materials 1, 9, 10 and 13 display no metathesis
activity.
The comparatively low Re loading of these materials
seems not to be suﬃcient to obtain metathesis activity.
A larger content of heavier metathesis products is
observed with material 3. Materials 2, 4–8, 11, and 12,
having all a Re loading between 7.5% and 10% display
a comparable metathesis activity. In all these cases the
amount of the desired lower weight metathesis products
is somewhat higher than the amount of the heavier
metathesis products.
Some of the catalysts leading to the favoured reaction
products were tested at a lower reaction temperature
(20 C), in order to see whether this would additionally
contribute to a higher amount of lower molecular
weight metathesis products (see Table 3). The observed
amounts, however, were in most cases quite similar to
those listed in Table 2 (50 C reaction temperature).
2.2.2. Time-dependent experiments
Time-dependent metathesis experiments were perfor-
med in a tubular reactor in order to evaluate the long
time eﬀect on selectivity and catalytic activity. In the
tubular reactor unit, the reaction medium was circulated
(ﬂow rate 5 mL/min. The results are shown in Table 4).
The product distribution is similar to the batch expe-
riments. The conversion is completed after 7 h. If the
reaction is continued, the dimer concentration decreases
and the concentration of the higher homologs increases
slowly. The higher viscous components of the reaction
mixture, however, cause technical problems. After 2
days the reaction medium is so viscous that the ﬂow rate
has to be increased. In consequence the contact time
changes and the steady state model can not be applied
any more.
2.3. Leaching-experiments
An important parameter in heterogeneous reactions
is the stability of the heterogeneous catalyst. It can be
determined by leaching tests. Catalyst 3 was reﬂuxed
with the reaction mixture at 50 C for 24 h. Then the
solution was ﬁltered oﬀ, the catalyst was washed and
new substrate was added. Two further cycles were
performed. After three cycles 4 wt% Re were detected
by EA to remain on the supporting material. This
amount is approximated half of original Re content.
The product yield decreases from nearly quantitative
(ﬁrst cycle) to 63% (second cycle) to 10% (third cycle).
No free MTO was detectable by NMR in the con-
centrated washing solution. A deactivation process,
removing the Re compound from the surface leads to
perrhenates (EA evidence) and the formation of meth-
ane, ethane, etc.
Another deactivation process of the heterogeneous
catalyst occurs if wet solvent is present. Water promotes
the catalyst deactivation by leading to the formation of
free MTO (inactive in oleﬁn metathesis), which can be
detected by NMR and IR spectroscopy and perrhenic

acid as decomposition product. If 17O-labelled water is
added, the labelled oxygen is included both into the
formed MTO and into the perrhenic acid. This reaction
may be explained by an inversion of the catalyst forma-
tion reaction (see Scheme 1).
3. Conclusions
Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) can be heterogenized
by simple sublimation on several commercially available
supporting materials. A quite high Re loading of ca.
10 wt% can be reached with some of these materials.
All materials containing a reasonable Re loading main-
tain cyclooctene metathesis without any additives. The
amount of lower weight metathesis products (consisting
of less than four cyclooctene units), which are interesting
for the aroma and ﬂavour industry are obtained at room
temperature and 50 C in ca. 50–60% yield after 24 h
reaction time. Longer reaction times lead to a slow
increase of the content of higher homologues. During
several runs the catalyst materials loose Re due to
catalyst decomposition. This leads to a considerable
reduction of the metathesis activity. A hypothetical reac-
tion mechanism, based on previously published examin-
ations is shown in Scheme 3. This mechanism might help
to explain the observed water sensitivity of the heteroge-
neous systems, however, further work will be necessary
to elucidate the real mechanism of such reactions.
Further work in this direction is currently under way
in our laboratory.
The obtained results show that despite of some diﬀe-
rences in the obtained yields of the desired lower mole-
cular weight products, none of the yet commercially
available carrier materials presents an ideal supporting
system for MTO to be applied in the catalytic cyclooc-
tene metathesis.
4. Experimental
4.1. General procedures
All experiments were carried out under argon atmo-
sphere using glove box and Schlenk technique. All
solvents were dried and distilled under argon with the
standard methods. Nitrogen gas was deoxygenated by
a BTS-catalyst and dehydrated by molecular sieves
(4 A
˚ ) prior to use.
NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance
DPX-400. 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 400.13
MHz,
13C NMR spectra at 100.85 MHz.
29Si-CP-
MAS-NMR spectra are recorded at 79.49 MHz, with a
(9.4 T) Bruker MSL 400P spectrometer, with 5.5 ls 1H
90 pulses, 8 ms contact time, a spinning rate of
4.5 kHz and 4 s recycle delays. The molar mass distribu-
tion of the metathesis products was obtained by GPC.
The solvent in the samples of the reaction mixture were
distilled oﬀand replaced by CHCl3 for the measure-
ments. The determination was performed at a Hewlett-
Packard HP series 110 gel permeation chromatograph
with two polystyrene cross-linked columns (103 and 105
A
˚ ), refraction index detectors and UV-detectors. The
support morphology was obtained by the BET-method
on an AS AP 2010 nitrogen sorptionporosimeter (Micro-
meritics).

at 400 C for 12 h in a nitrogen ﬂow in order to obtain
dehydrated silica. All other supporting materials were
heated at 200 C for 3 h in a nitrogen ﬂow.
4.2.2. Immobilization of MTO on the supporting material
After dehydration MTO was added to the supporting
material under argon atmosphere. The ﬂask was closed
and cooled with liquid nitrogen to avoid the loss of
MTO during the evacuation. MTO was sublimated on
the support under vacuum. To get evenly distributed
sublimation the ﬂask was regularly shaken. After 24 h
reaction time a pre-weighed and liquid nitrogen cooled
cold trap was installed between the ﬂask and the vacuum
line and the excess of MTO was removed within 5 h. The
immobilized amount of MTO was calculated from the
amount of removed MTO and determined by Re
elemental analysis. The resulting solid with immobilized
rhenium was used as metathesis catalyst.
4.3. Metathesis experiments
Twelve millilitre of a 0.1 M cis-cyclooctene/n-hexane
solution were added to 300 mg catalyst under argon
atmosphere. The mixture was stirred, as indicated, for
24 h at 50 C or room temperature. After this samples
for analysis were taken. Depending on the Re content
of the catalyst the reactions were performed with a
0.15–0.17 mol% ratio of immobilisized rhenium:cyclo-
octene.
Time-dependent metathesis experiments were done in
a tubular reactor (Scheme 4) 500 mL 0.1 M cis-cyclooc-
tene/n-hexane solution were ﬁlled in a storage vessel
and catalyst 2 (9.6 g, 1.3 mol% [Re]) in the tubular

of the pump was 5 mL/min. Samples were taken after
7, 24 and 48 h.
4.4. Leaching-experiments with the immobilisized MTO
systems
Three hundred milligram of catalyst 3 were added to
12 mL 0.1 M cis-cyclooctene/n-hexane solution under
argon atmosphere. The mixture was reﬂuxed at 50 C
for 3 days. After each 24 h a sample was taken, the cat-
alyst was ﬁltered, washed three times with 10 mL hexane
and new substrate was added. Two further cycles were
performed. Then the catalyst was ﬁltered, washed, dried
under vacuum and the Re content of the material was
determined by elementary analysis.
