Review
Vî—¸Sb-oxide catalysts for the ammoxidation of propane
Abstract
V-Sb-oxide catalysts are claimed in several patents as the active components for a new process of direct acrylonitrile synthesis from propane. In this review the main catalytic, kinetic and mechanistic features of these catalysts are discussed with reference to the role of vanadium as the key component. Specific topics discussed include: (i) nature of the phases present in V-Sb-oxide catalysts, their modification during the catalytic reaction and nature of the non-stoichiometry of vanadium antimonate, (ii) catalytic and kinetic behavior as well as some specific aspects which characterize their reactivity, (iii) structure-activity and selectivity relationships, and (iv) reaction mechanism, influence on the surface reactivity of chemisorbed species (ammonia, in particular) and presence of competitive pathways of transformation.
