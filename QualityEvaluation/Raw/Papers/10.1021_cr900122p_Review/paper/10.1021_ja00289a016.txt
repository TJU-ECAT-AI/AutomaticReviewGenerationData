Abstract: This contribution reports a detailed, quantitative investigation of surface chemistry and catalysis involving selected 
organoactinides and partially dehydroxylated (PDA) or dehydroxylated (DA) alumina supports. For the complexes Cp’,M(CH,), 
and Cp’,M(CD,), 
(Cp’ = $-(CH,),C,; 
M = Th, U), methane-evolving surface reaction pathways are identified as M-CH3 
protonolysis via surface OH (especially on PDA), Cp’ H atom abstraction, and intramolecular elimination of methane within 
M(CH3), units. This latter process is proposed on the basis of methylene transfer to acetone and some olefin metathesis activity 
to result in A13+-stabilized 
alkylidenes. Hydrogenolysis studies indicate that ca. 25% of the CP’~M(CH,),/DA surface M-CH3 
groups are removable as methane; reduction of methyl chloride to methane confirms the presence of surface M-H groups 
produced by hydrogenolysis. The Cp’,M(CH3),/DA complexes are active catalysts for propylene hydrogenation following 
a variety of pretreatment conditions, with Nt = 0.5 s-I in a flow reactor at -63 O
C
 (about 10 times more active than typical 
Pt/SiO, catalysts under the same conditions). M = Th and U are comparable in hydrogenation activity, and CO poisoning 
experiments indicate that ca. 3% of the adsorbed molecules is catalytically active. Cp’,M(CH,), complexes on PDA and silica 
gel are considerably less active catalysts. The Cp’,M(CH,),/DA 
systems are also active catalysts for ethylene polymerization 
and weakly active for butene isomerization. Experiments with Cp’,Th[CH2C(CH3),], and [Cp’,Th(p-H)H], on DA reveal 
activity for propylene hydrogenation comparable to the Cp’,M(CH,), systems. In contrast, more coordinatively saturated 
Cp,UCH3 and Cp3Th(n-C4H9) 
(Cp = v5-C5H5) 
are far less active, while Cp’Th(CH2C6H5), 
is far more active (Nt 
= 10 s-l). 
Much of the stoichiometric and catalytic surface chemistry can be understood in terms of solution organoactinide reactivity 
patterns. 
There is currently great interest in the structural, chemical, and 
catalytic properties of the unusual species formed when carbonyl 
and non-carbonyl transition-metal organometallic compounds are 
adsorbed on the surfaces of porous metal oxides such as y-alumina, 
silica, magnesia, zeolites, etc., 
In a number of cases, these 
supported species exhibit dramatic reactivity enhancements over

the precursor molecules in homogeneous solution, and high cat- 
alytic activity for such processes as the hydrogenation, metathesis, 
isomerization, and polymerization of olefins is observed. Several 
of these organometallic/metal oxide systems are also of techno- 
logical signifi~ance.~,~ 
The accurate characterization of such 
highly reactive molecule/support complexes has presented a great 
challenge and, in all but a few cases, the present structural/ 
mechanistic picture remains highly speculative.

Regarding the question of whether organoactinides might display 
interesting surface chemical properties, we recently reported that 
bis(pentamethylcyclopentadieny1)thorium 
and -uranium alkyls, 
when supported upon y-alumina, display high catalytic activity 
for olefin hydrogenation and polymerizati~n.~ 
The nature of these 
adsorbed species is of interest not only within the context of the 
new 5f surface chemistry currently evolving but also because 
certain distinctive chemical and spectroscopic characteristics of 
actinide ions may afford a better understanding, in general, of 
how metal oxide surfaces modify the properties of organometallic 
molecules. In the present contribution, we present a descriptive 
and mechanistic account of chemistry and catalysis using a series 
of organoactinides selected for varying metal redox characteristics, 
coordinative unsaturation, and two-electron ligands, adsorbed upon 
alumina surfaces offering varying ligation environments. Several 
experiments are also reported for silica gel. A preliminary account 
of surface chemistry involving two actinide methyl compounds 
and alumina has been recently reported.6 In an accompanying 
contribution,’ we report a complementary high-resolution solid- 
state 13C NMR study of some of the organoactinide/alumina 
surface complexes described herein. This provides important 
complementary information on the surface chemistry. 
Experimental Section 
Surface Chemical and Catalytic Techniques. The flow apparatus and 
procedures employed were generally similar to those previously de- 
scribed.8 Experiments could be run either in the pulse or in the flow 
mode. In 
the pulse mode, the pressure of a gas in the loop of the injection 
valve (Carle Microvolume, purged with helium) could be adjusted and 
then read with a capacitance manometer. This permitted a wide variation 
in pulse size, from 1 to 40 pmol. This pulse was injected into flowing 
hydrogen or helium. The hydrogenation of propylene could be run in the 
flow mode by passing hydrogen through a bed of porous Filtros ther- 
mostated at -78 “C and saturated with liquid pr~pylene.~ 
The ratio, 
H2/C3H6, 
was 4.6. Valves were Kontes Teflon-brand valves, Nupro 
bellows valves, or Whitey three-way ball valves. The apparatus was 
constructed mostly of 1/4-in. 
Pyrex tubing joined by Swagelock fittings 
with Teflon-brand ferrules. 
For catalytic reactions, we typically employed 10-20 pmol of actinide 
complex on 0.25 g of 60-80 mesh American Cyanamid PHF y-alumina, 
99.99% pure, which had been treated as previously described.8 In 
surface 
chemistry experiments we usually employed 25-50 pmol of organo- 
actinide/0.25 g of alumina. Partially dehydroxylated alumina (PDA) 
and dehydroxylated alumina (DA) were prepared by heating to prede- 
termined temperatures in flowing helium (vide infra). These supports 
were deuterated by the literature procedure.1° Flow rates of carrier in 
pulse experiments or of propylene plus hydrogen in flow hydrogenations 
were usually 0.1-0.4 mol h-l. The actinide complexes employed in this 
study are exceedingly oxygen sensitive. Therefore, the presence of O2 
at a parts per million level could cause serious deactivation in experiments 
lasting 1 day. Oxygen in gases that flow continuously over the catalyst 
is much more serious than O2 
in gases used only as pulses. The final 
means of reducing the content of O2 
was a trap of 10% 
MnO/Si02 
which 
reduces the content of O2 
to the parts per billion range and which just 
preceded the catalytic reactor.”

Cp3Th(n-C4H9)14 
(Cp = q5-C5H,), and CP,UCH~’~ 
were prepared and 
purified by the literature procedures. Complexes incorporating the CD3 
functionality were prepared with CD3Li 
(from CD31 
(Cambridge Isotope 
Laboratories) and Li in diethyl etherI6). These materials were handled 
in Schlenk ware interfaced to a high-vacuum line or in a Vacuum At- 
mosphere inert atmosphere box equipped with a high-capacity atmo- 
sphere recirculator. 
Acetone was distilled anaerobically from 4A molecular sieves into and 
stored in a flask provided with a Kontes Teflon valve. Pentane was 
sequentially treated with concentrated H2S04, 
KMn04 
solution, MgS04, 
and Na + molecular sieves. It was then saturated with N2 
and, under 
inert gas flush, poured into a flask containing P205 
and stirred overnight. 
It was finally subjected to three freeze-pump-thaw 
cycles and vacuum 
transferred to a flask containing Na/K alloy. After stirring overnight, 
the pentane was considered ready for catalytic experiments. It was 
vacuum transferred to flask 2 of the reaction apparatus (Figure 1) and 
stored over Cp’,UCI2 as an indicator. GC analysis revealed only minute 
traces of pentene as a contaminant. The purity of the pentane was found 
to be critical. Benzene was purified by multiple vacuum distillations from 
Na/K alloy. 
In pulse experiments, propylene was purified only by a MnO/Si02 
trap just preceding the catalyst bed. In flow hydrogenation, which in- 
volved exposure of the catalyst to much larger amounts of propylene, the 
propylene was first purified in the apparatus by freeze-thaw operations 
to remove one-fourth of the propylene originally condensed. Following 
this, propylene was condensed in the Filtros bed during which the residual 
one-fifth of the propylene was discarded. Before directing the H2 
+ C3H6 
flow to the catalyst, hydrogen was passed through the Filtros saturator 
at -78 O
C
 for 30 min and vented to remove any lower boiling gases. 
Helium was initially purified by passage through a trap of Davison 
grade 62 silica gel (average pore diameter, 14 nm) at -196 O C  
followed 
by a MnO/Si02 
trap. Another MnO/Si02 
trap just preceded the pulse 
injection valve. 
Hydrogen was supplied by an Elhygen (Milton Roy) electrolytic 
generator in which the hydrogen passed through Pd,Ag alloy. In the 
pulse mode, hydrogen was passed through an MnO/Si02 
trap 
just before 
the injection valve or, in the flow mode, just before the saturator.

Carbon monoxide, ethylene, butylene, and methyl chloride were used 
only in the pulse mode. Any oxygen or water in these gases would be 
removed by the final MnO/Si02 trap. Deuterium was also purified only 
by the MnO/Si02 trap just preceding the reactor. 
Measurement of the Oxygen Content of Carrier Gases. The oxygen 
content at any position in the system could be measured by inserting a 
0.6% MnO/Si02 
trap, passing hydrogen or helium at a known flow rate 
through the trap, and measuring the rate of advancement of a brown 
band. The process was calibrated by injection of a known, small pulse 
of 02. 
MnO/Si02 is brown in the oxidized form, green in the reduced 
form. Content in oxygen at the entrance to the reactor was less than 0.03 
PPm. 
Catalyst Preparation and Activation. These operations were effected 
in the apparatus of Figure 1 which was connected to the rest of the 
apparatus at the inlet and outlet by means of flexible 1/16-in. 
stainless 
steel tubing and Swagelock unions. Alumina (0.25 g) was placed in the 
reactor, a flow of helium was established through it and it was activated 
with He,475’,1 (flowing helium 475 OC, 1 h) to give PDA (partially 
dehydroxylated alumina) or with He, - 
1000°,0.3 to give DA (dehy- 
droxylated alumina).*Jo8J7 Dehydroxylation at 950 and 1025 O

 ap- 
peared to give the same results within experimental reproducibility. 
These activation codes give the flowing gas, the temperature (“C), and 
the duration of activation in hours. Bulb 1 and the plunger of valve A 
were transferred to the glovebox along with a vial provided with an 
air-tight cap. About 10-30 mg of complex was added to the vial, which 
was then capped, removed from the glovebox, and accurately weighed. 
The vial was then returned to the glovebox and opened and the complex 
was transferred to bulb 1, a magnetic stirring bar was added, the plunger 
was inserted and rotated to the closed position. The amount of complex 
added was found by removing the vial from the glovebox and weighing 
it. Bulb 1 was then reattached to the position shown in Figure I. Valves 
A, B, and C were closed and the region between them was evacuated 
overnight. Helium was admitted and then evacuated to 5 X 
torr. 
Valve A was opened and evacuation-filling with helium was repeated 3 
times. After a final evacuation, pentane (usually 5-6 cm3) 
was distilled 
from bulb 2 to bulb 1 by cooling bulb 1 to 78 K. After warming, the 
complex was dissolved in the pentane by use of the stirring bar. A flow 
of helium was then initiated through the reactor with valve C open. Bulb 
1 was rotated up so as to deliver its contents to the reactor, which was 
maintained at 0 OC, and the flow of helium was increased so as to fluidize 
the alumina. The purpose of fluidization was to make the distribution 
of complex on the alumina as uniform as possible. The complex was fully 
adsorbed within a few seconds. The flow of helium was reduced to about 
30 cm3 min-I and continued until the alumina appeared dry. The re- 
sulting complex/alumina was then activated in flowing helium or hy- 
drogen. 
During catalyst preparation and activation, the effluent from the re- 
actor passed through an empty trap at -196 O
C
 to remove pentane and 
then a -196 O
C
 silica gel trap to remove methane and other hydro- 
carbons. Warming released these as a pulse which could be analyzed 
catharometrically either directly or after passage through a gas chro- 
matographic column. Pulses containing CHI, CO, N2, and O2 
were 
separated on a 2-ft column of molecular sieve 13X. When it was desired 
to analyze for hydrogen in the helium carrier, the effluent stream from 
the silica gel trap was passed through molecular sieve 5A at 78 K. 
Warming released a pulse of hydrogen which was converted to one of 
water by CuO at 500 O C  before the thermal conductivity cell. A 4-ft 
column of bis[(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl] ether on 6C-80 mesh Gas-Chrom 
R. A. (Applied Science Laboratories) was used to separate hydrocarbons. 
Where GC/MS analysis was to be performed, hydrocarbons were re- 
moved by a silica gel trap at 78 K which could be isolated and detached 
for transferral to the GC/MS unit. 
Hydrogenation and Polymerization. In 
flow hydrogenation, effluent 
from the reactor passed through the loop of an injection valve which 
permitted samples to be injected into a stream of helium passing through 
the aforementioned chromatographic column so as to analyze the propane 
and propylene. During flow hydrogenations, the reactor was usually 
maintained at -63 O
C
 either with a chloroform slush bath or by means 
of a CryoCool refrigerator with a CryoCool temperature controller. 
In 
studies of the polymerization of ethylene, a series of about 20 pulses 
of ethylene were injected into helium flowing over the catalyst at 30 cm3 
m i d .  Unadsorbed ethylene was then separated on a silica gel GC 
column. The amount of ethylene in each exit pulse was determined, and 
the loss of ethylene was calculated. In 
some cases, the ethylene passing 
through the catalyst in a series of pulses was collected in a silica trap at 
-196 “C and then released as a pulse for catharometric analysis by 
warming the trap. The moles of ethylene in a pulse was adjusted to be 
about equal to the moles of the actinide element on the catalyst. The

total C2H4/M 
ratio (M = U or Th) was then calculated. 
Adsorption of Carbon Monoxide. The amount of carbon monoxide 
adsorbed on a catalyst was determined by a pulse technique either in 
helium or in hydrogen carrier. The pulse size was adjusted so that most 
of the first pulse was adsorbed and retained by the catalyst. The amount 
of a pulse that passed unadsorbed through the catalyst bed was measured 
catharometrically. Several further pulses were injected until no further 
adsorption was evident. The temperature of the catalyst was usually 25 
“C during these experiments. 
Spectrophotometric Studies of Cp’H Ring Loss. A special, anaerobic 
“H-shaped” 
optical spectroscopy cell was constructed with Kontes valve 
high-vacuum connections. One leg of the “H” consisted of a vacuum- 
tight fused-silica cuvette (sealed on) and the other a Pyrex reaction 
chamber. This allowed reagents to be distilled in or products removed 
on the high-vacuum line. Spectra could be recorded by pouring super- 
natant solutions into the cuvette leg. In 
a typical experiment, the optical 
cell was charged with a weighed amount of Cp’,Th(CH,), (typically 
-40-50 
rmol) and DA or PDA (0.5 g) in the glovebox. It was then 
attached to the high-vacuum line and evacuated and a known amount 
of pentane transferred by trap-to-trap distillation at 77 K. The apparatus 
was then back-filled with Ar, removed from the line, and shaken by hand 
for - 
1 h. At this time, a UV spectrum from 350 to 220 nm was obtained 
(in general, spectra did not change over the subsequent 12 h). 
To calculate the yield of Cp’H released on adsorbing Cp’,Th(CH,), 
on DA or PDA, the following procedure was carried out. Using the data 
system of the spectrophotometer, the UV spectrum of a pure sample of 
Cp’H in pentane (at known concentration) was recorded. Next, spectra 
of pentane and pentane + DA were recorded. These latter spectra were 
essentially identical except for a very week absorption in the pentane due 
to pentene, which disappeared upon treatment with DA. The change in 
absorbance ( A )  was, however, very small-l-2%. 
Next, spectra of 
CP’,T~(CH~)~/DA 
or CP’~T~(CH,)~/PDA 
supernatants were recorded, 
and the pentane spectrum was subtracted from them. The concentration 
and yield of Cp’H was then calculated using A values at several points 
in the spectrum and taking the average. For CP’~T~(CH~)~/DA, 
this 
procedure gave the following percentages of Cp’H released for four 
different experiments: 0.16%, 0.25%, <O.l%, <0.1%. For Cp’,Th- 
(CH3),/PDA, two experiments yielded 2.6% and 2.0% cleavage. Ref- 
erence to control spectra of Cp’,Th(CH,), 
in pentane revealed that 
negligible quantities of the organoactinide remained unadsorbed. 
The foregoing analysis makes the assumption that free Cp’H is not 
adsorbed by the Cp’2M(CH3)2-covered alumina under the reaction 
conditions. In a separate experiment, it was found that after I h of 
shaking, ca. 80% of a 9-kmol sample of Cp’H in pentane was adsorbed 
by 0.5 g of pure DA. However, under the same conditions, negligible 
Cp’H adsorption was measured for DA samples pretreated with 
CP’~T~(CH,), 
at the usual loading. 
Instrumental Measurements. The purity and/or isotopic composition 
(e.g., Cp’,M(CD3),) of all organoactinides was routinely monitored by 
’H 
NMR using a JEOL FX-90 or FX-270 spectrometer. Solutions were 
studied in benzene-& Spectrophotometric experiments were carried out 
with a Perkin-Elmer Hitachi Model 330 UV-vis-near-IR 
spectropho- 
tometer and interfaced Perkin-Elmer data system. 
Mass spectrometric studies were conducted with a Hewlett-Packard 
Model 5985 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and interfaced data 
system. Deuterium incorporation studies employed a nominal ionizing 
voltage of 12 eV and procedures discussed previously.’* For methane 
analyses, authentic samples of CD4, 
CD3H, 
and CH3D 
were employed 
as reference compounds. In making corrections for fragment ions of 
isotopically exchanged species, it was assumed that the probability of 
C-D fragmentation was 0.85 that of C-H. Methane samples were in- 
jected directly into the mass spectrometer. Interference from water (m/e 
18 amu) considerably limited the accuracy of CH,D2 assays. 
Results 
We begin this section with a brief synopsis of the chemical 
properties of organoactinide complexes and of alumina which are 
crucial to the design and analysis of the present experiments. We 
then focus upon organoactinide + alumina surface reaction 
pathways, using Cp’,M(CH3), 
compounds as models. 
The 
properties of the adsorbed species are next probed using several 
diagnostic stoichiometric reagents. Finally, the catalytic properties 
of a selected group of alumina-supported organoactinides are 
examined, using propylene hydrogenation, butene isomerization, 
and ethylene polymerization as prototype transformations.

Cp’,M(CHJ2. Surface Reaction Pathways. Initial experiments 
established that C P ’ ~ M ( C H ~ ) ~  
compounds are rapidly adsorbed 
from hydrocarbon solutions onto PDA or DA. This transformation 
is particularly striking for Cp’,U(CH,), in pentane-upon 
slur- 
rying with alumina, the dark red solutions are rapidly decolorized 
and the alumina becomes bright orange in color. There is no 
evidence that the adsorbed Cp’,U(CH,), 
can be removed by 
prolonged extiaction with toluene or pentane. Assuming that 
Cp’H adsorption on Cp’2M(CH3)2-covered 
alumina is unimportant 
under the reaction conditions, quantitative solution spectropho- 
tometric experiments (see Experimental Section for details) in- 
dicate that for typical CP’,M(CH~)~ 
coverages on DA, less than 
ca. 0.15% 
of available Cp’ ligands are protolytically liberated into 
the solvent as Cp’H upon room temperature activation, while on 
PDA, this quantity is on the order of ca. 2.5%. The degree to 
which Cp’ ligands might be lost from the actinide centers but still 
firmly retained on the surface is more difficult to assess. However, 
both the known solution chemistry of the C P ’ ~ M R ~  
c ~ m p l e x e s ~ ~ ~ ~  
and the surface N M R  results7 argue that such processes are not 
competitive with transformations occurring at M-C and M-H 
u bonds. 
During activation of adsorbed CP’,U(CH~)~ 
and CP’,T~(CH,)~ 
in flowing helium or hydrogen at temperatures up to 150 “C, 
the 
only compound that is evolved in detectable quantities is methane. 
Significantly, the amount of H2 
liberated by CP’~U(CH,), is less 
than 0.01 equiv (H2/U), arguing that the bulk of the uranium 
centers remain in the 4+ oxidation state. Only during activation 
in flowing hydrogen at temperatures in excess of 200 “C are higher 
hydrocarbons, Le., C2H6 and C3H8, 
noted. These are presumably 
formed by decomposition of Cp’. In Table I are shown data from 
a typical activation experiment carried out over a range of con- 
ditions. Here an abbreviation of the form He,0”,1 indicates

activation in flowing helium at 0 “C for 1 h. It can be seen that 
the rate of formation of methane decreases with time and, on DA, 
at 100 “C in He, the total CH4/M yield is much less than the 
available CH3/M in the starting complexes and less than the total 
available surface hydroxyl (OH/M = 
0.4). Experiments involving 
activation under H2 
will be discussed in a following section. In 
general, Cp’,U(CH3), and Cp’,Th(CH3), exhibit similar behavior 
with regard to methane yields. Minor variations probably result 
from differences in loading, degree of alumina dehydroxylation 
(vide infra), and possible impurities present during catalyst 
preparation and activation. 
A set of deuterium labeling experiments at loadings 51.0 
Cp’,M(CH3),/100 A2 DA was next devised to delineate the 
pathways for methane evolution, both as a function of alumina 
hydroxylation, M, and activation conditions (heating under a He 
flow at various temperatures). Experiments with CP’~M(CH,),, 
Cp’,M(CD,),, PDA, and DA (and deuterated analogues PDA-d, 
DA-d) were designed to probe for three methane-evolving path- 
ways, all of which have precedent in homogeneous organoactinide 
or organotransition-metal chemistry. These are p r o t o n ~ l y t i c ~ ~ - ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
H abstraction from a surface O H  (pathway S), H abstraction from 
a Cp’ ring (pathway R),,’ and H abstraction from another methyl 
group (pathway M).2s As depicted without specification as to 
molecular structure or reaction molecularity in Scheme I, ex- 
periments 1, 2, and 3 assay pathways S ,  M, and R, respectively. 
Furthermore, this experiment contains a built-in self-consistency 
test. If Scheme I accurately portrays the methane-evolving 
chemistry and certain complications are unimportant (vide infra) 
the sum of the S + R + M methane yields in any set of exper- 
iments should equal 100% (1 
.O as mole fractions). 
Several possible complications must, however, be considered. 
Independent isotopic exchange between evolved methane and the 
alumina support would obviously vitiate the pathway assays. 
Control experiments established that CH, exchange with PDA-d 
or DA-d is negligible under the reaction conditions (as also implied 
from the l i t e r a t ~ r e ~ ~ ) .  
Likewise, other experiments (vide infra) 
evidence little indication that surface organoactinide species ac- 
tivate exogenous saturated hydrocarbons under the present reaction 
conditions. Dilution of M-CD3 isotopic labels via exchange with 
ring-bound protons or pronounced kinetic isotope effects are more 
difficult to rule out. In regard to the former, we note that evolved 
methane isotopic distribution patterns adhere closely to the al- 
ternatives in Scheme I (CD, or CD,H; CH3D 
or CH,), whereas 
exchange with the 30 Cp’ methyl hydrogens would likely lead to 
a broader distribution of labeled methanes. Although there is 
reasonable precedent for a nonzero kinetic isotope effect in re- 
actions roughly analogous to each of the S, 
R, or M  pathway^,^^,^^ 
it is not clear that the C-H/C-D 
scission processes are rate 
determining or that there is actual competition among the hy- 
drogen-abstraction pathways. Perhaps the most compelling ar- 
gument that these effects do not grossly skew the analyses is the 
self-consistency in reaction pathway yields over a variety of ex- 
periments where the partitioning differs considerably. 
The results of the labeling experiments are summarized in Table 
11; agreement with the yields in Table I are reasonable but not

excellent. Table I1 shows that under all conditions, methane yields 
are far greater on PDA than on DA. Furthermore, pathway S 
is always dominant on PDA, and the sum of S + R + M = 1.0. 
On DA, the behavior of Cp’,U(CH,), and Cp’,Th(CH,), is rather 
similar, but now pathway S is less important. Although R and 
M are of greater relative importance on DA, absolute R and M 
yields through He, 100 “C, are nearly identical for Cp’,U(CH,), 
on PDA and DA. Again the sum of S + R + M = 1.0 except 
where methane yields approach the detection limits. To test 
whether M products might arise from bimolecular processes, a 
crossover experiment was conducted in which a mixture of 25.8 
rmol of C P ’ , T ~ ( C H ~ ) ~  
and 29.9 &mol 
of CP’~T~(CD,), 
was ad- 
sorbed on DA and also activated under He,OO,l; He,25”,1; 
He,lOOO,l. Importantly, the products from all three activation 
periods (CD4, CHD,, and CHI, but negligible CH,D) were 
identical with the sum of the isotopic distributions from separate 
Cp’,Th(CH3), and Cp’,Th(CD,), activations. It is thus possible 
to estimate that the component of pathway M, which is intra- 
molecular, is greater than 95%.

only ca. 17% of the available methyl groups for Cp',U(CH3), and 
only ca. 13% for C P ' ~ T ~ ( C H ~ ) ~ .  
To probe the fate of the re- 
maining M-CH3 functionalities, hydrogenolysis (c.f., eq 243'2), 
and surface NMR spectroscopic investigations' were carried out. 
The data in Table I typify Hz,10O0,1 methane yields found on 
DA-the 
methane yield is approximately doubled, but the cu- 
mulative yield is still far below stoichiometric. Labeling exper- 
iments (Scheme 11, Table 1
1
1
)
 provide more information on the 
source of methane from Cp',U(CD3), and Cp',Th(CD,), 
at 
H2,1000,1. First, essentially no CH4 
is produced by H2,1000,1 
activation, nor CH3D by D2,1000,131a 
activation. Thus, there is 
no evidence for significant hydrogenolysis of the methyl groups 
of Cp' under these conditions. Second, on PDA H2,1000,1, 
there 
is considerably less methane produced than on DA under identical 
conditions (vide infra); however, the cumulative yield on PDA 
now reaches 81% of the available methyl groups. The bulk of 
the evolved methane is CHD,, so pathway M is unimportant; 
pathways S, R, and hydrogenolysis cannot be distinguished from 
these data. With CP',U(CD~)~/DA, 
the yields of methane from 
H2,1000,1 are roughly equal to those from the preceding pre- 
treatment with He. Cumulative yields are on the order of 35% 
of available methyl functionalities. It can be seen in Scheme I1 
that under the assumptions made for the investigations in Scheme 
I (vide supra), labeling experiments 1-3 approximately assay the 
relative importance of pathways S, R, M, and hydrogenolysis (H). 
Assuming approximate additivity of the various pathways, we find 
that for H2(D2),1000,1, 
the methane/U yields on DA are roughly 
on the order of 0.003, 0.01, ~ 0 . 0 7 ,  
and ~ 0 . 2  
for M, S, R, and 
H, respectively (Table III).31b Comparison of uranium (exper- 
iment 1) with that for thorium (experiment 4, Table 111) indicates 
that both metals behave rather similarly. Thus, the hydrogenolysis 
experiments strongly argue for the presence of actinide-methyl 
groups on the surface-bound species, but only ca. 25% are ac- 
cessible for cleavage by H2,

OO", 
1 .  
The occurrence of pathway H suggests the presence (at least 
transitory) of actinide-hydride functionalities on the surface. 
Considering the importance of M-H functionalities to the catalysis 
results (vide infra) and the possibility that processes analogous 
to S and R pathways could destroy surface organoactinide hy- 
drides, assays of active M-H groups were carried out by titrating 
with CH3Cl (cf. eq 5 ) .  Complexes CP',T~(CH,)~ 
and Cp',U- 
(CH,), were adsorbed on DA by the usual procedure and were 
then pretreated by He,0°,1;H2,1000,1;He,1000;He,250. 
The latter 
two steps were conducted to sweep out any desorbable H2 and 
CHI. When methane in the helium stream had fallen to 0.1 pmol 
h-l, a pulse of methyl chloride (120-160 pmol) was injected at 
25 "C, and the evolved products were collected and analyzed by 
GC. For 49.4 pmol of Cp',Th(CH,),, the pretreatment conditions 
liberated methane/Th = 0.34; exposure to CH3Cl liberated an 
(31) (a) Minimal exchange of surface OH groups with D2 is expected 
under these relatively mild conditions.I0 (b) The somewhat different activation 
conditions of experiment 3 limit the accuracy of the R pathway assay. 
However, the assay of pathway H in experiment 3 should be reasonably 
accurate since CD4 evolution via the M pathway is invariably small (cf. 
experiment 1 and Table 11) and not reasonably expected4*12 
to be accelerated 
by H2.

To investigate methylidene transfer activity, samples of the

compounds on DA, activated at 
He,OO,l;He,lOOO,l, 
were treated with 100-pmol pulses of acetone 
vapor, injected into the helium stream at 25 “C. One molecule 
of acetone adsorbed per nanometer squared would correspond to 
60 pmol of acetone on 0.25 g of alumina. The effluent stream 
was passed through an empty tube at 78 K, and a released pulse 
of the trapped material was analyzed by GC. The trapping 
procedure did not trap methane. Pulses of acetone’were also 
passed over DA prepared as usual and treated with pentane in 
the usual fashion but without added complex. The results of these 
acetone experiments are shown in Table IV. In

additional experiments in which a single 100-pmol pulse of acetone 
was employed. In

are on the order of ca. 20% of the methane formed via pathway 
M for CP',U(CH~)~ 
and ca. 30% of the methane formed via 
pathway M for Cp',Th(CH3),. 
In the case of Cp'2Th(CH3)2, 
an 
assay of evolved methane was also conducted. The yield was 
significantly higher than that of isobutene. This observation is 
tentatively interpreted in terms of a previously observed metalation 
pattern (eq 
9).35 The propane + 
propylene and pentane detected 
Cp3ThCH3 + CH3C(=O)CH3 - 
Cp,ThOC(=CH2)CH3 + CH4 (9) 
in this reaction are ascribable to acetone-DA reaction products 
and solvent, respectively. 
Activity of the adsorbed Cp',M(CHJ2 complexes for olefin 
metathesis was probed by exposing pretreated (He,OO,l;He,lOOO,l) 
samples on DA to propylene. First, a pulse of 0.6 pmol of pro- 
pylene was passed over 55.7 
pmol of Cp'2Th(CH3)2/DA 
at 100 
"C in helium carrier. Hydrocarbons were removed by a silica 
gel trap at -196 OC and subsequently analyzed by GC. It was 
found that 0.014 pmol of methane, 0.01 pmol each of ethylene 
and propane, and about 0.003 pmol each of isobutylene, 1-butene, 
trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and pentane had been produced. In 
view of these low yields, static experiments were run in which a 
2-pmol pulse of propylene was isolated in the reactor held at 100 
OC for 1 h, helium flow was restored, and the hydrocarbons were 
caught in an empty trap at -196 "C. This procedure does not 
trap methane. Some mixing was effected by alternately cooling 
and warming two U-tubes, which had been inserted on each side 
of the reactor. A blank experiment was run in which DA was 
prepared in situ and treated as described under reaction with 
acetone. Products were pentane (0.020 pmol) and traces of 
propane but no butenes or butanes. The additional hydrocarbons 
collected in the Cp',M(CH,),/DA 
metathesis experiments are 
set out in Table VI. No isobutane was detected. To test lifetime 
for metathesis activity, three successive experiments were run at 
100 "C on Cp'2Th(CH3)2/DA activated in the usual manner. By 
the third pulse, olefin product yields had decreased to ca. 25% 
of the yields in the first pulse. In a similar experiment with only 
two pulses, increasing the temperature to 150 "C for the second 
pulse resulted in a modest increase in olefin yield.

Catalysis with Adsorbed Cp',M(CH3), Species. Propylene 
Hydrogenation as a Model Reaction. Studies of propylene hy- 
drogenation, catalyzed by adsorbed CP',M(CH~)~ 
species that had 
been subjected to various activation conditions, were carried out 
as described in the Experimental Section. To keep conversions 
below 100% for most activation procedures, when using the 
maximum possible hydrogen flow rate (160 cm3 min-I) and the 
minimum practical catalyst loadings, it was necessary to operate 
at -63 OC during hydrogenation runs. Below this temperature, 
filling of the catalyst pores with liquid propylene becomes likely. 
For these reasons, the turnover frequencies (NJ reported in this 
work (propylene molecules hydrogenated per actinide atom per 
second) are most useful for intercomparing relative rates. 
In Table VI1 are shown the results of some typical propylene 
hydrogenation experiments as a function of activation conditions. 
Although the effect is not major, it can be seen that N, increases 
slightly with the temperature of H, pretreatment. However, in 
a separate experiment it was found that while 10.2 pmol of 
Cp'JJ(CH,),/DA gave after H2,1000,1 
Nt = 0.45 s-l, subsequent 
activation at H2,2000,1 gave Nt = 0.13 s&. Thus, very high 
activation temperatures result in diminution of Nt. The final 
pretreatments, He,lOOO,l and H2,100",1, led to nearly the same 
steady-state catalytic activities. The length of activation times 
does not appear to have a very large effect upon Nt. Thus, the 
catalyst prepared in Table I gave N, = 0.55 s-' after the final 
activation. This value is comparable to that for other CP'~U- 
(CH3)2-derived 
catalysts (cf. Table VIII). 
Turnover frequency data for a variety of other propylene hy- 
drogenation experiments with adsorbed C P ' , U ( C H ~ ) ~  
or 
Cp'2Th(CH3)2 
are compiled in Tables VI11 and IX. 
Several 
trends are worthy of note. First, hydrogenation activities on PDA 
are far lower than on DA. Second, the large amount of data in 
Table VI1 indicates that there is a general trend for increasing

Nt is essentially unchanged. 
This result and those to be discussed below suggest that mass 
transport effects are likely to be rather minor in these experiments. 
Lastly, catalytic results with C P ' ~ U ( C H ~ ) ~  
supported on silica gel 
are reported in Table VIII. Activity for propylene hydrogenation 
is low. 
A series of isotopic tracer experiments was conducted in which 
pulses of propylene were injected into deuterium flowing over

(pretreatment:

(pretreatment: He,OO,l;He,lOOO,l) 
at 0 "C. 
Conversions to propane were loo%, and it was found mass 
spectrometrically that 290% of the propane was propane-d2. It 
was also found in a blank experiment that propane pulses over 
pure DA underwent no detectable isotopic exchange with the 
deuterium carrier at 25, 50, or 100 "C. 
For reference, the rate of hydrogenation of propylene on 80-100 
mesh 0.78% Rh/Davison grade 62 silica gel was measured at -63 
"C. The catalyst was prepared by ion exchange with Rh- 
(NH3)5(0H2)3+ 
and reduction in hydrogen at 370 "C. It had a 
percentage of exposed Rh of 58% as measured by hydrogen 
chemisorption at 25 "C. 
It was pretreated in situ with 
02,3000,0.5;H2,3000,0.5 
and cooled in H2 
to -63 "C. The rate 
of hydrogenation of propylene declined somewhat initially, but 
was constant from 95 to 155 min, N, = 27 s-l per Rh,. 
To date, it has not been possible to obtain normal kinetic data 
on the Cp',M(CH,),-catalyzed 
propylene hydrogenation. All 
unpoisoned catalysts are so active that practicable amounts of 
complex at practicable flow rates give conversions of 50% or 
greater. Such high activity prevents operation in the differential 
regime. Further, of course, activation energies could not be ob- 
tained. However, some kinetic information was obtained for 
poisoned or deactivated catalysts. One such catalyst consisted 
of 19.6 pmol of Cp',U(CH3)2 on DA-the 
low activity was ap- 
parently a consequence of improperly purified pentane. The flow 
rate of C3H6 
+ H2 
was varied, and Nt (0.018 s-I) was found to 
be constant over a range of conversions of 0.025 to 0.15. In an 
experiment with 12.1 pmol of Cp',U(CH,), (on DA) which ex- 
hibited an initial Nt of 0.92 s-l and which had become deactivated 
by several days use, Nt was approximately constant at 0.17 s-I 
over a range of conversions of 0.15-0.85. These results suggest 
that, at least for a deactivated catalyst, the hydrogenation reaction 
is near zero order in olefin. Any effect of change in pressure of 
hydrogen would not have been detectable within the limits of 
experimental reproducibility. 
The question of the intrusion of mass transport effects can be 
approached using the Wei-Prater ~riterion.,~ 
Assuming that Deff 
is 0.1 times that of the bulk diffusion coefficient of propylene,36 
a Wei-Prater number ca. 0.5 is obtained for the first entry in Table 
VIII. Thus, the values of Nt in Tables VI11 and IX should be 
free of the effects of concentration gradients of propylene in the 
catalyst pores unless there are severe local concentration gradients 
in the pores resulting from the very high rates at the small fraction

of adsorbed molecules of complex that become converted to 
catalytic sites. On the basis of the Wei-Prater criterion, hy- 
drogenations on the more active Rh/Si02 are marginal with 
respect to the intrusion of the effects of mass transport. The 
question of the intrusion of the effects of heat transport is less 
clear, particularly in the case of the Rh catalyst just mentioned. 
Poisoning of Cp'2M(CH3)2-Catalyzed 
Propylene Hydrogenation 
by Carbon Monoxide. The injection of pulses of carbon monoxide 
at 25 "C has a dramatic effect on the hydrogenation activity of 
CP',M(CH~)~/DA 
catalysts. General information on the chemical 
systematics is given in Tables VIII, IX, and XI1 and in the dis- 
cussion which follows. In all cases, CO/M adsorption ratios are 
rather small, indicating that only a fraction of the actinide sites 
is reactive. A blank experiment on 0.25 g of DA impregnated 
with pentane and pretreated in the usual manner indicated that 
CO adsorption on DA-only 
ca. 0.03 pmol-is 
not a major 
constituent of the ad~orption.~' 
The quantity of CO adsorbed 
by the supported organometallics is approximately the same when 
measured immediately after activation as after a preliminary 
hydrogenation run at -63 "C. In general, if catalyst activation 
was in hydrogen, CO adsorption was measured from a hydrogen 
carrier, while if catalyst activation was in helium, CO adsorption 
was measured from helium. It can be seen that CO/M ratios are 
rather similar for the two activation modes. Adsorptions of carbon 
monoxide were measured on two samples of about 16 pmol of 
CP'~T~(CH,),/DA, 
one activated in H2,1000,1 
and the other in 
He,lOOO,l. The hydrogen was then changed to helium and the 
helium to hydrogen and the adsorption of a second pulse of carbon 
monoxide was measured. The additional amounts of carbon 
monoxide adsorbed were small, but essentially identical within 
the experimental error. 
When hydrogenation experiments at -63 "C were conducted 
immediately after CO adsorption from either helium or hydrogen 
at 25 "C, catalytic activity was found to be markedly depressed. 
In the case of CO adsorption from hydrogen, Nt values fell to 
410% of normal values and remained at this level. For example, 
in experiments with 6.6 and 32.2 pmol of C P ' , T ~ ( C H ~ ) ~ / D A  
in 
Table IX and 11.2 pmol of Cp',U(CH,),/DA 
in Table VIII, the 
catalysts were saturated with carbon monoxide in hydrogen at 
25 "C and hydrogenations were run at -63 "C. Nt values after 
poisoning were 0.03, 0.01, and 0.05 s-*, 
respectively, and there 
was no increase in activity with time on stream. These activities 
were less than 10% of those before treatment with carbon mon- 
oxide. One immediate conclusion that follows from these results 
is that the bulk of the hydrogenation catalysis is occurring at a 
small fraction of the adsorbed organoactinide molecules. 
Although carbon monoxide appears to adsorb on the same sites 
from helium and from hydrogen streams and both procedures 
poison hydrogenation, different adsorbed species seem to result. 
Although neither adsorbed species desorbs significantly in flowing 
hydrogen or helium, at 25 "C, adsorbed CO is partly removed 
by hydrogen plus propylene at -63 "C from catalysts saturated 
with carbon monoxide in helium but, as already discussed, not 
from catalysts saturated with carbon monoxide in hydrogen. Thus, 
the activity of catalysts poisoned from flowing helium is slowly 
recovered. An example is provided by the experiments with 18.8 
and 37.6 pmol of CP',U(CH~)~/DA 
in Table VIII. Adsorption 
of carbon monoxide in helium at 25 "C was measured on the 
18.8-pmol sample directly after activation, on the 37.6-pmol 
sample after a hydrogenation run at -63 "C followed by He,- 
63",0.5. Hydrogenation runs were then effected at -63 "C. N,'s 
(s-') and (conversions) at 5 min on stream and 90 min on stream 
were as follows: for 37.6 rmol, 0.05 (0.18) and 0.42 (0.91) and, 
for 18.8 pmol, 0.11 (0.11) and 0.31 (0.31). 
Adsorbed carbon monoxide also inhibited the reaction with 
acetone. Thus, adsorption of carbon monoxide was measured on 
18.2 pmol of Cp',U(CH,),, 
He,lOOO,l. The ratio CO/U was 
(37) Adsorption of CO at 25 O C  
on DA directly (without exposure to and 
evaporation of pentane) was larger, about 0.3 pmol per 0.25 g. Some pentane 
remained adsorbed on 
DA after He,Oo,l;He,lOOO,l 
during catalyst prepara- 
tion and activation. Some of this is displaced by acetone at 25 "C in the cases 
of CP'~U(CH,),/DA and Cp'2Th(CH3)2/DA.

1-butene in helium passed at 25 O C  over 17.9 pmol of CP'~U-

was about 50% isomerized, 
and the trans-2-butenelcis-2-butene 
ratio was ca. 3.6. On DA 
alone under similar conditions, the trans/& ratio was ca. 2.0. On 
55.7 Mmol of C P ' ~ T ~ ( C H ~ ) , / D A  
activated in He,lOOO,l, the 
conversion of a 1.6 pmol pulse of 1-butene in helium was 2% at 
0 O C .  A pulse was then passed at 50 "C. The conversion was 
13% and the l-butene/trans-2-butene ratio was about 12. Small 
amounts of pentane and butane and traces of propane, propylene, 
methane, and ethylene were also found. Further studies would 
be required to separate fully actinide and support contributions 
to these rather slow isomerizations. 
Ethylene polymerization was studied by injecting a series of 
ethylene pulses into helium flowing over the catalyst at 25 "C. 
The percentage of each pulse of ethylene that was adsorbed vs. 
pulse number is shown in Figure 2 for an experiment with 
Cp',U(CH3),. The initial adsorption of ethylene was nearly loo%, 
but even at the 45th pulse the adsorption was 30% of the pulse. 
The total loss in ethylene per atom of uranium, C,H,/U, was 42. 
Table X shows that C P ' ~ U ( C H ~ ) ~ / D A  
and C P ' ~ T ~ ( C H ~ ) , / D A  
have similar activities for ethylene polymerization. Control ex- 
periments verified that DA is not an ethylene polymerization 
catalyst. The properties of the polyethylene deposited on the 
catalyst were not examined. 
Carbon monoxide partially inhibited polymerization as shown 
in Table XI. 
Except for the experiment with 18.4 pmol of 
CP'~U(CH,)~, 
a polymerization experiment was conducted and 
carbon monoxide was injected into helium passing over the catalyst 
at 25 "C so as to measure the adsorption of CO. A further pulse 
of ethylene was then injected. Values of CO/M were similar to 
those reported in Tables VI11 and IX.

detectable ethylene polymerization activity at room temperature. 
Chemistry and Properties o
f
 Supported Organoactinides 
In regard to variation of Cp’,M< substituents, it is interesting 
to note that Cp’,U(CH,)Cl yields hydrogenation catalysts of 
relatively low activity, while the bulky38 neopentyl ligands of 
Cp’,Th[CH,C(CH,),], 
apparently present no impediment to 
hydrogenation activity. Indeed, this complex is one of the most 
active Cp’,Th< propylene hydrogenation catalysts. In the case 
of the 28.5-pmol catalyst, the successive adsorptions of three 
28.5-pmol pulses of ethylene subsequent to hydrogenation ex- 
periments were 95%, 94%, and 92%, implying substantial po- 
lymerization activity. In contrast, 54 pmol of Cp’,U(CH,)CI after 
He,lOOO,l was far less effective. Ethylene conversion in the first 
pulse (40 pmol) was only 30%, and fell to 15% by the fifth pulse; 
overall through pulse 5, C2H4/U 
= 0.7. 
The behavior of actinide-hydride functionalities was further 
investigated in experiments with [Cp’,Th(pH)H], on DA (Table 
XII). When adsorbed from pentane solutions (but not benzene 
solutions), this complex is an active propylene hydrogenation 
catalyst. During He,Oo, at surface OH/Th = 
0.8, the Hz/Th yield 
of 0.22 is substantially greater than CH4/Th yields from corre- 
sponding Cp’,Th(CH,), 
experiments (Table IX). To test the 
chemical accessibility 
of Th-H units, the 12.1-pmol hydrogenation 
catalyst was flushed with He,25”,1 and then treated with a 
160-pmol pulse of CH3CI at 25 OC. The yield of methane was 
1.09 pmol, or CH4/Th = 0.09, which is significantly higher than 
the 0.020-0.032 CH4/M ratios obtained with CH3C1 after hy- 
drogenolysis of Cp’,M(CH3), (vide supra). [Cp’,Th(p-H)H], is 
a less effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, and for the 
complex on DA activated by He,lOOO,l, 
conversion in the first 
pulse was 49%, with conversion falling to zero by the 14th pulse. 
Overall, conversion was C2H4/Th = 3.6. 
The most active hydrogenation catalyst discovered in this study 
was Cp’Th(CH2C6HS)3/DA. All samples were activated by 
He,O”,l;He,l 30°,1, the higher activation temperature being em- 
ployed to facilitate desorption of toluene. A UV-visible spec- 
troscopic examination of the material condensed in the -196 “C 
trap after He,Oo, 
1 
;He, 
1 
30°, 
1 revealed, in addition to pentane, the 
presence of toluene.39 The exact toluene/Th ratio has not yet 
been measured. In an early experiment at -63 OC, 8.0 pmol of 
Cp’Th(CH2C6Hj)3 
at 25 cm3 min-’ propylene gave 100% con- 
version (Nt 
> 3.0 s-’). In the present reaction apparatus, the use 
of small (ca. 1 pmol) amounts of complex gave poorly reproducible 
results, presumably owing to poisoning of the small quantities of 
organometallic complex employed. However, results with the more 
active samples indicate that Nt is greater than 10 s-l at -63 “C. 
The problem of heat and mass transport effects is the same as 
for Rh/SiO, (vide supra). The 8-pmol hydrogenation catalyst 
readily polymerized ethylene, and after 10 pulses (C2H4/Th 
= 
l), there was 98% conversion in the final pulse. 
It is of interest to note that the treatments He,O”,l;He,lOOO,l

led 
to the liberation of no methane. This supports the conclusion that 
such treatments do not lead to the liberation of methane from the 
methyl groups of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. 
The active catalysts shown in Table XI1 were poisoned by CO 
in the same manner as those derived from Cp’,M(CH,),. 
Small 
CO/M ratios were measured in all cases except [Cp’,Th(p-H)H],. 
Here the ratio was 0.085 and the value of Nt at -63 OC was only 
1% of the value prior to poisoning. Subsequent treatment at 
H,,lOOO,l raised Nt to only 2% of the initial value. 
Discussion 
From the results of this investigation it is evident that orga- 
noactinide/alumina surface chemistry is very rich, reflecting both 
the ligation of the actinide ion as well as the reactive functionalities

structures F and G is also derived from surface 13C 
NMR studies.’ 
A further role for the coordinatively unsaturated surface A13+ 
sites 
of DA follows from the N M R  studies which suggest strong in- 
teraction of actinide-bound alkyl ligands and by implication hy- 
dride ligands, with aluminum centers on the surface (e.g., I). In 
cases of high surface coverage by OH (PDA) the surface chemistry 
largely follows pathways leading to species of types F and G. Some 
q5-(CH3) 
,CS protonolysis also occurs, although this pathway is 
more difficult to quantitate (traces of Cp’H are liberated from 
the alumina; no species other than Cp’Th can be unambiguously 
discerned in the NMR’). Interestingly, however, pathways leading 
to species such as E and H are operative under all conditions of 
surface pretreatment and each to roughly the same absolute de- 
gree. There is no evidence that significant quantities of the 
adsorbed uranium ions attain an oxidation state higher than 4+. 
Chemical probes to test the reactivity of the adsorbed Cp’,M- 
(CH3)Z molecules reveal that there is a broad range in the re- 
activity of the M-CH, functionalities. For example, a rather large 
proportion of the CH3 
groups remaining on the surface (Le., not 
evolved as CH4) are not readily hydrogenolyzed, despite the high 
hydrogenolytic reactivity of the Cp’,M(CH3), compounds in so- 
lution (eq 2).12 In view of the expected properties of the surface 
species, this observation is not altogether unexpected. Thus. 
alkoxide ligands as in F are predicted from solution results12 
greatly 
to depress rates of hydrogenolysis, and coordinatively saturated 
methyl aluminates (e.g., I) may also be relatively u n r e a ~ t i v e . ~ ~  
In addition, it is conceivable that a number of adsorbed Cp’,M- 
(CH,), molecules occupy sites with sufficient steric hindrance to 
retard reaction with any exogenous reagents and/or that other 
deactivating surface reactions occur. Experiments with acetone 
indicate that alkylidene species E are active methylene transfer 
agents. However, the isobutylene yields indicate that not all sites 
are equally accessible to acetone. 
Hydrogenolysis of surface Cp’,M(CH,), 
species would rea- 
sonably be expected to yield adsorbed organoactinide hydrides, 
and, indeed, the formation of such species was confirmed by 
reactions with CH,CI. However, the extent of reaction with pulses 
of CH3C1 in stoichiometric excess indicate that a significant 
fraction of the hydride species are not readily accessible to CH3C1, 
possibly for some of the reasons cited above for hydrogenolysis. 
Experiments with [Cp’,Th(p-H)H], indicate that protolytic re- 
action with surface OH, presumably generating species analogous 
to F (CH3 = H) and G, is also operative for organoactinide 
hydrides. The NMR results’ support this conclusion. Again, only 
a fraction of the hydride centers react with pulses of CH3Cl 
at 
room temperature. 
With propylene hydrogenation as a model reaction, it was found 
that the Cp’,M(CH,),/DA 
complexes are highly active catalysts.

nucleophilic attack) are likely to be similar to those for olefin 
hydrogenation. Indeed, the parallels in the activity of the various 
actinide complexes for hydrogenation and polymerization, the 
similarities in maximum percentage of active sites deduced from 
poisoning experiments, and the observation that H, exposure 
diverts ethylene reactivity from polymerization to hydrogenation 
are all consistent with both processes occurring at very similar 
or identical sites. Butene isomerization could also occur in a cycle 
such as Scheme 111, in which olefin addition-elimination sequences 
(cf., i, ii) would effect double-bond migration. The endothermicity 
of 6-hydride eliminati~n’~ 
may explain the low activity. 
The results of this study provide much information on the 
stoichiometric and catalytic chemistry of organoactinides on 
various alumina and silica surfaces. Many of these results are 
likely generalizable to early transition elements and lanthanides. 
However, as is frequently the case in catalysts, it is not possible 
from the available information to generate a completely rigorous 
structural description of the catalytically active site(s). Still, it 
is evident that destruction or deactivation of metal-carbon (hy- 
drogen) bond reactivity (e.g., F, G) is detrimental to catalytic 
activity, while the creation of coordinatively unsaturated, highly 
electrophilic centers appears desirable. A structure such as or 
similar to I, which has been identified in the Cpt2Th(CH3),/DA 
surface NMR studies (vide infra),7 
requires the presence of surface 
Lewis acid centers (not available for silica26a,b,d) 
and would seem 
to fulfill many of the latter prerequisites. Future investigations 
will address these issues under both homogeneous and heteroge- 
neous conditions, as well as explore the scope of surface and 
catalytic chemistry as a function of f-element complex and support.

effective catalytic site, as measured by CO poisoning, activated 
Cp’,M(CH,),/DA gives a rate of propylene hydrogenation ca. 
300 times that of a surface atom of Pt. Rhodium is usually 
considered to be the most active heterogeneous hydrogenation 
catalyst. We measured Nt per Rh, on Rh/Si02 and found it to 
be -27 s-’ at -63 “C. In comparison, N, per Th of Cp’Th- 
(CH2C6H5),/DA 
is about 10 s-I at -63 “C, but per active site, 
about 300 s-’. The activity of this complex on DA is thus ex- 
traordinary, and all steps in the catalytic cycle must have unusually 
small activation energies. Thus, despite the aforementioned 
sluggish reactivity of a high percentage of the adsorbed species 
with respect to M-C hydrogenolysis (likely an essential component 
of the catalytic cycle; vide infra) it appears that a small fraction 
of the sites is highly reactive. That the percentage is small is also 
confirmed by the CO poisoning experiments, which place an upper 
limit on this fraction of ca. 2-3%. It is likely that the poisoning 
reaction involves migratory CO insertion, which in solution is 
generally irreversible for an actinide-carbon bond (eq 1) but 
reversible for an actinide-hydrogen bond (eq 2). The complexes 
Cp’,Th [CH,C(CH,),] 
and [ 
Cp’,Th(pH)H] are also precursors 
for highly active hydrogenation catalysts, so that a Th-CH3 
functionality is not an absolute necessity. The highest upper limits 
on the percentage of metal centers that are catalytically active, 
as deduced from CO poisoning, are found for these latter two 
complexes to be Cp’,Th[CH,C(CH,),],/DA, 
ca. 3%, and 
[Cp’,Th(pH)H],/DA, 8.5%. It is not clear at this time why the 
reversibility of poisoning varies with precatalyst and CO carrier. 
The observation that the catalytic behavior of Cp’,Th(CH3), and 
Cp’,U(CH,), is nearly identical argues that shuttling to metal 
3+, 5+, or 6+ 
oxidation states (reductive elimination, oxidative 
addition), which are not readily accessible to t h ~ r i u m , ~  
is not 
mechanistically important. Although supporting Cp’,M(CH,), 
complexes on DA yields highly active hydrogenation catalysts, 
supporting them on PDA or silica gel does not produce highly 
active catalysts. Upon impregnation with Cf2M(CH3),, the latter 
two systems evolve considerably greater yields of methane; Le., 
a higher percentage of precatalytically important (vide infra) 
M-CH, bonds is destroyed or apparently reduced in reactivity 
(e.g., F, G). Modifying the coordinative saturation about the 
actinide center also has dramatic consequences for the catalytic 
activity vis-&vis the CP’~M(CH,),/DA systems. Thus, more 
coordinatively saturated and generally less reactive Cp,MR 
compounds yield far less active hydrogenation catalysts under any 
pretreatment conditions, while the formally less saturated and 
highly reactive Cp’Th(CH2C6H5), 
complex yields the most active 
catalyst of all. 
A plausible scenario for catalytic olefin hydrogenation by an 
f-element catalyst, which is in accord with most of the findings 
of this study, is shown in Scheme 1

 Here the species in brackets 
are intermediates or transition states (unspecified). Assuming 
the metal does not change oxidation state, it can be seen that a 
hydrogenolyzable M-R or preformed M-H group is a straight- 
forward prerequisite to J. The facility with which steps i and ii 
occur will reflect, among other factors, the ease with which olefin 
can be accommodated in the metal coordination sphere. For 
Cp’,Th< systems this reaction is very rapidI2 
and is exothermic
