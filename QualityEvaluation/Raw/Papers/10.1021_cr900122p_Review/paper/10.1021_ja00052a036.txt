Abstract: This contribution reports a kinetic and mechanistic study of arene hydrogenation by the supported organoactinide 
complexes Cp’Th(benzyl),/DA (l/DA), Th( 1,3,5-CH2C6H3Me2),/DA 
(2/DA), and Th(~~-allyl),/DA 
(3/DA) where Cp’ 
= ?S-Me5C5 
and DA = dehydroxylated y-alumina. In slurry reactions (90 OC, PH2 
= 180 psi), the activity for benzene 
hydrogenation follows the order l/DA C 2/DA C 3/DA with an N, 
value for 3/DA of -25000 h-I active site-I. This approaches 
or exceeds most conventional platinum metal catalysts in efficacy for benzene reduction. Benzene hydrogenation by 3/DA 
at 90 OC, PH = 180 psi, follows the rate law Nt = ~[benzene]~[P~,]’ 
with N,(H2)/Nt(D2) 
= 3.5 f 
0.3 and E, = 16.7 f 
0.3 
kcal mol-’. hartially hydrogenation products cannot be detected at partial conversions, and there is no 
D2 incorporated in 
the unconverted benzene. D2 
is not delivered to a single benzene face, but rather a 1:3 mixture of &cis and cis,cis,truns,cis,truns 
isotopomers is formed. Active site characterizations using D20 
poisoning, hydrogenolysis, and CH3C1 
dosing indicate that 
1 8  
f 
1% of the Th surface sites are responsible for the bulk of the benzene hydrogenation. EPR and XPS studies provide 
no evidence for surface Th oxidation states less than +4. As 
a function of arene, the relative rates of Th(~$C,H~),/DA-catalyzed 
hydrogenation are benzene > toluene > 
p-xylene > naphthalene, with the regiochemistry 
of p-xylene reduction similar to that 
for benzene. Experiments with 1 
: 
1 benzene-p-xylene mixtures reveal that benzene is preferentially hydrogenated with almost 
complete 
exclusion of pxylene (-97:3), inferring that the benzene binding constant to the active sites is -6.7X that of p-xylene. 
It is possible to propose a mechanism for arene hydrogenation which involves single Th(IV) sites, includes inoperativity of 
oxidation addition/reductive elimination sequences, and passes among established metal-ligand structures via precedented 
pathways. 
Introduction 
The absorption of early transition element and actinide hy- 
drocarbyls on Lewis acidic surfaces (e.g., dehydroxylated alumina, 
MgC12, 
dehydroxylated Si02-A1,03) is frequently accompanied 
by marked (and potentially useful) enhancements in catalytic 
activity for olefin conversions such as polymerization, hydro- 
genation, and metathesi~.l-~

defined/constrained formal metal oxidation states, a range of 
available precursor coordinative unsaturation levels, built-in 
diamagnetic/paramagnetic spectroscopic probes, and a growing

In 
earlier catalytic work, we reported that materials of the type 
CP’,T~(CH~)~/DA 
and Cp’Th(CH2C6HS),/DA (Cp’ = qS-Me5Cs; 
DA = dehydroxylated y-alumina) are highly active catalysts for 
ethylene polymerization and, per active site, rival the activities 
of the most active platinum metal catalysts (e.g., Rh/Si02) for 
the hydrogenation of simple olefins.k,d The order of activity for 
the latter transformation, Cp’Th(CH2C6H5)3/DA > Cp’,Th- 
(CHJ2/DA > Cp,ThCH3/DA, suggests the importance of pre- 
cursor coordinative unsaturation in determining ultimate adsorbate 
catalytic activity. Correlated I3C CPMAS NMR 
identify alkyl anion abstraction processes (e.g., eq 1) as a key 
function of the support Lewis acid sites.8 Hydrocarbyl cations 
such as A are expected to be highly electrophilic and kinetically 
competent for the individual steps constituting olefin polymeri-

zation and hydrogenation cycles. Indeed, solution phase repre- 
sentations of A have recently confirmed these  expectation^.^^^^ 
The above observations raise two intriguing issues. First, it 
would be of interest to learn whether supported organoactinide 
catalysts are active for more demanding catalytic transformations. 
Second, it would be of interest to evaluate the properties of or- 
ganoactinide catalysts derived from precursors having greater 
coordinative unsaturation and/or offering the potential for more 
coordinatively unsaturated adsorbate structures. We report here 
a detailed study of the scope, regiochemistry, kinetics, and 
mechanism of arene hydrogenation catalyzed by a series of s u p  
ported organothorium complexes. Arene hydrogenation is a 
particularly demanding transformation in homogeneous solu- 
tion,"-15 and in several cases the mechanism has been argued to 
involve oxidative addition/reductive elimination sequences at single 
molecular sites. Arene hydrogenation pathways catalyzed by 
typical heterogenous platinum metal catalysts likely involve 
multiple metal sites and formal shuttling between metal oxidation 
states (e.g., in dissociative H2 
chemisorption).16J7 In 
contrast, 
supported organothorium complexes would appear to offer no 
possibility for oxidation state shuttling nor for classical metal 
cluster coordination effects. Nevertheless, it will be seen that 
supported organothorium complexes form the basis for a broad 
class of arene hydrogenation catalysts with Th($-allyl)4/DA 
rivalling the most active platinum metal catalysts in activity. 
Experimental Section 
All procedures were performed in Schlenk-type glassware interfaced 
to a high-vacuum (10-5-104 Torr) line or in a nitrogen-filled Vacuum 
Atmosphere glovebox equipped with an efficient recirculating atmosphere 
purification system (typically 0.5-1.0 ppm of 0,). 
Argon (Matheson, 
prepurified) was further purified by passage through MnO/vermiculite 
and Davison 4A molecular sieves. Deuterium (Matheson) was purified 
by passing through a 77 K stainless steel column filled with silica 
(Davison 62) which had been heated in a helium stream at 120 OC for 
1.0 h. Hydrogen (Matheson U.H.P.) was used as received. Naphthalene 
(Aldrich) was purified by three consecutive vacuum sublimations and was 
stored in a storage tube in the glovebox. ThCI4.3THF was prepared by 
the recrystallization of ThC14 
(Cerac) from THF at room temperature.I8

Allylmagnesium bromide (Aldrich) was used as received. 
Pentane 
(Aldrich, HPLC grade), toluene (Aldrich), benzene (Aldrich), and p- 
xylene (Aldrich) were distilled from Na/K alloy and were stored in vacuo 
over Na/K in bulbs on the vacuum h e .  Be11Zene-d6 and toluene-d8

and was stored in vacuum-tight storage tubes 
under an inert nitrogen atmosphere at -20 OC. 
Synthesis of Th($-C$I5), (3). In 
the glovebox, 700 mg (1.19 mmol) 
of ThCI4.3THF was loaded into the 5

container of R two-sided 
fritted reaction vessel fritted with a Teflon valve side arm. At -78 O C ,  
25 mL of diethyl ether was condensed onto the white crystals, and then 
under an argon flush, a solution of allylmagnesium bromide (7.5 mL of 
a 1 M solution in diethyl ether; 7.15 mmol) was syringed onto the sus- 
pension. A yellow coloration was evident immediately upon 
the addition. 
The yellow solution was stirred at -78 O
C
 for 1 h and then an additional 
24 h at -20 O
C
 to ensure completion of the reaction. The solvent was 
next removed at -20 O
C
 in vacuo, and the resulting solids were extracted 
at -20 "C with 25 mL of diethyl ether. Following cold filtration, the 
filtrate was evaporated in vacuo at -20 O
C
 and the residue extracted with 
3 X 25 mL of toluene at -20 OC. The yellow extract was filtered and 
the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo at -20 "C (requiring 16 h). The 
resulting yellow residue was then extracted with 3 X 25 mL of pentane, 
the solution filtered, and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo at -20 OC. 
Using this procedure, no 
evidence of diethyl ether or T H F  
was observed 
by 'H N M R  spectroscopy. Since T ~ ( T ' - C ' H ~ ) ~  
decomposes at 0 OC 
(forming a brown precipitate), it is necessary to perform all the above 
procedures at -20 OC. NMR samples were prepared by syringe transfer 
of an aliquot of a precooled solution of the complex in toluene-d8 into a 
cooled J-Young 
NMR tube under an argon flush. 'H NMR (400 MHz,

Impregnation of Supports with Organoactinide 
Complexes. In 
a two- 
sided fritted reaction vessel interfaced to the high-vacuum line, a cooled 
pentane solution containing a carefully measured quantity of the orga- 
noactinide complex of interest was filtered onto a carefully weighted 
quantity of support. The resulting slurry was next stirred for 30 min and 
filtered and the impregnated support was collected on 
the glass frit. The 
catalyst was then washed by transferring pentane from the filtrate to the 
chilled catalyst zone by distillation in vacuo, followed by suction filtration. 
This washing operation was repeated three times, and the sample was 
then dried in vacuo.

Griffin-Worden quartz medium pressure reactor (Kontes 
Corp., Vineland, NJ) having a two-port head and connected to a 500-mL 
metal gas ballast tank was flamed under high vacuum and charged in the 
glovebox with 80 mg of T ~ ( T ) - C ' H ~ ) ~ / D A  
(3.2 X IOd mol of Th). A 
magnetic stir bar was next introduced, and the apparatus was removed 
from the glovebox and attached to the high-vacuum line. After thorough 
evacuation (IO4 Torr), 1.0 mL (1.1 X IO-, mmol) of freshly distilled 
C6H6 was transferred under vacuum at -78 OC onto the supported or- 
ganoactinide. The reactor was warmed to room temperature and pres- 
surized to 190 psi of H2. The reactor was then immersed in a thermo- 
stated oil bath maintained at 90 * 
0.1 O
C
 and stirred rapidly (800 rpm). 
Control experiments showed that kinetic measurements (vide infra) were 
not influenced by H2 
mass transfer effects at stirring velocities greater 
than -400 rpm. The decrease in H 2  
pressure was measured with an 
Omega Engineering PX425-300GV digital pressure transducer. 
Kinetic Measurements. The constant volume, pseudo-constant pres- 
sure hydrogenation apparatus described above was used for all kinetic 
measurements. Determination of the kinetic order in H, pressure in- 
volved the use of large quantities of the arene and a ballast at varying 
high H, pressures for refilling the Griffin-Worden vessel after each ki- 
netic measurement. The change in H2 
pressure over the course of any 
kinetic run 
was usually less than S%. In 
variable PH2 
sequences, kinetic 
data were taken on 
the same catalyst sample, and the hydrogen pressure 
was deliberately made the same in the first and last set of measurements 
to check for possible catalyst deactivation (none was observed). The 
quantity of the arene consumed in a series of variable PH2 
runs 
was not 
greater than 10%. The kinetic order in the arene substrate was deter-

Instrumentation. ’H 
and l3C NMR spectroscopic experiments were 
performed with a Varian XL-400 or a Varian Gemini 300 instrument. 
Spectral simulations were carried aut with the Varian program SPINS, 
Version 5.1. ‘HID] 
NMR measurements were performed with a General 
Electric G N  500-MHz instrument at the University of Illinois, Urba- 
na-Champaign. Mass spectrometry was carried out with a VG702505E 
high-resolution mass spectrometer which was interfaced to a Hewlett- 
Packard 5980 gas chromatograph unit using a 15-m standard narrow 
bore dB-1 fused silica capillary column. ESR analyses were performed 
at 77 K with a Varian E-4 spectrometer, and ‘spin counting” experiments 
employed standard procedures.20 ICP measurements were performed 
with a Thermo Jarrell Ash Atom Scan 25 spectrometer. The loading of 
the organometallic complexes on DA (Th:AI ratio) was measured by 
digestion at 100 ‘C for 12 h of a known amount of the supported catalyst 
in a closed 60-mL Teflon vessel filled with 1O:l HF:HCI solution. 
Typical loadings were 4 X 
mol of Th/mg of DA (0.084.15 mole- 
cules/ 100 A*). The same determination found negligible quantities of 
Mg in the catalyst samples prepared from Th(~j’-c’H~)~. 
XPS Experiments. In 
the glovebox, 
a sample of Th($-allyl)4/DA was 
pulverized and pressed into a piece of In 
foil (Aldrich, 99.9992,O.l-mm 
thickness) and wrapped around a stainless steel sample stub. The sample 
was then loaded into a portable sample transfer chamber equipped with 
a load lock system for high-vacuum specimen transfer into the sample 
chamber of the VG XPS/SIMS instrument. Spectra were calibrated 
versus the C 1s signal.

The surface of dehydroxylated alumina (DA; yA1203

droxylated at 925 O
C
 under flowing He; 160 m2/g) is principally 
composed of ca. 5.5 02- 
(strong Lewis base), ca. 5.5 exposed M3+ 
(strong Lewis acid), and ca. 0.12 residual OH (weak Br~nsted 
acid) functionalities per 100 
A2.498*24 
Supported organothorium 
catalysts were prepared by impregnating DA with a stirring 
pentane solution of the complex of interest at -20 OC. The catalyst 
was collected by filtration and washed by soxhlet extraction with 
pentane at room temperature to remove any physisorbed material. 
The quantity of Th incorporated on 
the support in the absorption 
process was determined (A 1%) by digesting impregnated DA 
samples and measuring the Th and A1 content by ICP spectros- 
copy. Organothorium loadings were in the range of 2-4 X 
mol of Th/mg of DA (-0.084.15 molecules/l00 A2). Because 
of the low coverages, adsorbate resonances could not be observed 
in 13C 
CP-MAS NMR experiments. As already noted, the ab- 
sorption of Cp;ThR2 complexes on 
DA involves hydrocarbide 
moiety transfer from the organometallic complex to Lewis acid 
sites on 
the surface (eq 
1). We presume T ~ ( V ’ - C ~ H ~ ) ~

proceeds via a similar pathway (e.g., eq 5). In a similar manner,

Catalytic Activity of Supported Organothorium Complexes. 
Initial 
Obsenatioos. As reported previously,4 l/DA is highly active 
for ethylene polymerization and propylene hydrogenation. The 
latter reaction rate at -63 O
C
 is near the limit which is accurately 
measurable in the plug-flow reactor utilized. Catalyst 1/DA is 
not active for propylene polymerization. While survey experiments 
indicated that the catalytic properties of 2/DA are similar 
to those 
of l/DA, 3/DA behaves rather differently. Thus, 
3/DA catalyzes 
the rapid hydrogenation of propene in a plug-flow reactor (Nt = 
25 s-l at 25 “C), mediates the rapid polymerization of propene 
at room temperature to yield atactic (by I3C 
NMR) polypropylene, 
and catalyzes the rapid hydrogenation of sterically more encum- 
bered olefins (e.g., cyclohexene, 1,3-~yclohexadiene) 
in slurry 
reactions at room temperature. Under the present catalytic 
conditions (90 OC, 190 psi of H2-vide infra), we find Nt for 
cyclohexene hydrogenation by 3/DA to be >540000 h-I. From 
what is known from related homogeneous early transition metallDJ5 
and organo-f-element c a t a l y s i ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~  
the cyclohexene and cyclo- 
hexadiene transformations can be considered to be sterically rather 
demanding. 
Arene hydrogenation using the supported organothorium 
catalysts was studied in vigorously stirred non-mass transfer 
limited26c,28 
slurry reactions. The ballasted constant volume, 
pseudo-constant pressure reactor2“ allowed accurate monitoring 
of reaction rates (turnover frequencies, N1) 
via the change in H2

I/DA. Analysis of reaction mixtures at various stages 
of conversion by GC-MS indicated that any partially hydrogenated 
products (cyclohexadiene, cjclohexene) were present at concen- 
trations below the detection limit (I 
0.0001% of benzene or 
cyclohexane). This behavior can 
be contrasted with that of many 
conventional 
heterogeneous benzene hydrogenation catalysts where 
cyclohexene can be detected at partial conversions.16 In 
Table 
I, the rates of the present transformations are compared to those 
known transition metal homogeneous' 
and heterogene~us'~,~' 
benzene hydrogenation catalysts. Heterogeneous turnover fre- 
quency data are normalized per active metal site where such 
information is available. It can be seen that the benzene hy- 
drogenation activity of 3/DA is far greater than that of the known 
homogeneous catalysts and appears to rival or e x d  
those of the 
most active heterogeneous systems. In 
contrast to these obser- 
vations, catalytic hydrogenation experiments with solutions of 3 
yielded only propene, wi;h negligible activity for either homo- 
geneous olefin or arene reduction.

geneous systems, deviations from all-cis Hz 
delivery can usually 
be correlated with the presence of unbound, partially reduced 
intermediates, i.e., with dissociation and recoordination of partially 
reduced species.'6 The present 3/DA-derived naphthalene product 
mix is also not exceptional for a conventional heterogeneous 
catalyst.16 When a 1:l benzenep-xylene mixture is hydrogenated 
with 3/DA, there is essentially complete (97:3) 
selectivity to 
cyclohexane, 
before pxylene conversion becomes significant (Table 
11). The regiochemistry of p-xylene reduction in this experiment 
is indentical to that for neat p-xylene. In 
regard to kinetics, the 
initial turnover frequency is comparable to that for neat benzene, 
while Nt 
after benzene consumption is comparable to that for neat 
p-xylene (Table 11). Further mechanistic details will be taken 
up in the kinetic analysis (vide infra). 
Experiments with benzene and D2 
indicate by GC-MS and 
NMR that C6H6D6 is the exclusive reduction product. Analysis 
of partially converted reaction mixtures gives no evidence of 
partially reduced species nor of C-H/C-D exchange in the un- 
converted benzene. Interestingly, C-H/C-D exchange is observed 
over longer time periods in the cyclohexane products-vide 
infra.

temperature I3C

ring is rapidly inverting) of product C6H6D6 samples indicate that

(Figures 3, spectra C, D, and E, respectively). Although the 
chemistry that would lead to such D2 addition sequences is not 
immediately obvious, it can be seen 
that such regiosomers cannot 
be major components of the present C6H6D6 product mix. 
Although C6H6D6 
is the exclusive product of the 3/DA-cata- 
lyzed C6H6 + D2 
addition reaction at the point where D2 
uptake 
is complete, reaction for an additional 12 h at 90 OC with 45 psi 
of D2 
residual pressure after complete substrate reduction yields 
cyclohexane isotopomers evidencing additional D incorporation 
(Figure 4). Since the equivalents of available C-H in the sample 
shown were ca. 3X the available equivalents of gaseous D, any 
products, as is in fact observed (Figure 4C). In the case of 
catalytic toluene + D2 
reduction, I3C NMR and GC-MS show 
that extensive C-H/C-D scrambing occurs at the benzylic pos- 
itions of the unconverted substrate unlike the benzene reduction. 
DA alone is found not to catalyze these reactions under the 
conditions employed.

lished that the stirring of the reaction mixture was sufficiently 
rapid to eliminate H2 
mass transfer effects in the kinetic data. 
Studies of benzene hydrogenation showed that the rate is zero- 
order in substrate (time-independent Nt) over a wide benzene 
concentration range (Figure 5A) and first-order in H2 
pressure 
over a wide PH, 
range (Figure 5B). Parallel kinetic isotope (KIE) 
effect studies using D2 
yield Nl(H2)/Nt(D2) 
= 3.5 f

kinetics of benzene hydrogenation were also studied as a function 
of temperature, and an Arrhenius plot is shown in Figure 6. 
Least-squares analysis of these data yields E, = 16.0 f 
0.3 
kcal/mol. A similar kinetic study of p-xylene hydrogenation was 
also carried out. As can be seen in Figure 7, the reaction is again 
zero order in substrate over a wide concentration range. In 
the 
case of 1 
: 
1 benzene-p-xylene mixtures, the benzene is a strong 
inhibitor of the xylene hydrogenation, and even though the 
turnover frequency ratios of the neat substrates is 4.7:l (Table 
I), the product mix is 97:3 cyclohexanedimethylcyclohexane at 
the pint of complete benzene conversion. As 
can be seen 
in Figure 
8, the kinetics of the mixture reduction are approximately zero- 
order in substrate in each regime where the turnover involves 
predominant reduction of a single substrate.

probes were employed to determine the maximum 
percentage of the Th(~$allyl)~/DA 
sites which are catalytically 
significant in arene hydrogenation and to assess the chemical 
nature of these sites. A poisoning experiment was first carried 
out in which the 3/DA catalyst was operated through part of a 
standard slurry benzene hydrogenation cycle. Nt was determined, 
and then a measured aliquot of degassed D20 
in C6H634 
(D20/Th 
= 0.040) was injected using a gas-tight high-pressure syringe 
through a high-pressure port i
n
 the reactor head. Catalytic activity 
was then measured for 60 min (kinetics remained zero-order in 
substrate), and Nt was found to have dropped by 50%. This 
procedure was then repeated with D,O/Th = 0.020, and Nl was 
found to have dropped an additional 25% (the kinetics remained 
zero order in benzene). An additional injection (D20/Th = 0.010) 
further reduced N, to 12.5% of the original valve. From these 
results, it can be estimated that a maximum of 8 f 
1% of the 
3/DA sites are of catalytic importance in benzene hydrogenation 
and that kinetically these respond identically to D 2 0  
poisoning. 
This result and other assays which detect Th-H/Th-hydrocarbyl 
functionalities (vide infra) suggest that the D 2 0  
poisoning process 
involves protonolytic interception of Th-H or Th-hydrocarbyl 
bonds34 
(e.g., eq 6 or variants in which greater than one hydride 
ligand undergoes protonolysis). GC-MS analysis of the reaction 
mixture subsequent to D 2 0  
quenching indicated that the quantity 
of labeled RD products was below the detection limit.

organic components revealed exclusive propane formation (<1% 
propene). The propane/Th ratio was determined to be 10 f 
2%. 
This result is in good agreement with the catalytic poisoning assay 
and is in accord with hydrogenolytic/hydrogenative

a very active catalyst for propene hydrogenation (Nt -

assay surface Th-H was to flush a 3/DA catalyst in a plug-flow 
reactor with H2 
(25 “C) and then He (25 “C) and finally to dose 
the catalyst bed with measured amounts of CH3C1 (which is 
rapidly reduced by Th-H groups35c). The evolved CH4/Th was

is in good accord with the coverage deduced from the D 2 0

of the solid catalyst to flowing H2

high vacuum significantly alters this result. XPS studies of several

strumentation equipped with an inert atmosphere entry port. Th

of eq 10, Le., saturation kinetics are observed at higher H2 
pressures.4b Neither olefin insertion (step 1) nor hydrogenolysis 
(step 2) is operationally reversible or strictly turnover-limiting, 
D2 
delivery to propene is rigorously 1,2, and Nt(H2)/Nt(D2) 
= 
1.5 (fO.l) for propene (-63 “C) and 2.0 (f0.2) for isobutene (0 
“C). Arrhenius activation energies (kcal/mol) are 3.6 (f0.2) 
(propene) and 5.3 (f0.2) (isobutene). 
In contrast to the relatively straightforward sequence of 
well-precedented steps involved in Th(1V)-centered olefin hy- 
drogenation catalysis, those which would effect the hydrogenation 
of arena have less precedent. In advancing a mechanistic s ~ e ~ r i o ,  
we make the following two chemically reasonable assumptions: 
(i) Th remains in the +4 oxidation state at all times, (ii) the 
catalysis occurs at single Th surface sites. The first assumption 
is reasonable in view of the great difficulty in reducing Th(IV)38 
(only a few Th(II1) compounds are known and none in lower 
oxidation states), the present surface spectroscopic observations, 
and the impossibility of higher Th oxidation states. The second 
assumption is reasonable in view of the large dispersion of Th sites 
on 
the surface and the small percentage of active sites. Neither 
oxidative addition/reduction elimination reactivity sequences nor 
multimetallic substrate activation/reduction have precedent in 
organothorium chemistry. 
The mechanistic sequence shown in Scheme I11 offers many 
attractive features in portraying a pathway for arene hydrogen- 
ation. Steps 1 and 2 are in essence a more elaborate variant of 
well-known olefin insertion processes into Th-H bonds29335 
(eq 11). 
Such additions are usually exothermic for f-element complexes 
(in contrast to many middle and late transition metal comple~es).~~ 
Moreover, in the present case, the coordinatively unsaturated 
insertion product should be stabilized by polyhapto pentadienyl 
ligation-an amply precedented coordination mode for f-element 
and early transition  element^.^^^' Hydrogenation (step 3) would

yield a butadiene complex, for which there is some precedent in 
organothorium chemistry.42 Since this is a Th( 
IV) butadiene 
complex, rapid insertion (step 4) to yield a precedented q3-allyl 
does not seem unlikely. In regard to regiochemistry, the met- 
al-centered character of f-element hydrocarbyl hydrogenolysis 
p r o c e s ~ e s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
(eq 12) argues that hydrogen delivery processes 
would be to the same side of the carbocyclic ring as the coordinated 
Th ion. The steps from the q3-allyl to hydride and cycloalkane 
have precedent in that Cp’,Ln(q3-allyl) complexes undergo rapid 
hydrogenolysis 
to yield alkanes and the corresponding (Cp’,LnH), 
derivatives.26 Furthermore, steps 6 and 7 are well-known reaction 
patterns in organothorium ~ h e m i s t r y . ~ ’ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
In 
support of the 
overall step 4-7 sequence, Cp’,Th(butadiene) has been shown to 
undergo rapid hydrogenation to yield (CP’,T~H~)~ 
and 
Thus, many of the structures and transformations in Scheme I11 
have firm precedent or close analogues. 
In 
regard to the kinetics of Th(q3-allyl),/DA-catalyzed arene 
hydrogenation, the present study shows benzene turnover to be 
zero-order in arene over a wide arene concentration range and 
first-order in PH2 
(eq 13) over a .wide H2 
pressure range, with a 
KIE of N,(H2)/N,(D2) = 3.5 f 
0.3. These results introduce 
significant constraints regarding the probable sequence of events 
in Scheme 111. Thus, initial arene binding must be rapid and 
essentially irreversible. Whether arene activation proceeds via

cussion has of course ignored the possibility that one or more rapid, 
irreversible H2 
addition steps to form q2-H2 
complexes45 
could 
come early in Scheme 111 (e.g., preceding step 1). These would 
then exhibit zero-order kinetics in P
,
,
,
 and the bound H2 
could 
then be transferred to the carbocyclic substrate in a series of 
intramolecular steps, with some later addition of exogenous H2 
being turnover-limiting. This scenario requires the formation of 
do, 
fo q2-H2 
complexes, for which there is little precedent. Such 
species could not be detected in Cp’2ThX2/Cp’2UX236a 
systems, 
and the only identification (Cp’,Eu+-H2)* 
indicates the binding 
to be weak and labile. Moreover, it is not clear why such binding 
would be favored over that of the more basic arene, which is 
present in far higher concentration. In 
the absence of compelling 
evidence for Th(q2-H2) 
complexes, 
this alternative possibility seems 
best held in abeyance. 
The studies of benzene + 
D2 
and pxylene + 
H2 
regiochemistry 
indicate that H2/D2 
delivery is not to a single arene face. The 
most reasonable accommodation of these facts would be disso- 
ciation/reassociation of the partially reduced arenes, possibly at 
the diene (after step 3) or olefin (after step 5) stage. Since neither 
free dienes not olefins are detected in partially converted reactions, 
the binding of these species must be relatively strong. In 
control 
experiments (vide supra) it was found that cyclohexene hydro- 
genation is far more rapid (>20X) than that of benzene under

partially hydrogenation intermediate species would reasonably 
be expected to be very small. Alternatively, it is conceivable that 
the substrate fragment remains in the Th coordination sphere

interactions (e.g., eq 17).

The experiments relating to the hydrogenation of the benz- 
ene-p-xylene mixture are also informative about processes at the 
active site. The initial catalytic turnover frequency is indistin- 
guishable from that for neat benzene, and the kinetics are es- 
sentially zero order (Figure 8). At the point of complete benzene 
conversion, the cyclohexane-dimethylcyclohexane ratio is 97:3. 
The kinetics for subsequent p-xylene hydrogenation are also es- 
sentially zero-order in substrate, and the turnover frequency is 
also identical within experimental error to that of neat p-xylene 
(Table 11). Furthermore, the stereochemistry of pxylene reduction 
is identical to that in neat substrate hydrogenation. Assuming 
that arene adsorption is not competitive with H2 
adsorption (in- 
deed, H2 
activation is likely to be Rideal-Eley-like and not involve 
dissociative adsorption36b) 
and that arene adsorption conforms to 
a simple Langmuir isotherm with rapid, strong arene binding,16a 
the rate of benzene hydrogenation via steps 1-3 in Scheme 111 
can be expressed as in eq 18 (a variant of eq 13), where ub is the 
rateb = uSb[H2] 
(18) 
rate constant and Kb is the equilibrium constant for benzene 
binding. Assuming benzene and p-xylene compete for the same 
adsorptionfhydrogenation sites, that site equilibration between 
the two substrates is more rapid than hydrogenation, and that the 
basic tenets of Scheme 1
1

 also obtain for p-xylene reduction, the 
relative rates of benzene and p-xylene hydrogenation can be ex- 
pressed as in eq 19, where the subscript x refers topxylene. Using

After the completion of 3/DA-catalyzed benzene hydrogena- 
tion, evidence of facile C-H/C-D scrambling processes was also 
noted in the cyclohexane product. The most likely mechanism 
is operation of the reverse of step 7 in Scheme 1

Nature of the Catalytically Active Site(s). The present results 
indicate that a maximum of 8 f 
1% of the surface organothorium 
sites are of catalytic significance. From previous surface spec- 
troscopic and solution phase model compound studies, it seems 
reasonable to assume that the Th(q3-allyl), adsorption/activation 
process involves allyl anion transfer to coordinatively unsaturated 
surface A13+ sites resulting in cation-like organothorium centers 
(e.g., eqs 1 and 5). Poisoning experiments indicate a kinetically 
homogeneous response of the surface sites with respect to pro- 
tonolysis, with the number of ligand sites titrated in agreement 
with those assayed by allyl hydrogenolysis and CH3Cl dosing (eqs 
6-8). Since the latter two 
probes assay Th-H sites created, the 
simplest model of the active site could be a structure such as E.5o

ligand per Th site, resulting in the less coordinatively saturated 
structures F 
and C, 
which would presumably be detected in the

Th-H assay. However, to be stoichiometrically compatible 
with the D 2 0  
poisoning results, this scenario requires that Th-H 
deuterolysis be random and the species such as C,

(50) Since step 5 in Scheme I11 portrays the hydrogenolysis of an q3-allyl 
to a hydride, the stability of the allyl groups in E 
would necessarily reflect 
a minimum coordination number which was energetically accessible and/or 
unique steric environments. In an operating catalyst, these might eventually 
be replaced by qj-hexenyl ligands.

While there is some evidence that Cp',Th(OR)-R hydrogenolysis 
is accelerated by polar solvents,29 
such effects are at present 
speculative for metal oxide-supported catalysts. 
Comparison to Known Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Cat- 
alysts. Typical homogeneous transition metal arene hydrogenation 
catalysts are characterized by relatively low activities (see Table 
I) and, in some cases, by short catalyst lifetimes. In all instances, 
the catalytic cycles are believed to involve either t ~ o ~ ~ J ~ 9 ~ ~ * ' ~  
or 
one-electron13 
oxidation state shuttling at a single metal center. 
In the one case1% 
where a detailed kinetic study was conducted, 
the catalysis is first-order in arene and zero-order in H2. Where 
investigated, the homogeneous catalysts 
are generally more active 
for olefin than for arene hydrogenation, 
and arene hydrogenation 
activities decrease with increasing arene substitution." Several 
of these systems are capable of reducing ketones and nitriles, while 
in several cases, only polycyclic but not monocyclic arenes can 
be hydrogenated.I2 Several of the homogeneous catalysts exhibit 
remarkably high regiospecificity, with H2 
being delivered to only 
a single arene face.I1J4J5 Most of these catalysts exhibit some 
degree 
of functional group tolerance, which in some cases 
includes 
ethers, esters, and ketones. None appear to exhibit activity for 
olefin polymerization. Needless to say, separation of products 
and catalysts may be inefficient. 
Typical supported metal hetergeneous arene hydrogenation 
catalysts exhibit high turnover frequencies and long lifetimes.I6 
Turnover frequencies generally fall with increasing arene sub- 
stitution, and rate laws are usually zero-order in arene and 
first-order in H2.16 To our knowledge, hydrogenation 
selectivities 
of the magnitude exhibited by 3/DA with respect to benzene versus 
pxylene are not observed. In the heterogeneous systems, delivery 
of H2 
is seldom exclusively to a single substrate face, and partially 
hydrogenated products are usually detectable in incompletely 
converted reaction mixtures.'6 Functional group tolerance depends 
on the nature of the catalyst, and selective poisoning by various 
functional groups or impurities can alter the chemo- or regiose- 
Eisen and Marks 
lectivity of a catalyst. Separation of products and catalysts is 
usually straightforward. 
The organothorium molecule-based supported catalysts as ex- 
emplified by Th(~~-allyl)~/DA 
present an interesting 
contrast to 
both conventional homogeneous and heterogeneous arene hy- 
drogenation catalysts. While the molecular nature of the observed 
chemical transformations and substrate selectivities are similar 
to those of the transition metal homogeneous catalysts, the very 
high turnover frequencies and lack of obvious oxidative addi- 
tion/reductive elimination pathways stand in sharp contrast. 
Likewise, the differences in regioselectivity, olefin polymerization 
activity, and likely tolerance of polar functional groups differ 
greatly between homogeneous transition metal and supported 
organothorium catalysts. While the supported organothorium 
systems are similar to conventional heterogeneous arene reduction 
catalysts in rate law, regiospecificity, and substrate selectivity, 
the molecular-level nature of the transformations (single site verus 
multimetal ensembles) must surely be different, as is functional 
group tolerance and olefin polymerization activity. Future research 
will continue to explore the scope 
and mechanisms of catalytic 
transformations possible at unsaturated, supported organo-f-ele- 
ment centers, as well as the investigation of homogeneous ana- 
logues.
