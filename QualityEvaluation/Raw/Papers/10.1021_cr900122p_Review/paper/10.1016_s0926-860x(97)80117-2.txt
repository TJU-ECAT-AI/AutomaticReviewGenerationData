(hydroformylation, synthesis of acetic acid and related topics). Some minor criticism may be 
expressed as little emphasis is given to asymmetric hydroformylation as the usefulness of 
developing detailed kinetic expressions is of little value for most readers. However, the 
extensive documentation of the whole chapter is a firm positive aspect. 
Chapter 2.2 deals with hydrogenation centred on the attractive enantioselective induction 
by organometallic compounds. Chapter 2.3 focuses on the application of catalysis by 
organomstallics to polymerizations (homo-, oligo-, co-polymerization, metathesis, telomeri- 
zation). The importance of these processes is emphasised, e.g. cyclooligomerizations and 
the relatively recent development of carbon monoxide copolymerizations. Chapter 2.4 
encompasses the vast field of oxidations with interesting aspects concerning more specific 
topics such as the synthesis of oxirane sand quinones. Chapters 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 cover 
hydrocyanation, hydrosilylation and hydroamination with recent developments in these well 
known processes. Volume 1 
ends 
with selected important examples of asymmetric syntheses 
highlighting the implementation of organometallic strategies. 
Volume 2 begins (Chapter 3.1) with recent views about methods of organometallic 
chemistry (immobilization of catalyst, molecular modelling, new analytical methods in detect- 
ing intermediates, development of multifunctional catalysts). Chapter 3.2 introduces new 
processes based on biotransformations (however, some doubt is justified about the relev- 
ance within the context of the subject of this handbook despite its great interest), use of 
host-guest chemistry and membrane reactors, phase transfer catalysis, electrocatalysis, 
etc.). Chapter 3.3 details peculiar 
aspects (some are remarkably presented) of organometallic 
catalysis applied to asymmetric dihydroxylations, hydrovinylations, Pauson-Khand reac- 
tions, to carbon dioxide 
chemistry, C-H activation of alkanes, homogeneous 
catalysis 
in living 
cells. Some of the most promising aspects of organometaUic catalysis presented in the 
aforementioned chapters are developed in the conclusion and important points addressed 
for the future. 
Overall, this two-volume handbook is a highly informative review of the fascinating field of 
organometallic catalysis. Its usefulness is serf-evident and should drive any scientist more or 
less involved to put it in good place into his library.

Science and Technology in Catalysis 1994 (Stud. Surf. ScL CataL Volume 92), by Y. 
Izumi, H. Arai and M. Iwamoto (Editors), Elsevier Science BV, Amsterdam, 1995, 
ISBN 0-444-82189-9, 496 pp., f495.00/$291.25. 
In 1990 the Catalysis Society of Japan embarked on a new series of international 
conferences, the Tokyo Conference on Advanced Catalysis Science and Technology 
(TOCAI'). The 
TOCAT 2 Conference held in 1994 
was attended by 500 participants, presenting 
a total of 183 papers. Full texts of the contributions, 7 plenary lectures and 78 papers 
presented orally and as posters, were included in this volume of the Studies in Surface 
Science and Catalysis series, copublished by Kodasha Ltd., Tokyo and Elsevier Science 
B.V., Amsterdam. 
The plenary lectures outline the most important targets in catalysis analyzed both from 
academic and industrial points of views. Besides these, the reader will find in the parts of the 
256 
book devoted to original contributions a very broad spectrum of topics, particularly in those 
fields which are of interest and of need to the industry. 
'Catalysis in the 21th Century: The Next Frontier' by J.A. Cusumano from Catalytica, Inc., 
USA, addresses that catalysis is able to provide society with its basic needs -- health care, 
food supply, energy and materials. With the worldwide economy growth the reduction of 
industry waste and/or abatement of pollutants are main targets of catalysis nowadays. As 
examples were presented (i) catalytic combustion on Pd-PdO, preventing NOx formation, 
(ii) selective oxidations particularly of low paraffins including methane, (iii) introduction of 
redox sites (e.g. Ti) in silicate molecular sieves 
for hydrocarbon oxidations by H202 replacing 
homogeneous oxidations 
and producing awide range of oxygenates, controlled in selectivity 
by the pore size of the molecular sieve matrix, (iv) replacement of hazardous strong liquid 
acids in processes of alkylation and isomerizstion of paraffins in gasoline pools. Last but not 
least high impact of catalysis is expected in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals synthesis; 
it is particularly foreseen in chirally pure drugs. The final part of the paper outlined in detail 
future opportunities for catalysis in the 21th century up to the year 2040, ranging from 
nowadays well-known catalysis 
targets up to hydrogen economy, biofeedstocks and chemi- 
cals produced in plants. 
'M41S: a New Family of Mesoporous Molecular Sieves Prepared with Liquid Crystal 
Templates' by C.T. Kresge et al. from Mobil Research and Development Corporation ad- 
dresses peculiarities in the synthesis of mesoporous materials ranging in inner channel 
diameter from 15 to 100, particularly of hexagonal MCM-41 and of cubic MCM-48 by using 
cationic surfactants 
as 
the structure 
directing agents. Expectations 
are high 
to use in 
the future 
the inner 
volume of these mesoporous matrices as catalyst carriers 
for transformation of bulky 
organic molecules which cannot enter 'so called' large or medium pore zeolitic molecular 
sieves. 
'Ion Support Interactions and Catalysis' by M. Che and Y.G. Shul from Universit(~ 
P. et M. 
Curie, Paris, indicates the importance of metal-ion-support interactions (ISI) occurring in 
numerous 'active phase' supported materials. The review includes the structure and related 
properties of single metal ions coordinated in various positions of molecular sieve matrices, 
single and well dispersed ions, monolayers and clusters up to tri-dimensional oxides and 
intermediate compounds on amorphous carriers. The consequences of these structures 
with 
ISl for the properties and catalysis of the resulting material are shown in various examples. 
'Catalysis with TS-1: New Perspectives 
for the Industrial Use of Hydrogen Peroxide' by G. 
Bellussi et el. from Eniricerche, S.p.A., Italy. TS-1, a silicate with MFI structure containing 
medium size channels and Ti isomorphously substituted in the tetrahedrally coordinated 
silicate framework, has for a decade been known as unusual oxidation catalyst for hydrocar- 
bons employing hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. As H202 is rather expensive 
the Eniricerche 
team developed and reports a new sophisticated metal-ion-silicate catalyst (Pd or Pt-Ti-sili- 
cate with MFI structure) utilizing the functions of Pd (Pt) to form in situ H202 from hydrogen 
and oxygen and to apply it in subsequent oxidation processes of various alkanes, alkenes, 
phenol etc. Antraquinone is considered to be the most suitable solvent. 
'MT-Chlor Process and its Application to the Global Environment' by Y. Tozuka, Mitsui 
Toatsu Chemicals, Inc., Japan. The increasing production of organic compounds via chlori- 
nated compounds steadily increases the production of hydrogen chloride. Therefore, a 
257 
proper process for recovery of chlorine from HCI is necessary. Besides expensive electro- 
chemical processes, catalytic oxidation was already invented in the 19th century. However, 
the disadvantage is a substantial sublimation of the active compound from the CuCI2- 
KCI/SiO2 catalyst. The presented advanced MT-chlor process employs a newly developed 
active chromia catalyst operating at low temperature and producing 99.5% pure chlorine from 
chlorinated units of organic compounds. 
'The Remarkable Role of Cations in Molecular Sieves' by J.N. Armor from Air Products 
and Chemicals, Inc., USA, addresses opportunities for the unusual redox behaviour of 
transition metal ions implanted particularly in high silica zeolitas to be utilized in redox catalysis 
in the field of deNOx processes and fine chemicals synthesis. The author stressed the need 
for research regarding the location of the cations and their local environment in the molecular 
sieve matrices, of the impact of the methods and ways of introducing cations with consider- 
ation of metal ion complexation in solutions used for ion exchange and of solid state ion 
exchange and related solid-state processes. Moreover, he raised the question what the rules 
are which govern cation exchange in high silica matrices. In addition, the mobility of cations 
in high silica zeolites, the formation and function of small 'precipitated' oxidic species in 
molecular sieves and their redox function are discussed, and the question is raised if there 
exists an interaction between the single cations and oxidic species. 
In 'Understanding Catalysis at the Molecular Level: Challenges and Perspectives' by A.T. 
Bell, University of California at Berkeley, the advances in molecular understanding of catalyst 
structure and structure vs. properties relationships are illustrated in the areas of Fischer- 
Tropsch synthesis, selective catalytic reduction of NO by ammonia and of zeolite synthesis. 
Mass transfer considerations in these procasses-procedures are included as well. It is shown 
how the basic knowledge on a molecular level of the structure and function of catalytic 
materials can be helpful in designing both the catalyst structure and the catalytic process. It 
is also shown that the synthesis of high silica zeolites can be directed to a desired structure 
of high crystallinity by investigations and understanding of the individual stages of nucleation 
and of the effect of various organic cations-templates. 
The next part contains original papers from academic laboratories. The topics of these 
papers are very diverse. They cover synthesis of catalysts, mostly molecular sieves (sub- 
stituted Cr, mesoporous molecular sieves, molybdenum oxicarbide) and as regards catalytic 
reactions methanol synthesis from CO2, catalytic CO hydrogenation using an organometallic 
approach, oxidative dehydrogenation, aromatization and selective oxidation of low paraffins 
(ethane, propane), and hydrodesulphurization processes. 
The last part of the volume consists of contributions from industry, where new or improved 
processes with respect to catalysts were presented. Attention was mainly paid to polymeri- 
zation, hydrogenation, desulphurization, and to NOx abatement processes in reducing and 
oxidizing atmosphere.
