Periodic DFT calculations of the stability of mononuclear and oligonuclear Ga-oxo cations in
mordenite (MOR) have been carried out. Independent of the aluminium distribution in the zeolite
framework the stability of cyclic Ga2O2
2+ ions is much higher than that of the isolated GaO+
(gallyl) ions in a high-silica mordenite (Si/Al = 23) model. As to the location of such dimers,
favorable tetrahedral coordination environment of Ga dominates over the necessity to
compensate the positive extraframework charges directly with proximate negative framework
charges. Charge alternation can occur in Ga2O2/MOR models in which positive charges of the
cationic complex are separated from the framework anionic sites. Oligomerization of four isolated
gallyl ions in a MOR model with Si/Al = 11 results in the formation of cubic Ga4O4
4+ ions.
Also in this case direct interaction of the cluster is limited to two anionic sites, while two other
framework [AlO2] units are signiﬁcantly remote. Binuclear sites are argued to account for the
enhanced activity of oxygenated gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation.
These sites, however, tend to decompose via water desorption upon the catalytic reaction resulting
in less reactive reduced Ga+ ions. As per predictions from the quantum-chemical calculations, the
experimental results show that the high alkane dehydrogenation activity can be maintained by
in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extraframework Ga species.
1.
Introduction
Chemical reactivity of zeolites can be tailored by the introduction
of extraframework metal-containing species in their micro-
porous space.1 These cations compensate the negative charge
of the lattice oxygen anions resulting from isomorphous
substitution of tetrahedrally coordinated framework silicon
with aluminium. The catalytic activity of the resulting zeolites
depends strongly on the metal and the structure of the cationic
metal-containing complex. Insight into the molecular structure
of the extraframework cations is needed to understand their
role in catalytic reactions. This however remains a challenge in
zeolite chemistry.
An adamant model for the location of extraframework
cations in the zeolite micropores is based on direct compensa-
tion of the negative zeolite framework charge by the positive
charges of these cations. Such a model can be straight-
forwardly accepted for univalent cations (e.g., H+, NH4
+,
Na+, K+). For cations of higher charge it requires close
proximity of the aluminium substitutions in the zeolite frame-
work. Whereas this condition is met in zeolites with a high
aluminium density such as faujasites, it generally is not in
high-silica zeolites such as ZSM-5 and mordenite.1 A useful
structural model includes then the presence of extraframework
oxygen-containing anions that coordinate to the metal (M),
resulting in the formation of multinuclear cationic complexes
with a formal charge of +1 such as [M3+ = O2]+,
[M2+–OH]+.
An alternative model involves indirect compensation of the
multiple-charged cations by distantly placed negative charges
of the zeolite lattice. An example is Zn/ZSM-5 zeolite where
part of the exchangeable cations is accommodated in such way
that the extraframework Zn2+ is located in the vicinity of a
single aluminium-occupied oxygen tetrahedron, whilst the
other framework anionic site required for the overall charge-
neutrality is at such a distance that it does not interact directly
with the extraframework positive charge.2,3 This results in
strong Lewis acidity of these sites, which is reﬂected by their
ability to dissociate H–H2,3 and C–H bonds4,5 under relatively
mild conditions. Another example occurs in Ga/ZSM-5 with
cationic [Ga2O2]2+ complexes being the active sites during
alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of water.6 In this case,
there seems to be a large energy gain in providing a tetrahedral
conﬁguration for Ga3+ over a trigonal one in GaO+ mono-
mers, which prevails over the energy loss due to the lack of
coordination to a zeolitic anionic site in the ﬁrst coordination
sphere of the cationic complex.7 One notes that indirect charge
compensation is not uncommon in coordination compounds
where a central metal ion is often surrounded by neutral
ligands, whilst the charge-compensating anions are located
outside the coordination shell.8 However, a ﬁrm theoretical
basis for indirect charge compensation in zeolites is lacking.

gallium-containing zeolites, this catalytic system provides a
suitable basis for a comparison of various charge-compensation
models based on quantum-chemical calculations. Conven-
tional methods of incorporation of metal ions into a zeolite
matrix oﬀer little control over the type of extraframework
species and very often a variety of structures is present in the
ﬁnal catalyst. Well-deﬁned Ga-containing zeolites can be
prepared via chemical vapour deposition of Ga(CH3)3 onto
acidic zeolites.11–13 The resulting grafted Ga(CH3)2
+ ions
can be transformed into the catalytically active Ga+ ions.
Experimental13 and theoretical14 works have indicated that the
latter cation is the dominant reactive species. Further treat-
ment of Ga+ with nitrous oxide gives rise to a remarkable
increase of the catalytic activity due to formation of the
oxygenated gallium species. The observation that one nitrous
oxide molecule is consumed upon oxidation, indicating
stoichiometric deposition of oxygen, led to the proposition
that the catalytically active oxygenated species is the gallyl ion,
GaO+.13
Although
such
mononuclear
ions
have
been
considered before in experimental13,15–17 and in computational
studies,18–21 recent theoretical results have clearly shown that
these sites cannot be responsible for catalytic activity in the
light alkane dehydrogenation.22 The reason is that the high
basicity of the terminal extraframework oxygen ion in GaO+
disfavors H2 recombination from the [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+
intermediate required to regenerate the active site. The reac-
tion pathway to Ga+ via elimination of water is more facile.
Although this mechanism explains the rapid deactivation of
the initially highly active oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite,13 the
complete analysis of the possible reaction mechanisms does
not provide an adequate explanation for the enhanced catalytic
activity
of
the
oxidized
catalyst.
An
alternative
inter-
pretation is the formation of oligomeric (GaO)n
n+ complexes.
The occurrence of cationic binuclear gallium–oxo clusters in
ZSM-5 has been supported by recent EXAFS measurements
and has been used to explain the enhancement of catalytic
activity of Ga/ZSM-5 upon water co-feeding.6 A recent
computational study shows that the large shift of the CO stretching
frequency observed in infrared spectra of oxidized catalysts
can only be explained by coordination of carbon monoxide to
small cationic gallium oxide clusters with relatively high
coordinative unsaturation of the Ga centers.23 Furthermore,
the possibility of formation and indirect charge-compensation
of binuclear Ga2O2
2+ cations in high-silica mordenite has
recently been reported by us.7
Herein we extend the quantum-chemical investigation of
stability and reactivity of multiple-charged cationic (GaO)n
n+
species. Special attention is devoted to the possibility of
formation of charge alternating structures in high-silica
zeolites and to the factors, which govern stability and reactivity
of
extraframework
metal-containing
cationic
species.

Computational details
Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)24 within density
functional theory (DFT) with the gradient-corrected PW9125
exchange–correlation functional. The projected augmented
wave (PAW) method26 was used to describe the electron–ion
interactions and for valence electrons a plane wave basis set
was employed. The energy cut-oﬀwas set to 400 eV. The
Brillouin zone sampling was restricted to the G point.27 Cell
parameters were initially optimized for the mordenite model.
The resulting parameters were then employed in further
calculations.
Full geometry optimizations were performed for each
structure with the ﬁxed optimized cell parameters using a
conjugated gradient algorithm. Convergence was assumed to
be reached when the forces on each atom were below 0.05 eV A
˚ 1.
The nudged elastic band (NEB) method28 with improved
tangent estimate was used to determine the minimum energy
path and the transition-state structures of the elementary
reactions involved in ethane dehydrogenation. The maximum
energy geometries following from the NEB method were then
optimized separately using a quasi-Newton algorithm. In this
step, the positions of the extraframework atoms and the atoms
of the adjacent framework oxygen tetrahedra were optimized,
while the positions of the remaining atoms were ﬁxed. The
nature of the stationary points was tested by analyzing
the calculated normal modes, which were computed using
the ﬁnite diﬀerence method as implemented in VASP. Small
displacements (0.02 A
˚ ) of atoms from the extraframework and
framework atoms sharing bonds were used for the estimation
of the numerical Hessian matrix. The rest of the framework
atoms were ﬁxed at their equilibrium positions.
As detailed, periodic DFT calculations of ZSM-5 zeolite are
currently prohibitive in terms of computer demand due to the
low symmetry and the large size of the MFI unit cell, we
choose mordenite as a model for a high-silica zeolite. Its purely
siliceous
structure
has
Cmcm
space
group
symmetry.
The orthorhombic cell of mordenite contains 144 atoms
(48 Si and 96 O).29 It is possible, however, to construct a smaller
monoclinic primitive cell of 72 atoms (24 Si and 48 O)30
(Fig. 1a). After optimizing the volume and shape, the para-
meters of the primitive cell are a = b = 13.648 A
˚ , c = 7.508 A
˚
and g = 971. They correspond to the cell parameters a1 =
18.087 A
˚ , b1 = 20.443 A
˚ , c1 = 7.508 A
˚ of the conventional
orthorhombic unit cell, which cohere well with the experi-
mental XRD data.29 A supercell was used to model the high-
silica mordenite zeolite. This supercell, which was constructed
by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis, contains
48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens.
Gas-phase N2, N2O, C2H6, C2H4 and H2 molecules were
represented within the same periodic code and level of theory
as the zeolite structures by surrounding molecular species with
vacuum in a 20  20  20 A
˚ 3 supercell.
Gallium-exchanged mordenite models include two (models
I, II and III) or four (models I + II and I + III) aluminium
substitutions
for
framework
silicon
ions.
The
resulting
mordenite models diﬀer in the topological distribution of
framework Al (Fig. 1(b–e)). In model I, both Al ions are
located in one 8-membered ring connecting the main channel
with the side-pocket of mordenite. In model II, aluminium
ions are located in the opposing side-pockets in the main
channel. Model III contains the Al ions in 5T and 6T rings

of the zeolite wall (Fig. 1(c)). The Al substitutions are thus
located distantly from the large 8-membered rings.
The lower-silica (Si/Al = 11) mordenite models I + II and
I + III (Fig. 1(d)) contain four aluminium substitutions
with the topologies that resemble those in models I  III.
Both models contain two Al ions in one 8-membered ring
resembling the Al distribution in model I. Two further
aluminium substitutions are introduced in the two distant
8-membered rings in the case of I + II model, whereas
I + III model was constructed by placing Al ions at the
framework positions in 5T and 6T rings, similar to the Al
localization in models II and III, respectively (Fig. 1(e)).
The relative stabilities of diﬀerent gallium-oxide cationic
species in mordenite models were evaluated based on the
computed energy change (DE) of the reaction mimicking the
experimental stoichiometric oxidation of the Ga+-containing
zeolite with N2O:
[nGa+] MOR + nN2O-[(GaO)n
n+] MOR + nN2
where MOR is the respective mordenite model, n = 2, for
models I, II and III and n = 4 for models I + II and I + III.
The corresponding reaction energy changes were calculated as
DE = E([(GaO)n
n+]MOR) + nE(N2)
 E([nGa+]MOR) + nE(N2O)
where E([(GaO)n
n+]MOR) is the calculated total electronic
energy of the mordenite model MOR containing the oxygenated
cationic cluster, E([nGa+]MOR) is the total energy of the
respective model with Ga+ charge-compensating ions, and
E(N2) and E(N2O) are the total electronic energies of N2 and
N2O molecules.

Results and discussion
3.1
Structure and stability
Fig. 2 shows the optimized structures and summarizes the
relative stabilities of various (GaO)2
2+ isomers in mordenite
models I, II and III (Si/Al = 23). The energy of the initial
systems with two Ga+ cations located at the intersection of the
main channel and the side-pockets of mordenite (models I and II)
does not depend on the position of the framework anionic
sites. The diﬀerence in the computed total energy of zeolites I
and II with two Ga+ ions does not exceed 0.01 kJ mol1.
Structure [(Ga+)2]III is however less stable by 9 kJ mol1. This
is most likely due to lower ﬂexibility of the [AlO2] framework
units in small 5T and 6T rings of the main zeolite channel (III)
as compared to the tetrahedra at the intersection of the
mordenite channels. This results in slightly longer Ga–Oz
(z = zeolite) bonds and consequently in a weaker interaction
between the exchangeable cation and the framework oxygen
ions (see ESIw). Nevertheless, these diﬀerences are within the
accuracy of the computational method. This result is in
agreement with previous propositions on the slight depen-
dence of the properties of univalent gallium ions on the
framework aluminium distribution in zeolite.14
Stoichiometric oxidation of Ga+ by nitrous oxide to GaO+
is slightly exothermic ([(GaO+)2], Fig. 2). Formation of two
isolated gallyl ions in a single side-pocket of model I requires
an unfavorable coordination of one of the GaO+ (Ga2–O2 in
[(GaO+)2]I, Fig. 2) cations to the zeolite wall. Geometry
optimization of a similar starting structure but with both
GaO+ species initially coordinated to the oxygen anions of
one 8-membered ring of model I leads to [(GaOGaO)2+]I,
which is more stable by 118 kJ mol1 than [(GaO+)2]I.

Because of an almost in-plane location of the GaO+ in the
8-memebered rings of zeolite II, the terminal extraframework
oxygen atoms (O1 and O2) are only 3.1 A
˚ separated from the
lattice oxygens of the ring resulting in their repulsion. This
explains the lower stability of [(GaO+)2]II as compared to the
respective structure in model III. Similar to the case of model I,
rearrangement of the isolated gallyl ions results in an
oxygen-bridged dimer (GaOGaO)2+ in II and III with an
energy beneﬁt of 114 and 30 kJ mol1, respectively (Fig. 2).
One notes that although the distance between the framework
Al ions in III (B7.5 A
˚ ) is the shortest among the various
mordenite models (Table 1), the shape of the channel and the
location of framework [AlO2] units do not allow such dimer
to coordinate to both anionic sites. This results in the forma-
tion of a charge-alternating structure ([(GaOGaO)2+]III), in
which one of the positively charged gallium ions (Ga2)
coordinates to the lattice oxygen ions from the neutral [SiO2]
framework unit (Fig. 2, Table 1). The lack of direct charge
compensation of one of the Ga centers results in a lower
exothermicity of formation of [(GaOGaO)2+]III.
Further stabilization of the extraframework species is achieved
by formation of an almost square-planar (Ga2O2)+2 cation. This
further lowers the total energies by 319, 177, and 37 kJ mol1 for
models I, II, and III, respectively (Fig. 2). The much higher
energy gain upon formation of the cyclic dimer cation in model I
is due to an almost perfect tetrahedral surrounding of both Ga
ions in the side-pocket of mordenite ([(Ga2O2)2+]I, Table 1). The
lower exothermicity of the formation of the cyclic binuclear
cations in zeolites II and III is due to the location of Ga2O2
2+
along the zeolite channel ([(Ga2O2)2+]II-W and [(Ga2O2)2+]III-W)
that does not allow the favorable tetrahedral coordination
environment of the Ga ions. In addition, the absence of direct
interaction of the cation with anionic framework sites in
[(Ga2O2)2+]III-W further decreases its stability. These diﬀerences
already indicate the importance of optimal geometrical environ-
ment of the extraframework cationic complex.

A more favorable location of the Ga2O2
2+ ion in models II
and III is obtained by allowing the complex to adopt an
almost perfect tetrahedral surrounding of the Ga ions in the
side pocket ([(Ga2O2)2+]II-SP and [(Ga2O2)2+]III-SP). The total
energies of these structures are lower by 30 and 49 kJ mol1,
respectively, in spite of further separation of the charges. In
[(Ga2O2)2+]II-SP one of the Ga3+ ions coordinates to a neutral
silicon-occupied oxygen tetrahedron and is located 5.441 A
˚
from the negative framework charge in the main channel
(Table 1). Structure [(Ga2O2)2+]III-SP can be considered as
an extreme case of charge-alternation. The Ga2O2
2+ ion
coordinates two neutral [SiO2] framework units, while the
anionic sites are at distances of 5.313 and 8.360 A
˚ . The
preference
for
such
an
unconventional
type
of
charge
compensation of the cationic complex is due to the dominance
of the energy gain due to favorable tetrahedral geometry
around the Ga3+ ions over the energy loss resulting from
the lack of a counterion in the ﬁrst coordination sphere of the
metal center. It is important to realize that the framework
oxygen anions which bridge between lattice silicons are
suﬃciently basic to stabilize positively charged species.
When direct charge compensation and a favorable geometry
of the extraframework cations can be realized simultaneously,
the most stable structure [(Ga2O2)2+]I is preferred. However,
the aluminium distribution in zeolites is generally random.32
Thus, the occurrence of a large fraction of anionic sites in a
speciﬁc paired arrangement ideal for the stabilization of cyclic
Ga2O2
2+ ion is not likely. In the alternative case, the position
of the cationic complex is not dominated by localized charge
compensation
between
the
cations
and
the
framework
anionic sites.
Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been
proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica
zeolites,13,16–21 the present results indicate that such species
should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of
the Al distribution. The driving force is the formation of
multinuclear oxygenated gallium species with a more optimal
coordination of the metal centers. Identiﬁcation of oxygen-
bridged Ga3+ dimers is not surprising considering the large
number of organometallic complexes with binuclear gallium
cores. The Cambridge Structural Database33 holds 139
compounds containing a cyclic Ga2O2 moiety, whereas no
crystal
structure
containing
a
terminating
gallyl
group
was found. Most of these multinuclear compounds contain
bis-(m2-OR)-di-Ga moieties (R = H, alkyl), which can be
synthesized by a variety of synthetic routes. The most widely
used
method
involves
hydrolysis
of
gallium
trialkyls.34
Formation of the unsubstituted Ga2O2 core stabilized by
bulky chelating ligands has also been reported.31,35 Interestingly,
the formation of compound 2 from a monomeric Ga
precursor 1 proceeds via oxidation with two equivalents of
N2O (reaction (1)).31 This chemistry is very similar to that
explored for Ga+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolite.13
In the present case, the zeolite framework can be regarded
as a relatively rigid polydentate ligand coordinating the
exchangeable cations and conditioning their chemical properties.
Compound 2 is the analogue of a Ga2O2
2+ cation stabilized in
zeolite. The structural parameters of the Ga2O2 core in 2 and
in the zeolite structures are very similar (Table 1). A diﬀerence
is found in the less symmetric structures [(Ga2O2)2+]II-W
and
[(Ga2O2)2+]III-W
with
slightly
longer
interatomic
distances which should be due to the rigidity of the zeolite
framework.

In contrast to the ligand in complex 1, the zeolite does not
provide rather bulky protective groups around the binuclear
gallium centers which prevent further oligomerization of
the oxygenated species. Thus, one should also consider the
formation of cationic (GaO)n
n+ complexes with n 4 2 in the
zeolite case. Numerous compounds containing gallium-oxo
and gallium-hydroxo polyhedra or ring structures with a
rather high degree of aggregation have been reported.36,37
Structural characterization of (GaO)n cage complexes is
limited to the silyl substituted species [(tBu)3SiGaO]4 ( 3),
which has an almost perfect cubic Ga4O4 core and an average
Ga–O distance near 1.91 A
˚ (Fig. 3, Table 2).37 To check the
possibility of formation of similar clusters in mordenite, the
stability of Ga4O4
4+ cation in models I + II and I + III was
theoretically investigated. The gallium–oxo cluster was placed
at the side-pocket of mordenite containing two framework Al
ions, which is reminiscent to the cation site in model I, while

the other two Al ions required for charge neutrality were
placed distantly from the cation site to achieve a rather
homogeneous aluminium distribution in the mordenite lattice.

Fig. 3 shows the structures and the energies of formation of the
cubic Ga4O4
4+ cation according to reaction (2). Table 2 lists
interatomic distances for the Ga4O4 core in the organometallic
complex 3 and in the zeolite matrices. Unlike the silyl
substituted complex 3, the zeolite matrix cannot provide
equally favorable coordination to all the Ga3+ ions of the
Ga4O4 cationic cluster. Independent of the zeolite model, three
gallium ions of the cluster are surrounded by ﬁve oxygen ions,
two of which belong to the zeolite framework. The remaining
Ga3+ is coordinatively unsaturated and binds to three extra-
framework O atoms. This asymmetry results in a signiﬁcant
deviation of Ga–O bond lengths compared to that observed in
complex 3 (Table 2). In spite of similar geometries of the
gallium–oxo clusters [(Ga4O4)4+]I+II and [(Ga4O4)4+]I+III,
the latter structure shows a 50 kJ mol1 lower stability due
to the more distant location of the charge compensating
framework [AlO2] units. The most stable structures in the
higher-silica models are those involving a cyclic Ga2O2 dimer
stabilized in the side-pocket of mordenite. Assuming that the
increasing concentration of framework aluminium does not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the stability of binuclear cationic species,
the DE values for reaction (3) are estimated to 822 and
630 kJ mol1, respectively, for models I + II and I + III.
These values are close to those calculated for the formation of
(Ga4O4)4+ species. Formation of two binuclear cations in
I + II is only 30 kJ mol1 per Ga ion more favorable than
the formation of a cubic cation. For model I + III reaction (2)
is slightly more favorable (6 kJ mol1 per Ga ion).
Summarizing, binuclear Ga2O2 cationic complexes should
be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing mordenites.
Independent of the Al distribution in the mordenite frame-
work, oligomerization of GaO+ species is strongly favored
and leads to binuclear Ga2O2
2+ complexes. Formation of
oligomers with a higher degree of aggregation is expected
when the framework Al density is increased. Although the
computational results presented so far have been obtained for
a single zeolite topology, the results are also relevant for other
high-silica zeolites with diﬀerent topologies such as ZSM-5.
Although the pore dimensions and shapes and geometries of
the cation sites may be diﬀerent from those in mordenite, the
rather large binuclear Ga2O2
2+ complex has the possibility to
coordinate to the zeolite wall in such way that an optimal
tetrahedral or close to tetrahedral coordination of the gallium
ions is obtained. We argue that formation of this favorable
coordination
via
interaction
with
basic
oxygen
anions
dominates over direct charge compensation and leads to
clustering of the extraframework species. As such, the zeolite
wall should be considered as a ligand consisting of a large
number of basic oxygen anions instead of a ligand with speciﬁc
coordination sites. In principle, this view is also relevant to

argued that it is relevant to the Fe/ZSM-5 system38 as the
driving force to form multinuclear iron oxide complexes
should be high and dominate over direct charge compensation
to form FeO+ ions.

Reactivity of binuclear sites
In catalysis, the most stable sites often show signiﬁcantly lower
chemical reactivity than their less stable counterparts. To
verify whether this could be the case for the Ga2O2
2+ ion,
the energetics of the most important reaction steps of catalytic
ethane dehydrogenation were compared for the most stable
structure [(Ga2O2)2+]I and GaO+ ions, which were found to
be much less stable.
The following elementary reaction steps are relevant to the
dehydrogenation of alkanes (RH) over Lewis acid–base pair
Ga3+–O2 in extraframework oxygenated gallium cationic
complexes species such as in GaO+ and Ga2O2

Previously, the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation over
isolated mononuclear gallyl sites in ZSM-5 zeolite has been
studied in ref. 22. It has been shown that initial heterolytic
C–H bond cleavage (reaction (4)) over GaO+ is highly
exothermic and shows a very low activation energy. Subsequent
ethylene desorption (5) depends only slightly on the nature of
the local surroundings of the Ga3+ ion. The terminal OH
group in the resulting Ga(H)(OH)+ cation shows pronounced
basic properties. As a result, water formation (7) is strongly
energetically favored over H2 desorption (6).20,22 The energetics
of these steps for GaO+ site stabilized in the periodic
mordenite model II are summarized in Table 3. The data
cohere well with those previously computed for a ZSM-5
zeolite model.22 This supports the conclusion of limited inﬂu-
ence of the local surrounding on the chemical properties of
isolated Ga-sites in high-silica zeolites.
Initial C–H bond cleavage of C2H6 over the dimeric
Ga2O2
2+ site is exothermic (DE = 62 kJ mol1) and shows
a moderate activation barrier (DEa = 118 kJ mol1, Table 3).
The Ga2O2 ring opens upon ethane dissociation leading to the
formation of Ga–C2H5 and Ga–OH species, each bound to
[AlO2] framework units and connected via a bridging oxygen
ion ([C2H5–GaOGa–OH]2+). The decomposition of the ring
structure allows conservation of the favorable tetrahedral
environment of Ga3+ ions. In the next step, the grafted
C2H5
 group decomposes via b-H abstraction, resulting in
formation of ethylene and a hydride ion ([H–GaOGa–OH]2+)
bound to Ga (reaction (5)). This reaction is endothermic
(DE = 140 kJ mol1).
H2 recombination (6) from [H–GaOGa–OH]2+ ion closes
the catalytic cycle via regeneration of the active cyclic Ga2O2

This
reaction
shows
an
activation
barrier
of
168 kJ mol1. This is twice lower than the value of 326 kJ mol1
computed for the less stable isolated GaO+ site (Table 3).
Unfortunately, the transition state structure for the competing
H2O desorption pathway has not been identiﬁed. However,
taking into account that the enthalpy of water desorption in
this case exceeds the activation barrier for H2 recombination,
one may tentatively conclude that the latter process is
signiﬁcantly favored for the binuclear Ga2O2 site. The
explanation for the strong diﬀerences lies in the high basicity
of the terminal extraframework oxygen atoms in isolated
GaO+ ions. The consequence is a high reactivity towards
proton abstraction during initial heterolytic C–H cleavage in
hydrocarbons. On the contrary, it does not allow regeneration
of the active site due to the high stability of the grafted
reaction intermediates. Coordination of a terminal oxygen
atom to a further Lewis acid Ga ion and the formation of
an oxygen-bridged species decreases its basicity signiﬁcantly.
This facilitates hydrogen recombination during the catalytic
dehydrogenation reaction, thus providing a path for the
regeneration of the active site.
Intermediate
[H–GaOGa–OH]2+
can
rearrange
to
a
[H–Ga(OH)(O)Ga]2+ cyclic cation (Fig. 4). This process
competes with H2 recombination (DE = 61 and 92 kJ mol1,
respectively, for rearrangement and H2 recombination). The
resulting cationic complex can also be considered for the
dissociative adsorption of ethane. The catalytic cycle consists
of similar elementary steps as discussed above. The interplay
of the sterics of the zeolitic cation site and the hydrogen bond
formation between the extraframework complex and the
zeolite walls results in a signiﬁcant coordinative unsaturation
of one of the Ga3+ cations (Ga2, Fig. 4). This leads to a
signiﬁcant decrease of the activation barrier for dissociative
ethane adsorption, and at the same time enhances the stability
of the product [H–Ga(OH)2Ga–C2H5]2+ of initial C–H
cleavage (Table 3). The activation energies for C–H cleavage
by GaO+ and [H–Ga(OH)(O)Ga]2+ are similar, whereas the
stability of the products is lower for the binuclear complex.
Formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic
cycle facilitates the regeneration of the active site. Indeed,
moderate barriers are calculated for H2 recombination in the
catalytic cycle involving [H–Ga(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species. Water
desorption is also favored in this case over the regeneration of
the active site. However, the diﬀerence in the calculated
energetics for these competing processes over binuclear
site is signiﬁcantly reduced as compared to the case of
mononuclear GaO+ ions.
These computational results clearly show that formation of
binuclear oxygenated Ga3+ species in high-silica zeolites
provide a favorable path for the regeneration of the active
site. This path is absent for isolated gallyl ions. It is expected
that the decrease of basicity of the bridging extraframework
oxygen atoms results in preference of the one-step desorption
mechanism of H2 and C2H4 over the consecutive alternative,
similar to the conclusions reached for ethane dehydrogenation
by zinc-exchanged zeolites.39 Such mechanism would increase
the lifetime of the oxygenated Ga3+ species. Nevertheless, the
hydrogenated binuclear sites tend to decompose upon the
catalytic process via H2O desorption, resulting in the forma-
tion of less reactive reduced Ga species. This conclusion agrees
with the experimental observations.13 One expects that the
degenerative reduction path can be suppressed by addition of
water to the reaction mixture. The results of the experimental
catalytic activity measurementsy of propane conversion as a
function of the steam partial pressure over initially Ga+ ions
stabilized by ZSM-5 zeolite are summarized in Table 4.
Clearly, co-feeding of water leads to a substantial increase of
the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at
pH2O of 0.3 kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam
(0.3 kPa) is stable over a period of at least 4 h. The very
diﬀerent product composition between Ga+/ZSM-5 in the
absence of steam and the parental HZSM-5 points to a change
in the mechanism from protolytic hydrocarbon activation
involving C–H and C–C bond cleavage for HZSM-5 to
dominant C–H activation over the Lewis acidic Ga sites.13
Addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases
signiﬁcantly the dehydrogenation activity. The main product
remains propylene although with increasing water content,

ethylene) is observed. This suggests formation of Brønsted
acid protons due to hydrolysis of extraframework species.40
More ethylene than methane is formed due to additional
proton-catalyzed oligomerization/cracking reactions of propene.
The carbon selectivity to dehydrogenated products remains
however well over 85%. The increased dehydrogenation
activity of Ga/ZSM-5 over HZSM-5 is obvious from the
increased amount of hydrogen formed. No oxidation products
such as carbon oxides are detected in the reactor eﬄuent. The
complete hydrolysis of the active intrazeolitic Ga sites at
higher pH2O results in activity decrease. 27Al NMR measure-
ments indicate that prolonged steam exposure does not lead to
massive redistribution of tetrahedral aluminium species. The
promoting eﬀect of water is due to the formation of reactive
partly hydrolyzed gallium species such as [H–GaOGa–OH]2+
and [H–Ga(OH)2Ga–H]2+ discussed above.
To provide additional justiﬁcation of the above theoretical
results, a temperature-programmed desorption experiment
was carried out over Ga+/ZSM-5 in an atmosphere of
0.3 vol.% H2O in He.y The theoretical insights imply that
H2 desorption should be rather facile from the hydroxylated
Ga clusters in high-silica zeolites. Indeed, hydrogen evolution
is observed around 600 K. In a similar experiment for the
gallium-free HZSM-5 zeolite, no hydrogen is formed. The
desorption
energy
estimated
from
the
H2
desorption
maximum gives a value of 140  12 kJ mol1. This result
agrees very well with the computed value for H2 recombina-
tion from the fully hydroxylated cluster [H–Ga(OH)2Ga–H]2+
(DE = 142 kJ mol1), whereas the corresponding reac-
tion energy for the isolated gallyl ions is considerably higher
(DE = 288 kJ mol1, Table 3).

Conclusions
The
stability
of
isomeric
binuclear
Ga3+
oxygenated
(Ga2O2
2+) extraframework species in various high-silica
mordenite models is investigated using periodic DFT calcula-
tions. The isolated gallyl ions are unstable in such a zeolite and
tend to oligomerize, resulting in oxygen-bridged Ga3+ pairs.
Independent of the framework aluminium distribution in the
zeolite, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable cations. The
location and stability of such cationic clusters are mainly
controlled by the favorable geometric environment of the
Ga3+ ions, while the eﬀect of the direct interaction with the
framework anionic sites is less important. This typically leads
to
charge-alternating
structures
when
the
conventional
charge compensation does not provide favorable tetrahedral
coordination of Ga ions. For more aluminium-rich zeolite
models, it is predicted that cubic Ga4O4
4+ cations are also
stable. Such species interact directly with two [AlO2] frame-
work units, while the remaining two anionic sites are located
remotely.
Binuclear gallium–oxo cationic species show signiﬁcant
reactivity toward heterolytic C–H cleavage. Catalytic dehydro-
genation of ethane over the Ga2O2 proceeds via initial
heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid–base pair formed
by the Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom
followed by oleﬁn desorption and hydrogen recombination.
The last two steps may take place in a concerted manner. The
decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the
stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species
facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the
cluster in principle opens a pathway to its decomposition via
water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites. Such
insight predicts that addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed
increases the steady-state concentration of the binuclear
gallium–oxo and –hydroxo species. Catalytic experiments
support well this proposal: a substantial increase in the
dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite is observed
upon water co-feeding. Continuous addition of water is required
to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the reactive
oxygenated extraframework species.
