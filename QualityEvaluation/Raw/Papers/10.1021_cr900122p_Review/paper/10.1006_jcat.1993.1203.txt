Transient Isotopic Labeling Studies under Steady-State Conditions in Partial Oxidation of Methane to Formaldehyde over MoO3 Catalysts
Abstract
The oxygen insertion pathway over MoO3 catalysts has been investigated for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using transient isotopic labeling under steady-state reaction conditions. Catalyst samples preferentially exposing basal (010) and side (100) planes have been characterized using various techniques including scanning electron microscopy with three-dimensional imaging, BET surface area, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and laser Raman spectroscopy. In addition to isotopic labeling studies, these catalysts have also been examined under steady-state reaction conditions to assess the effect of the concentration of gas-phase oxygen. Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the MoO sites, These sites are then preferentially replenished through bulk diffusion of oxygen. The bridging MoOMo sites, on the other hand, appear to be involved in complete oxidation and are more easily regenerated by gas-phase oxygen.
