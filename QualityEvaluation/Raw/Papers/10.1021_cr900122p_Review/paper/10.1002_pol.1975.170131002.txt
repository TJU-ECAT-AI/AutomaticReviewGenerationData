INTRODUCTION 
Transition metal alkyl compounds have been known since 1952 but it is 
only recently that relationships between structures and catalytic activity 
have been worked 0ut.l The main conclusion derived from the study of ho- 
mogeneous polymerizations is that isoleptic transition metal alkyls of Ti(IV), 
Zr(IV), Hf(IV), Cr(III), Cr(IV), where the organo ligand can be r-allyl, - 
CH2Ar (where Ar is an aromatic residue), CH&i(CH&, neopentyl, etc., are 
weakly active catalysts. Most other hydrocarbyl ligands such as Cpd, pyri- 
dine, aryl, CO, etc., deactivate the center. A summary of the homogeneous 
catalysts studied is given in Table I. 
A further feature of the homogeneous transition metal alkyl catalysts was 
the study of the polymerization of styrene by Zr(benzyl)4 in toluene.2 The 
advantages of this system is that the transition metal retains its oxidation 
state during the polymerization. This has given valuable information on the 
growth and termination processes. The latter is a useful model in under- 
standing the behavior of the more complex but highly active heterogeneous 
catalysts which are the subject of this paper. 
COLLOIDAL POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS 
The most important class of transition metal alkyl catalysts so far discov- 
ered are those obtained by reacting the latter with the -OH 
groups on the 
surface of colloidal alumina or ~ilica.~ 
These catalysts which for reasons 
which will become evident later, are properly described as “colloidal cata- 
lysts” are a distinct class, are of long life, and possess exceptional activity as 
is shown in Table I. 
The surface of silica and alumina freed from physically adsorbed water 
contain acidic OH groups which will react with transition metal alkyls. 
These reactions can be followed in the infrared.’ It has been found that

transition metal alkyl compounds can react with the OH groups in more than 
one way, and the product obtained depends on several factors. For example, 
Zr(a1lyl)r reacts with silica predried at 200°C to give two molecules of pro- 
pene per metal atom, utilizing in the course of this process two OH groups per 
metal atom. The chemistry of the process is accurately described by eq. (1):

We have observed similar keactions with Zr(C&C&)4, 
Zr[CH2Si(CH3)3]4, 
and Zr[CHZOCH&; and also silica can be replaced by alumina and other ma- 
trices, giving transition metal centers with structures related to I in which the 
organic ligands are CH2C6H5, CH2Si(CH3)3, 
etc. 
If some of the hydrocarbyl ligands in Ti, Zr, or Hf alkyls are replaced by 
halogen atoms, transition metal centers of type I1 and I11 are obtained.

Figure 1 
shows typical changes in polymerization rate R with time obtained 
for the polymerization of ethylene with Zr(.benzyl)4/A1203 
catalysts. These 
steady rates can be maintained over long periods provided mass transfer 
problems do not interfere. The dependence of rate on monomer concentra- 
tion is given in Figure 2 and is seen to be, over the range of concentrations 
studied, accurately first-order. A similar result is obtained for the polymer- 
ization of styrene with a fourfold change in the concentration of monomer 
and is shown in Table 1
1
.
 We may conclude, therefore, that the change in 
rate with monomer concentration is described reasonably by the equation 
Measurements of the total concentration of polymer chains Z
;
 [Dn] 
have 
been carried out in the case of the styrene and ethylene systems, and the re- 
sults are summarized in Tables I1 and 1

.
 A notable feature is that this 
quantity is small and that only one atom of Zr in about lo2 
is used at any one 
time in polymer growth, which is comparable in order of magnitude (102-103) 
with the homogeneous model. The closeness of the styrene and ethylene 
values for XT[Dn], particularly since the latter polymerizes 10,000 times as 
fast, suggests that the measurements are independent of rates and type of 
monomer. Values of 2T[D,] in Table I11 show that the number of propagat- 
ing centers remains more or less constant with conversion, suggesting that all 
chains attached to metal atoms are actively growing. This was not the case 
with the homogeneous systems studied.2

abstraction. Molecular weights are independent of conversion, as shown by 
the data for polystyrenes made with these catalysts and summarized in Table

 It is also evident from Table I11 that the molecular weight is markedly 
dependent on the monomer concentration. This was also observed in the ho- 
mogeneous polymerization of styrene by Zr(benzyl)4.

marized in Table IV. It will be seen that the amount of polymer derived 
from the initial insertion reaction remains stationary, but the proportion of 
the total declines as the amount of polymer originating from the re-alkylated 
[Zr-HI 
centers [eq. (
8
)
]
 
becomes more important. The latter centers are re- 
sponsible for the conversion of the majority of monomer to polymer in the 
ethylene system, and the initiation stage is even less important. 
It is not possible to measure the very high molecular weights of polyethyl- 
ene prepared with these catalysts in the absence of hydrogen. In the pres- 
ence of the latter the value of Mn 
obtained are sensitive to both the concen- 
tration of ethylene and hydrogen. The data obtained are summarized in 
Table V and plotted in Figure 3 in the manner suggested by eq. (16). This 
gives a very good straight line over a wide range of hydrogen and ethylene 
concentrations. 
In order to comprehend the chemistry of the process further it is necessary 
to trace the behavior of catalyst particles during the polymerization. This is 
readily deducible from the microscopic studies of the polymer produced. In 
Figure 4 
it is seen that polyethylene is laid down in cylinders of fairly uniform 
diameter which wind into helices. In the example quoted the original alumi- 
na catalyst has completely disintegrated, giving a polymer particle with an in- 
crease in diameter of five times. Further analysis with the million volt elec- 
tron microscope at Harwell shows that these alumina particle fragments are 
located at the tips of the cylinder as shown in Figure 5. We can therefore 
visualise the polymerization process as follows. 
The initial alumina particle with attached Zr-alkyl groups break up in the 
early stages of polymerization into particles of 1000 A or less which form nu- 
clei around which chain growth and crystallization occur. The polymer 
chains generated fold to give lamellae (polyethylene single crystals) which 
TRANSITION METAL ALKYL CATALYSTS 
2197 
stack behind the alumina particle with the long axis of polymer chains paral- 
lel to the axis of the cylindrical envelope shown in Figure 4. Direct evidence 
that the orientation of polyethylene chains is along the long axis of the cylin- 
der in Figure 4 was obtained by looking at the electron diffraction pattern of 
a cylinder in corresponding orientation. Well-defined maxima on the (1 
10) 
and (200) arcs were perpendicular to the cylinder axis; hence the preferred 
chain direction is seen to be parallel to this axis. Following an initial degra- 
dation of the primary catalyst particle, the catalyst fragments are pushed 
outwards from the center at the tips of cylinders which coil to give helices 
shown in Figure 4
.
 It is evident from this description that the diffusion bar- 
rier between catalyst sites and monomer is independent of the amount of 
polymer formed which accounts for the persistence of high rates of polymer- 
ization at high conversion (Fig. l), 
a characteristic of this system. 
The physical constraints leading to the overall morphology, however, are 
not understood. In particular why is such a uniform cylindrical envelope 
maintained during the growth? One possible explanation is that the polymer 
at the tip is molten and surface tension effects maintain the shape. 
The preceding results suggest that the polymerization process proceeds in 
accordance with the following mechanism. The catalyst center (V) coordi- 
nates monomer, giving (VI) which is present in low concentrations.

Insertion of the monomer between the benzyl group and metal atom gives

Re-alkylation of X reactivates the propagating center, and repetition of reac-

An important difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous 
transition metal alkyl compounds is that the hydride species X is an active 
center and re-alkylates readily, whereas species such as [CsH&H2]3ZrH are 
inactive in solution as a result of dimerization.* 
In the polymerization of ethylene hydrogen can be used as a transfer agent 
giving the hydride X and a saturated polymer molecule:

In analyzing the kinetics of the process it is worth noting that the initiation

consume

In the homogeneous systems z;D[Dn] 
can be computed from the concentra- 
tions of Zr(benzy1)d and styrene but this is not possible in this case since we 
cannot calculate the number of propagating Zr atoms located on the terminal 
position of the stacks of lamellae shown in Figure 5. It is therefore necessary 
to use the tritium oxide quenching procedure to measure ZT[Dn] directly. 
The product K2k2, determined from the ratio R/[M]Z;D[D,], will tend to be 
too small by an amount related to difference in concentration of monomer 
around the growing polymer tip and that close to the catalyst site within the 
tip. The values of K2k2 quoted in Tables I1 and I11 must therefore be re- 
garded as minimum values. 
The number-average degree of polymerization p, is given by the relation- 
ship (16): 
2200 
BALLARD 
In the absence of hydrogen, P n  = (Kzkz/k4)[M]o;. 
i.e., there should be a 
marked dependence of molecular weight on monomer concentration. The 
limited amount of information in Table I11 supports this statement. It has 
also been found that hydrogen modified the molecular weight during the po- 
lymerization of ethylene. 
Equation (16) predicts that a plot of [M]o/Pn against [Hz] 
will be a straight 
line with slope kdkzK2 and intercept k4Ik2Kz. A typical plot using the data 
in Table V is shown in Figure 3. The intercept is very small and hardly de- 
tectable on the scale, confirming that k3 <
<
 124, which is consistent with the 
observation that in the absence of hydrogen very high molecular polymers are 
obtained. Allowing for this fact the agreement between eq. (16) and Figure 3 
is very good, and we derive from it k4 = 1.25 X 10-2k2K2 and k3 < 1.5 X 
Some interesting perspectives of the polymerization of olefins by transition 
metal alkyls can be derived from a consideration of the organic chemistry of 
metal alkyls in general.

EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN METAL ALKYLS AND OLEFINS 
In this discussion of compound formation between metals and olefins we 
will highlight the similarities between such transition metals as Ti, Zr, Hf (no 
d-electrons) and the alkyl compounds of lithium, boron, and aluminum. 
Hitherto, olefin-metal complexes were considered to be formed exclusively 
by transition metals with d-electrons, platinum and palladium being classic 
examples of a-bonding. If d-electrons were shown to be essential for the 
bonding of the olefins and accounts for the stability of compounds of this 
type.4 However, this does not exclude other possible methods of association. 
One possibility is that the olefin behaves simply as a weak base with a lone 
pair of electrons. Metal alkyl compounds which are electron-deficient could 
then associate with olefins in the same way that they do with pyridine and 
ethers. 
In considering a mechanism of hydrogenation, isomerization, oligomeriza- 
tion and polymerization, the nature of the transition state is of critical impor- 
tance. It is important to enquire if these reactions all involve a step in which 
the olefin and metal form a coordination complex. We will first consider 
nontransition metals where evidence for these compounds has recently be- 
come available. 
Aluminum alkyls are electron-deficient and consequently prefer to exist as 
dimers; also, they react with a large number of donor molecules, for example, 
amines, ethers, phosphines, etc., to give molecules analogous to XII. Some of 
TRANSITION METAL ALKYL CATALYSTS

these compounds are very stable. Of particular interest for this discussion is 
a family of intramolecule complexes XIII,5

where Y is N(C2H5)2, SiC2H5, SC2H5, etc., and R may be C2H5 or C4H9. In- 
cluded among this group is the intramolecule olefins complex XIV,G which 
has been identified unequivocally by using infrared and NMR spectroscopy. 
In a more comprehensive study, Oliver and co-workers7

confirmed the presence of interaction of the type (XIV) and showed that the 
metal-carbon bridge bond is at the lower energy range for bonds of this type. 
Moreover, compounds such as (XIV) are monomeric whereas conventional 
aluminum alkyls are dimeric. In describing reactions of aluminum alkyls or 
alkyl hydrides with olefins we can therefore write with confidence structures 
of the type XV and XVI.

Similar techniques have been used to identify bonding between other met-

presence of compounds such as di-4-pent~lzinc.~ 
Compounds similar to this and hexenyl metal derivatives of lithium, boron, 
e t ~ . ~  
are described. On the other hand, no interaction exists in alkenyltid or 
alkenylmercury  compound^.^ 
We will now consider transition metals without d-electrons. Indirect evi- 
dence has been obtained for the existence of species of the type XVII from 
studies of the interaction of Zr(benzyl)4 
with Lewis bases.

It has been shown that Zr(benzy1)l 
reacts reversably with compounds such as 
pyridine, quinoline, and tri-n-butyl phosphine oxide, giving compounds such 
as Zr(benzyl)4L and Zr(benzy1)dLz. They are readily detected by observation 
of the methylene protons of the benzyl groups or the relevant ligand protons 
in the 220-MHz spectrometer.10 For example, pyridine reacts as shown in 
eq. (18).

The spectroscopic studies show the co-ordination complex is in equilibrium 
with free Zr(benzy1)l and pyridine but this equilibrium is predominantly to 
the right-hand side of eq. (18). In fact, both pyridine complexes have been 
isolated. In view of these results it is natural to assume that, since ethylene 
may also be considered as Lewis base, species of type XVII will also be 
formed. However, it was found by using similar spectroscopic measurements 
to the above that such a complex could not be detected. From this it was 
concluded that if the complex was formed, its concentration was small, prob- 
ably less than 1% 
of the Zr(benzyl)4 
present. 
Values for the equilibrium constant for complex formation with a silanom- 
ethyl compound have recently been measuredll by modification of the well 
known gas-liquid chromatography method previously used to measure the 
equilibrium constant for complexes of olefins with AgN03,12 Rh(CO)z(a- 
cac),13 
and IrI(CO)(PPh3)2.14 The results are summarized in Table VI. The 
values for the equilibrium constant confirm that the concentration of com- 
plex XVII is indeed very small. In the polymerization less than 0.1% of the 
catalyst present will be in the form XVII. A value of K = 12.6 f 
0.6 l./mole 
for the pyridine/Zr(benzyl)r 1:1 adduct15 has been obtained at 78OC; hence 
the values in Table VI are reasonably consistent with the relative basicities of 
pyridine and ethylene.

An interesting result in Table VI is that butadiene coordinates less readily 
than ethylene. This agrees with previous observations12 with Ag(1) salts, 
where the equilibrium constants were in the order ethylene > propene > bu- 
tene-1 > butadiene. Intuitively one would guess that butadiene would be 
more strongly coordinated to the transition metal. 
In conclusion, therefore, the interaction of an olefin and metal alkyl com- 
pound is more properly considered an extension of Lewis acid-base chemis- 
try. This follows from the above observations. 
METAL ALKYLS AS HYDROGENATION CATALYSTS 
The P-hydrogen abstraction process (7) generates a transition metal hy- 
dride (X). Similar species to this can be produced by reaction of the catalyst 
with hydrogen. In the presence of excess hydrogen

a variety of olefins can be hydrogenated, for example, cyclopentene, propyl- 
ene, cyclohexene, etc. [eq. (19)]. Processes of this kind require insertion of 
an olefin between a metal hydrogen bond followed by hydrogenolysis analo- 
gous to process (19). It is interesting to note that just as zirconium alkyls are 
activated by the OH groups on silica and alumina for polymerization, they are 
simply activated for hydrogenation; Zr(benzyl)* in solution is only at best a 
poor hydrogenation catalyst. 
Aluminum alkyl hydrides show similar reaction, for example [eq. (20)].

Processes of this type occur in aluminum alky116J7

The most interesting example is triisobutylaluminum. At 6O-8O0C the 
equilibrium lies predominantly towards the left-hand side of eq. (20), where- 
as at 120-150°C significant amounts of hydride are present. It is difficult to 
visualize an alternative to &hydrogen abstraction and olefin insertion pro- 
cesses occurring via four-center systems (XX), and kinetic studied6 support 
this view.

Additional evidence that transition metal alkyl chemistry is similar to alu- 
minum and boron alkyl chemistry is obtained from a consideration of eq. 
(16), which states that polymer chain length in the absence of hydrogen is de- 
termined by the ratio of the rates of olefin insertion and @-hydrogen 
abstrac- 
tion as shown by eq. (23). This 
implies that changing the ligands attached to the metal does not change the 
chemistry of the process but only the chain length. This can be demon- 
strated by considering the three metals Al(III), Zr(IV), and Ni where pn 
can 
be varied readily by changing ligands. For example where Al(CH2CH3)3 
is 
an oligomerization catalyst17 for ethylene but reacts with the OH groups of 
alumina to give (XII), 
an alumina center is obtained which

CH3Ni(CsHs)PR3 with the OH groups on silica to give the center XXII in 
this system. Pn 
is dependent on the type of phosphine attached to the metal 
center and can have values of 2 to lo7. All these results are summarized in 
Table VII and demonstrate conclusively that oligomerization and polymer- 
ization chemistry is independent of the metal atom. 
This discussion would not be complete without including the lithium al- 
kyls, which in many of their reactions are closely similar to the aluminum 
compounds but in others behave simply as anionic initiators in which the pro- 
pagating species is the carbanion. Lithium alkyls are oligomeric but it is in 
their monomeric form that they display catalytic properties. The addition of

GENERAL MECHANISM OF ORGANOMETALLIC CATALYSTS 
It is evident that the behavior of transition metals can be described in 
terms of four basic reactions: coordination of the alkene, insertion of the alk- 
ene, ,&hydrogen abstraction, and hydrogenolysis. These basic steps are asso- 
ciated with several metals such as B, Al, Zr, Ni, Rh, etc. and are associated 
with processes such as hydrogenation, polymerization, and isomerization of 
olefins. It is possible to put all this information into a few basic organic reac- 
t i o n ~ ~ ~  
in which the four-center transition state plays the major role in facili- 
tating these processes. 
It has been shown that alkene insertion [eq. (25)] and &hydrogen abstrac- 
tion [eq. (24)] are the two parts of an equilibrium process and it is therefore 
reasonable to assume a common type of transition state. The mechanism of 
2206 
BALLARD 
&hydrogen abstraction is rather obvious because the products obtained 
admit to no other course and so it provides an important clue to the structure 
of the transition state.

In eqs. (24) and (25), R = H, alkyl, or aryl; X = OH, OAc, H, or

Alkene insertion is described by eq. (25) and is derived by writing the reverse 
of eq. (24) to show a similar reaction pathway and transition-state species. 
Equations (24) and (25) are the two most important processes in organome- 
tallic catalysis and in most systems compete with one another. It is this com- 
petition which determines the products of the reaction. The balance de- 
pends on the nature of the ligands L, conditions of reaction, and concentra- 
tion of reactants and products. 
The mode of bonding of the alkene would appear not to be critical and the 
chemistry appears to be independent of the degree of affinity between alkene 
and metal. For example, Group VIII metals bond ethylene strongly because 
of back donation involving d 
-electrons and give well defined compounds.26 
But the early transition metals such as Ti, Zr, etc. resemble aluminum in that 
they have no d-electrons; consequently the alkene is only weakly bonded 
(Table VI), probably by overlap of s-orbitals of the metal with the ?r-orbitals 
of the alkene. It may be, however, that an important requirement for cataly- 
sis as distinct from compound formation is that the olefin is weakly bonded. 
It has been observed that in the case of Ti and Zr alkyls, addition of bases 
such as phosphines and amines destroys their ability to carry out reactions of 
the type described. It may well be, therefore, that addition of phosphines 
etc. to metals with d-electrons such as Rh, Ni, etc. changes the bonding of the 
olefin from the Chatt-Duncanson type, in which the interaction is very 
strong, to the Lewis acid type described for A
1
 or Zr in which it is much weak- 
er. The latter coordination is more conducive to catalytic reactions, since it 
allows the olefins to rotate to form the nonplanar transition state to be dis- 
cussed in detail in the next section. 
In compounds such as 
K[P~C~~(C~H~)]HZO, 
PtC14(C2H4)2, 
e t ~ . ~ ~  
and [Rh(C~H4)2C1]2,~~ 
the coordi- 
nated ethylene can only move in a torsional mode; complete rotation is not 
observed. 
ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS AND THE GEOMETRY OF THE 
TRANSITION STATE IN ORGANOMETALLIC CATALYSTS 
It has been shown that the most probably intermediate in organometallic 
catalysts is a four-atom transition state. From a consideration of the mecha- 
TRANSITION METAL ALKYL CATALYSTS 
2207 
nisms of asymmetric synthesis it will be shown that this center is almost cer- 
tainly not coplanar. 
A four-atom transition state in which all four atoms involved were coplanar 
was originally postulated by Brown29 
to account for the formation of a chiral 
center from olefins on reduction with optically active borohydrides. Para- 
doxically, it was pointed out by Streitweiser30 
that the reason why this type 
of intermediate is unacceptable mechanistically may be deduced from consid- 
eration of the mechanism of the formation of such chiral centers from olefins. 
The most successful system described by Brown was based on diisopino- 
camphenyl borane (XXIV) obtained by addition of diborane to a-pinene. 
This compound reacts with cis-2-butene to give a new chiral center (XXV). 
Oxidation of the latter followed by hydrolysis gives the secondary alcohol 
(XXVI); the optical yield was about 90%. Also of considerable interest was 
the observation that the olefin (XXVII) gave, by a similar series of reactions, 
the alcohol (XXVIII), also in high optical p ~ r i t y . ~ ~ , ~ ~

None of the processes are catalytic and they are really examples of asymmet- 
ric synthesis, not of asymmetric catalysis. From the assigned absolute con- 
figuration of a-pinene and assumed lowest energy for XXIV, Brown con- 
cludes that the addition of the boron-hydrogen bond to a double bond in- 
volves the four-center transition.

Brown's model was particularly successful in predicting the steric interac- 
tions leading to the correct configuration for the cis-olefin but, as Streit- 
weiser pointed 
the model is unsuccessful in the case of olefin XXVII. 
2208 
BALLARD 
The problem can be illustrated by reference to XXX. Steric control de- 
rives from the methyl groups on the 2,2’-position on the pinane ligands and 
their interaction or not with the group attached to the olefins. This concept 
is only just adequate to account for the asymmetric induction associated with 
the hydrogenation of cis-2-butene and predicts accurately the S-(-)-2- 
methyl-1-butanol is formed. The methyl group on C p  can distinguish be- 
tween R1 = CH3 or C Z H ~  
and models show that interaction between Cp-meth- 
yl is minimal when R1 = CH3 and R2 = CpHs; this gives 
XXX 
the S-configuration. The transition state obtained with olefin XXVII is 
shown in XXXI. It is now necessary for the pin&e ligands to distinguish be- 
tween an ethyl group and a hydrogen atom. In the models of the planar tran- 
sition state it is evident that the interaction between 
Et 
H 
XXXI 
the ethyl group and the 2-methyl group is too small to insist that the olefin 
adopt a configuration with respect to the pinane ligands opposite to XXXI. 
To overcome this difficulty, Streitwiser proposed a triangular .rr-complex. In 
such a complex the C
2
 methyl and the ethyl group of the olefin would be clos- 
er together, and the alternative configuration would be preferred. 
Transition states of the type XXX and XXXI derive from the concepts ap- 
plicable to organic chemistry that resonance stabilization of the transition 
state is possible only if the atoms are coplanar. Concepts of resonance stabi- 
lization among atoms in more than one plane derive from structural studies 
of organometallic compounds which began with the elucidation of the struc- 
ture of ferrocene (XXXII)32 
and later found applicable to all sandwich-type 
compounds, including Ni(2-Me allyl)2 (XXXIII). It is the latter which is 
worthy of detailed discussion, since it is an admirable model for the four-cen- 
ter nonplanar transition state, since the structure is known in 
In 
this compound the carbon atoms are all -2 a 
from the Ni atoms; in the ally1 
group, the C-C distances are equal, being approximately 1.44 %, in length, 
equal to the mean of the length of a double and single carbon bond. The lat- 
ter is the result of a resonance in the plane of the carbon atoms which is rep- 
resented by XXXIV

The energy of the ally1 group ean be computed by using the molecular orbital 
theory.34 
We now return to the discussion of compound XXXI and its ability to gen- 
erate chiral centers by reduction of the olefin XXVII. 
XXXV 
The equivalent resonant forms to XXXIV in the transition state will be 
XXXV, and the location of the atoms with respect to the boron atom and a- 
pinane ligands is diagrammatically represented by XXXVI. An intermedi- 
ate consequence of the geometry of this transition center is that the methy- 
lene group (3) 
of the olefin now lies in the same plane as the methyl groups on 
C2 and C2’ of (XXXVI). Whereas in XXXI this substituent lies well above 
these methyl groups. With the former structure the methyl groups on C2 and 
Ca’ permit only one position which is that known in XXXVI, and it predicts 
the correct configuration of (-1).

XXXIII 
Models constructed on the principle of the allylic transition state give 
therefore the correct prediction of configuration and show how a chiral center 
is formed. Additional information supplied by the models of XXXVI shows 
that access to the B atom from the underside is impeded by the bridging 
methyl groups on the a-pinane ligands which effectively screen this side of 
the molecule. 
It is evident that the information from Brown’s optically active borohy- 
dride combined with the concept at a nonplanar four-center transition state

gives an excellent model for the stereoselective olefins insertion reaction. It 
shows clearly that the substituents on the CZ 
and Cz’ positions play a key role 
in limiting access to the metal atom and that access to the underside of the 
molecule must also be prevented. We will explore the application of these 
principles to the design of hydrogenation catalysts in a subsequent publica- 
tion. 
It has been reported1 that soluble transition metal alkyls can produce mix- 
tures of soluble and insoluble isotactic polypropylenes at very slow rates but 
the yields of crystalline material is greatly improved using colloidal catalysts 
of type I. The geometry of the transition state, by analogy with XXXVI, is 
as shown in XXXVII. 
X X X W  
Models show that whereas the disposition around the metal in the case of 
pure Zr(benzy1)d limits access to the metal center sufficiently to account for 
some preference for isotactic placement, the colloidal catalysts should be 
more effective in this respect, since they limit access to the underside of the 
metal atom in-a way similar to that observed in the model of the borohydride 
XXIV. 
However, although the spectrosiopic analysis of these polymers 
shows them to be predominantly isotactic they can still contain only minor 
proportions of crystalline material. Limiting access to the metal atom still 
further by crowding the metal centers on the surface of these colloidal cata- 
lysts improves the stereo control markedly,35 
and Figure 6 shows that addi- 
tional crystalline material is obtained. This is, however, accompanied by 
some loss in reactivity of the centers as is evident from Figure 7. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Our studies have shown that polymerization by transition metal alkyl com- 
pounds are excellent models for the comprehension of reactions of this type. 
The chemistry identified is seen to be part of a more general field of organic 
reactions which embraces the metal alkyl chemistry of Li, B, Al, Zr, and Ni 
and processes such as hydrogenation, isomerization, and polymerization of 
olefins.
