Abstract
The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5
catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, UV diffuse
re¯ectance spectroscopy, BET, TPR and TPD of ammonia. Three different types of supported species were detected:
tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. The relative
amount of each one varies signi®cantly with the tungsten loading. At high contents, a decrease in BET areas due to the partial
blocking up of the channels of the zeolite and a lessening of the number of acid sites were observed. It was found that
supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. HCOH selectivity
seems to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst. # 1998 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
The catalytic conversion of methane to more valu-
able liquid fuels is still a challenging problem in the
®eld of catalysis [1±3]. Among the different routes
proposed during the previous years, the direct partial
oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde
or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it
could potentially substitute the conventional `three
step' industrial process. These have included high-
pressure studies without catalysts [4±7] and atmo-
spheric pressure studies with heterogeneous catalysts.
Both processes have been investigated in a wide range
of experimental conditions although, unfortunately,
progress towards obtaining a industrially viable pro-
cess has been very slow.
Several
supported
oxide
catalysts
have
been
employed for the partial oxidation at atmospheric
pressure, among which silica-supported MoO3 and
V2O5 catalysts have been reported to be the most
active and selective for oxygenate production. Earlier
studies of partial oxidation of methane over silica
supported MoO3 were performed using nitrous oxide
as oxidant [8±10], leading to yields of formaldehyde
higher than 2.5%. However, N2O is too expensive to
be used industrially for this purpose. Thus, the latter
studies have been focused on the use of molecular
oxygen as oxidant.

Pitchai and Klier [1] using molecular oxygen in
the partial oxidation of methane with silica±alumina
supported MoO3, reported formaldehyde selectivities
of 10±50% at methane conversion varying from
0.5% to 1.2%. Moreover, the formaldehyde selectivity
increased with the molar ratio methane/oxygen. Spen-
cer [11] and Spencer and Pereira [12] performed the
oxidation of methane over MoO3 and V2O5 supported
catalysts obtaining selectivities in excess of 70% at
very low conversion, although the selectivity dropped
drastically with increasing conversion. More recent
work by Banares et al. [13], reported selectivities
above 90% at methane conversion of 0.6% using a
MoO3/SiO2 catalyst.
It has been demonstrated that the nature and the
dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great
in¯uence on the catalysts behavior. Banares et al.
[13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that
methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are
dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the
surface species. Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demon-
strated that the presence of vanadium oxide species
with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the
oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of
species without terminal V=O sites leads to the for-
mation of complete oxidation products.
In a recent study [15], in which silica supported
MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts were compared, it was seen
that methane conversion appeared to be related to
disperse isolated surface metal oxide species, with
the surface vanadium oxide species being more reac-
tive than molybdenum oxide species. However, silica
supported vanadium catalysts showed lower yields
to HCOH than silica-supported molybdenum oxide
catalysts.
In addition to silica, zeolites have been used as
support. Ban
Äares et al. [17] showed that the rate of
methane conversion with molecular oxygen was found
to be dependent on the MoO3 dispersion on the US-Y
zeolite surface, whereas the selectivity towards for-
maldehyde seemed to depend on the structure of the
molybdenum phase. On the other hand, several
authors have recently reported the transformation
of methane to higher hydrocarbons and aromatics
products using Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts without adding
oxidants [18±20]. Methane oligomerization reaction
is proposed to be catalyzed by molybdenum species
located inside the zeolite channels together with
the Bro
Ènsted acid sites of HZSM-5. The use of the
HZSM-5 zeolite as a support of the metal oxide phase
is very interesting due to three reasons: its thermal
stability, the high surface area that enables high metal
oxide loading and the presence of acid sites that could
lead to the formation of certain active metal oxide
species.
On the basis of the chemical similarities between
MoO3 and WO3 it seems reasonable to expect a
parallelism in their catalytic properties. Speci®cally,
Salvati et al. [21] showed that WO3/Al2O3 catalysts
were structurally similar to MoO3/Al2O3 catalysts and
that the WO4
2ÿ interaction species closely resembled
the molybdenum±alumina surface complex.
In this paper, we report the results obtained in
the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde
over W/HZSM-5 catalysts using molecular oxygen
as oxidant. Likewise, the catalysts were characterized
in order to understand the interaction of metal oxide
phase with the support and establish the relationship
between both catalytic activity and formaldehyde
selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by hydrothermal
crystallization using ethanol as template, according to
the earlier reported procedure [22]. The product was
100% crystalline (determined by X-ray powder dif-
fraction (XRD) method) with SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio
of 90. The acid form of the zeolite was obtained by ion
exchange with an aqueous solution of HCl (0.6 N) and
then dried at 1108C for 14 h. The W/HZSM-5 cata-
lysts were prepared by aqueous impregnation of the
zeolite powder with different amounts of ammonium
meta-tungstate, (NH4)6H2W12O40xH2O, to give tung-
sten loading in the range 0.3±11.9 wt%. After 4 h of
stirring, the water was removed by evaporation under
vaccum. Next, the impregnated catalysts were cal-
cined in air at 6758C for 2.5 h. The catalysts will be
named to as ZWx where x indicates the weight per-
centage of tungsten in the catalysts. The NaZW7.1
catalysts with 7.1 wt% tungsten loading was obtained
in a way similar to the other catalysts, from the sodium
form of the ZSM-5 zeolite.

2.2. Catalytic runs
The experiments were carried out in a ®xed bed at
atmospheric pressure. The apparatus consisted of gas
feed systems for each component (methane and oxy-
gen), with individual control by mass ¯owmeters, a
®xed bed quartz reactor and an exit gas ¯owmeter.
Three heating zones were surrounding the reactor. The
temperature of each zone was independently con-
trolled within 18C by temperature controllers. The
temperature of the catalytic bed was measured by a
thermocouple placed in the center of this one. With
this reactor design a variation of only 58C was
observed along the catalytic bed. The dimensions of
the reaction zone of the reactor were i.d. 21.4 mm and
length 6 cm. Analyses of the feed and reactor ef¯uent
streams were performed by gas chromatography using
thermal conductivity detectors. A Porapak Q column
was used to separate CH4, CO2, COO2, HCOH and
water, and a molecular sieve (5 A
Ê ) packed column to
separate CO and O2. Calibration for formaldehyde was
obtained with a 40% HCOH aqueous solution.
The catalyst was pretreated in the reactor under an
oxygen ¯ow from the ambient temperature to the
reaction temperature, 6508C and held at the latter
for approximately 1 h. Space velocity of the feed
was 7.41 g h /mol and the CH4 : O2 molar ratio was
5.3 : 1. It was proven that approximately 2 h were
required to reach apparently steady conditions. Sam-
pling of the product stream was repeated until the
analytical results were reproducible. In the present
research, the carbon balance was always better than
96%.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area and micropore volumes of the
calcined samples were measured by using a Quanta-
chrome Autosorb-1 apparatus with nitrogen as the
adsorbate. XRD patterns were recorded on a Philips
PW1710 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation. UV
diffuse re¯ectance spectra (UV DRS) were performed
by using Spectralon as reference on a Perkin Elmer
Lambda-20 spectrometer equipped with a diffuse
re¯ectance accessory. The spectra were recorded
immediately after calcination of the samples. The
scanning wavelength range was 198-500 nm and the
scan speed was 120 nm min. TPR experiments were
recorded on a Micromertics TPD/TPR analyzer. The
samples were pretreated from ambient temperature to
6758C in argon ¯ow. Following pretreatment, TPR
experiments were run in a 17% H2/Ar stream
(50 Ncm3/min) heating up to 9008C at a rate of
108C/min. During this time the exit gas was monitored
using a TCD detector. Total acid site density of the
catalysts was measured by a temperature-programmed
desorption of ammonia (TPDA) by means of a Micro-
meritics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples were housed
in a quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in ¯owing
helium while heating at 158C/min to 6758C. After a
period of 30 min at 6758C, the samples were cooled at
1808C and saturated by ¯owing a pure ammonia
stream for 15 min. The catalyst was then allowed to
equilibrate under helium ¯ow at 1808C for 1 h.
Finally, the ammonia was desorbed by using a linear
heating rate of 158C/min up to 6758C. Temperature
and detector signals were simultaneously recorded.
The unique area under the curve was integrated to
determine the total acidity of the catalyst. The uptake
of ammonia is used to represent the number of strong
acid sites on the catalyst.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the supported tungsten
species
BET surface areas and micropore volumes of all
W/HZSM-5 catalysts with various tungsten loading
are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that both para-
meters decreased with increasing amounts of tungsten.
From this result we can see that the tungsten species
easily enter or partially block the channels of the
ZSM-5 zeolite and thus reduce the surface areas
and the micropore volumes of the catalysts.
The effect of tungsten loading on the acidity of the
catalysts was also studied by TPD of ammonia.
Results in Table 2 show that with the introduction
of tungsten into the HZSM-5 zeolite the number of
acid sites decreased, and the extent of the elimination
of strong acid sites increased with an increase in
tungsten loading. On the other hand, it can also be
observed in Table 2 that the maximum ammonia
desorption temperature increased with decreasing
tungsten loading. This apparent increasing in desorp-

167
tion temperature could be due to ammonia re-adsorp-
tion phenomena caused when the number of acid sites
is increased. Therefore, from TPD results in can be
concluded that the number of the acid sites decrease
when tungsten loading in the HZSM-5 zeolite is
increased. Likewise, it can be shown up that the total
acidity of NaZW9 sample is negligible.
The UV diffuse re¯ectance spectra of the W/
HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten oxide load-
ing are shown in Fig. 1. Two major bands at 220 nm
and at 310 nm can be observed for all the samples.
Likewise, a further band at about 375 n (represented as
a shoulder) is noted in the catalysts with W loading
higher than 2.4%. The assignment of these three bands
can be done by analyzing the spectra of tungsten
compounds with a known geometry. In the inset of
Fig. 1 are shown the spectra of both solid sodium
tungstate, exclusively constituted of tetrahedral tung-
sten, and ammonium metatungstate and tungsten
oxide, both mainly constituted by octahedral tungsten
(tetrahedral species are also present as terminal tung-
sten atoms). By comparing these with the W/HZSM-5
catalysts spectra, it can be concluded that the band at
220 nm could be assigned to the tetrahedrally coordi-
nated W(VI) species while the other bands at about
310 nm and about 375 nm could be assigned to octa-
hedral W(VI) species: polytungstate and WO3 crystal-
lites, respectively. This fact seems to be in good
agreement with the observation made by other authors
for silica, alumina and titania WO3 supported catalysts
[23±25].
XRD patterns of W/HZSM-5 catalysts with differ-
ent W loading calcined at 6758C are shown in Fig. 2.
Peaks corresponding to crystallites of WO3 begin to be
visible for tungsten loading higher than 4,0%, the
intensity of these peaks becoming higher with increas-

ing WO3 loading. Spencer [11], in a work carried out
over MoO3/SiO2 catalyst, observed peaks at MoO3
5.16 wt.% and above, corresponding to crystallites of
molybdenum that was 50 A
Ê or more in diameter.
This author supposed three-dimensional structures of
MoO3 to start forming at much lower coverages. On
the other hand, both Xu et al. [18] and Chen et al. [19]
detected MO3 crystallites in Mo/HZSM-5 for Mo
loading higher than 10%. According to the latter, if
the molybdenum loading were below this value, most
of the molybdenum species would be located in the
channels of the HZSM-5 zeolite while if it were above
this value, an isolated molybdenum trioxide phase and
polymolybdenum oxide species would appear. In this
way, highly dispersed species with terminal Mo=O
sites would appear at low molybdenum loading while
polymolybdenum species would be formed at high
molybdenum loading on the external surface of the
catalysts. In turn, Kohler et al. [25], in a study carried
out over tungsten oxide supported on alumina,
showed, by using Laser Raman spectroscopy, that at
low tungsten contents (2 wt.%), a surface-supported,
tetrahedrally coordinated species predominated over
the octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species
whereas at high contents (>10 wt.%) the latter pre-
dominated over the former, the crystalline WO3 being
only present in small amounts at higher contents. This
general picture is in good agreement with UV DRS
measurements. On the other hand, since UV diffuse
re¯ectance band at 375 nm is presumably related to
the existence of WO3 crystallites, it can be veri®ed
from Fig. 1 that the formation of these starts at lower
coverages that 7,1 wt.%.
TPR pro®les of the W/HZSM-5 catalysts and the
bulk WO3 are given in Fig. 3. As we can see all the
curves contain several peaks in the temperature range
300±9008C. TPR pro®le of bulk WO3 exhibits two
peaks at 6558C and 7408C. For all the supported
catalysts a ®rst peak appears at 530±5908C although
it is overlapped by the second peak for tungsten
loading above 4.0%. This second peak with a max-
imum at 630±6408C appears for tungsten loading
above 2.4% being the most intense for these samples.
A third peak at 6708C, represented as a shoulder, is
seen for catalysts with a tungsten loading higher than
7.1%. Finally, for ZW11.9 catalyst a further well-
de®ned peak at 7508C is observed. The appearance
of TPR peaks at higher temperatures is related to the
decrease in the dispersion of the tungsten oxide spe-
cies (namely, polytungstate and WO3 crystallites). In

fact, the TPR pro®le of the highest loaded sample
closely resembles the bulk tungsten oxide pro®le. The
relative reducibility of the catalysts (de®ned as H2
consumption per mol of tungsten for the sample to H2
consumption per mol of tungsten for the bulk WO3
ratio) as a function of the W loading is shown in Fig. 4.
An increase in this parameter for the higher-loaded
catalysts is observed indicating that the aggregation of
the tungsten oxide species results in a signi®cant
increase of the degree of reduction of the tungsten
species. This fact implies that the dispersed tungsten
oxide species are less reducible probably due to the
oxide-support interaction is stronger than that of the
bulk tungsten oxide. These results con®rm those
obtained with XRD and UV DRS studies. Similar
®ndings have been reported by Faraldos et al. for
MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [15].
Fig. 5 shows the UV diffuse re¯ectance spectrum of
the NaZW9 catalyst compared with that correspond-
ing to ZW9 catalyst spectrum. It can be seen that both
spectra are different indicating that the presence of the
acid sites of the zeolite is closely related to the nature
of the tungsten oxide species.
3.2. Methane oxidation
The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with
molecular oxygen over W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to
the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O. Fig. 6
shows methane conversion, HCOH selectivity and
space±time yield (STY) of formaldehyde for all the
catalysts. Table 3 shows the methane conversion and
product selectivities for the W/HZSM-5 catalysts,
together with the results obtained in the uncatalytic

W/HZSM-5 catalysts.

reaction using a CSi bed (blank experiment), and those
with NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5.
In Table 3 it can be observed that the contribution of
the homogenious reaction is not negligible in the
experimental conditions used in this work, since a
methane conversion equal to 1.8% to oxides of carbon
is obtained with the blank experiment. This fact points
out the relevance of gas-phase reaction in initiating
methane conversion at high temperature [26]. Like-
wise, HZSM-5 zeolite shows a great activity in the
oxidation of methane leading to the formation of total
oxidation products, mainly carbon monoxide. By
contrast, NaZSM-5 zeolite shows much lower activity
and CO selectivity. According to the literature [18,19],
this fact implies that the acid centers of the HZSM-5
are active sites for methane activation.
As may be seen from Fig. 6, for the W/HZSM-5
catalysts, methane conversion increases with increas-
ing tungsten loading although this increase is very low
for 2.4±11.9% W loading. Formaldehyde selectivity
increases for catalysts from 0.3% to 2.4% tungsten
content, whereas it decreases slightly up to 11.9 wt.%.
As a result, the space±time yield of formaldehyde
passes through a maximum at about 7.1 wt.% of
tungsten loading.
From Table 3 it can be observed that for tungsten
content higher than 0.8% carbon monoxide selectivity
increased and, as a consequence, carbon dioxide
selectivity decreases with increasing tungsten loading.
The anomalous result for ZW0.3 catalyst (in terms of
CO and CO2 selectivities) can be explained on the
basis that at very low tungsten loading, important parts
of the zeolite pores are not blocked by the tungsten
species. Therefore, methane activation can occur both
on active sites of the HZSM-5 (leading to CO forma-
tion) and on the supported oxide phase. In this table,
the result obtained with the NaZW7.1 catalyst is also
included. Both methane conversion and HCOH selec-
tivity are much lower than those obtained with the
corresponding ZW7.1 catalyst.
4. Discussion
4.1. Nature of the supported species
According to the results reported for silica, alumina
and titania WO3 supported catalysts, three types of
tungsten species may be formed: isolated tetrahedra

species grafted to the support, surface poly-

meric species such as polytungstates with W(VI) in
octahedral coordination and WO3 crystallites [21,23±
25,27].
The UV diffuse re¯ectance spectra (Fig. 1) show
that these three species are formed in the W/HZSM-5
catalyst, although the relative amount of each one
varies signi®cantly with the tungsten loading. So, for
tungsten loading lower than 4.0%, monomeric species
are predominant though polymeric species and WO3
crystallites (W loading higher than 2.4%) are present
to a minor extent. Due to their large size (the size of
polytungstate species is about 2 nm, higher than the
size of the HZSM-5 pores), these latter species are
mainly formed on the external surface of the zeolite
and highly dispersed at lower tungsten loading. Like-
wise, the observed decrease in the BET area (Table 1)
suggests that some of the polymeric species could be
located in the entrance of the channels of the HZSM-5
zeolite blocking them up. When the tungsten loading
is above 4.0%, an increase in the amount of polymeric
species is observed. Thereby, the external surface of
the zeolite is gradually covered leading to the blocking
of the HZSM-5 channels to a large extent. This fact
can be con®rmed by a drastic decrease in BETarea for
tungsten loading above 7.1 wt.%. Similar observation
has been reported for Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [18,19].
Likewise, an increase in tungsten loading produces an
increase in the degree of aggregation of the polymeric
species, so that the size of WO3 crystallites is big
enough to be detected by means of XRD (Fig. 2).
The decrease in the dispersion of the tungsten oxide
species due to the formation of the polytungstate
species can be qualitatively seen by plotting the UV
absorbances at 220 and 310 nm ratio (A220/A310) as a
function of the tungsten concentration (Fig. 7). For
low tungsten loadings (0.3±2.4%) this ratio increases
slightly with a maximum for ZW2.4 catalyst indicat-
ing that the formation of monomeric tetrahedral spe-
cies is higher than that of polytungstate ones. For
higher tungsten loading the ratio A220/A310 decreases
markedly due to an increase in the degree of poly-
merization leading to a lesser-dispersed tungsten
oxide phase. This interpretation is consistent with
the TPR results and with the formation of WO3
crystallites observed for W loading higher than 4.0%.
On the other hand, owing to the small size of the
tetrahedral species (<2 A
Ê ), it is very likely these ones
to be mainly formed by grafting of the tungsten oxide
species with the Bro
Ènsted acid sites located inside the
pores of the HZSM-5. This phenomena would be
analogous to the grafting of the WO2ÿ
4
ions with
OH groups of silica and alumina [21,27,28]. Mulcahy
et al. [29], showed that Mo7O6ÿ
24 and W12O6ÿ
39 ions
produce loosely and tightly bound surface species on
Fig. 7. Influence of tungsten loading on absorbances at 220 and 310 nm ratio.

alumina. Both loosely and tightly bound species
would appear by electrostatic adsorption and conden-
sation, respectively, on surface hydroxyls. If a similar
mechanism of supporting is supposed, the polytung-
state species, due to their size, would be preferentially
located on the external surface of zeolite. The results
of total acidity measured by ammonia TPD seem to
support these conclusions. At low tungsten loading
(0.3±0.8%) the decrease in the number of acid sites
will mainly be due to the grafting of tungsten species
with the Bro
Ènsted acid sites. When tungsten loading
increases, a decrease in the acidity probably due to the
deposition of the tungsten species over the acid sites
together with the blocking of the channels is observed.
This latter effect would be the most important at the
highest loading. Again, these observations are in
agreement with the observed for Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst
[18,19].
The analysis of the UV diffuse re¯ectance spectra of
the NaZW7.1 catalyst (Fig. 5) seems to be contra-
dictory. This catalyst has no acid site since it has not
been ion exchanged. Therefore, the formation of the
tetrahedral monomeric species is not expected. How-
ever, the most intense band in the spectra is at about
220 nm corresponding to this type of species; the band
around 310 nm corresponding to octahedral the poly-
meric species being practically a shoulder of the
former band. According to the observations reported
for alkali-doped V2O5 and MoO3 silica supported
catalysts [16,30], the major part of the tetrahedral
species may be attributed to the formation of surface
sodium tungstate species. The remaining tungstate
would be minor amounts of tetrahedral monomers
grafted to the zeolite and octahedral polymeric
species.
4.2. The changes in the supported species during
preparation stage
It is well known that in aqueous solution the struc-
ture of the tungstate ion is pH-dependent [21,29].
According to the equilibrium
12WO2ÿ
4
 12H @ W12O12ÿ
42
 6H2O
tungsten exists exclusively as the tetrahedral ion in
neutral and alkaline solution. In acidic solution the
predominant species is the octahedral W12O12ÿ
42 . These
species are predominant in the ammonium metatung-
state solution used in the impregnation step, since a pH
value of 3.9 was found. During the impregnation
stage, these species, due to their large size, would
be mainly adsorbed on the positive sites of the external
surface of HZSM-5 zeolite as a result of the charge
interaction [9]. In fact, in the UV diffuse re¯ectance
spectrum of the uncalcined catalysts (Fig. 8) a band at
about 265±300 nm corresponding to these species can
be observed. The observed shift of this band to lower
wavelengths is attributed to the (in order to avoid
changes in supported species) spectrum of uncalcined
catalyst which was not registered in dehydrated con-
ditions. However, simultaneously to this band, the
spectrum shows a band at 220 nm corresponding to
monomeric species. This fact indicates that during the
impregnation stage, some tungsten species enter the
channels of the zeolite and interact with the Bro
Ènsted
acid centers forming tetrahedral WO2ÿ
4
species. This
aspect is quite different from that observed for WO3/
Al2O3 catalyst, in which these species are only formed
during the calcination stage [21].
It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the amount of the
different tungsten species changes signi®cantly during
Fig. 8. UV diffuse reflectance spectra of (a) uncalcined (sample
after tungsten impregnation, not further dried or calcined) and (b)
calcined ZW7.1 catalyst.

the calcination. The amount of the polytungstate
species decreases whereas tetrahedral species slightly
increases and the WO3 crystallites appear. This fact
involves that some of the polymeric species formed in
the impregnation stage may partially decompose upon
calcination into tungstate trioxide. Furthermore, redis-
persion of polymeric species over the zeolite surface
may occur in some extent. These results would be in
good agreement with the reported for HZSM-5 and
HY supported MoO3 catalysts [17±19].
4.3. Catalytic activity
The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane
to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica
supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated
[13,15,31±34]. However, the participation of lattice or
surface activated gas-phase oxygen in the formalde-
hyde formation is not clear. It seems that the oxygen
activation over the catalyst surface plays a fundamen-
tal role in the catalytic reation. The interaction of
oxygen with the catalyst activates oxygen making it
more reactive thus promoting methane activation
[15,32±34]. Likewise, methane can be converted into
radicals by reaction with oxygen in the gas phase or in
presence of catalyst thus initiating the reaction
[26,31]. An analogous mechanisms may be assumed
for the oxygen activation in the partial oxidation of
methane over W/HZSM-5 catalysts.
On the other hand, it has been reported that both
active oxygen ions and Bro
Ènsted acidic sites on
HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation
[18,19]. This fact explains the difference between
the results obtained in this work for the NaZSM-5
and HZSM-5 zeolites. Moreover, the active sites of the
HZSM-5 lead to CO selectively and no formaldehyde
formation is observed. So, it is clear that the active
centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over
W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase.
Thus, for the lowest tungsten loaded catalysts (ZW0.3)
the HCOH yield is noticeable. The decrease in
methane conversion with respect to the HZSM-5
support obtained for the low loaded catalysts (up to
2.4%) could be due to the partial blocking of the active
centers of the zeolite. For higher tungsten loading
methane conversion increases indicating that the sur-
face tungsten oxide phase generates own active sites
able to activate gas-phase oxygen. In Fig. 9 are pre-
sented methane and formaldehyde turnover frequency
(TOF) values (mol CH4 converted or mol HCOH
formed/mol W s) as a function of the tungsten loading.
The TOF values have been calculated under the
assumption that all the supported metal is active.
Supporting the above hypothesis it can be seen that

methane TOF decreases sharply up to 2.4% tungsten
loading and slightly for higher loading. These obser-
vations are in agreement with the reported by Miceli
et al. for V2O5/SiO2 [35]. Formaldehyde TOF also
decreases sharply up to 2.4%, this decrease then being
very low. This trend can be attributed to the increase in
the amount of polymeric tungsten oxide species in the
catalyst with increasing tungsten loading. It causes
both an increase in the aggregation of polymeric
tungsten species, lessening the number of exposed
tungsten sites, and a decrease in the dispersion.
Ban
Äares et al. [14] reported that the presence of highly
dispersed polymolybdate structures on silica surface is
closely related to formaldehyde selectivity. Likewise,
Irusta et al. [16] has related formaldehyde selectivity
with the presence of V=O bonds of tetrahedral mono-
meric species of vanadium directly bonded to the
support.
In this work the observed HCOH selectivity (Fig. 7)
shows a trend with increasing tungsten loading very
similar to that of the UV adsorbances at 220 and
310 nm ratio (Fig. 8). This fact implies that the for-
maldehyde selectivity depends on the dispersion of
tungsten species. Thus, for tungsten loading up to
2.4% the progressive formation of dispersed both
tetrahedral monomeric and polytungstate species
leads to an increase in HCOH selectivity. Moreover,
these latter species possess terminal W=O sites that
could be the active centers for formaldehyde produc-
tion. For higher loadings, the dispersion decreases
mainly due to the growth of the polymeric WO3
species. As a consequence, formaldehyde selectivity
decreased slightly for tungsten loading from 2.4 to
11.9. The low value of HCOH selectivity obtained
with NaZW7.1 catalyst would be due (according to the
literature ®ndings for alkali-doped supported MoO3
and V2O5 silia catalysts [16,30]) to the decrease in the
dispersion of the supported oxide phase produced by
surface sodium tungstate species.
Finally, from the results reported in this work, the
mechanisms of formation of the total oxidation
products does not seem to be clear. The presence of
W±O±W bonds of polytungstate and bulk WO3 could
lead to carbon oxides formation from both methane
and formaldehyde in a manner similar to that of V2O5/
SiO2 and MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [13,16]. However,
other factors such as further oxidation of formalde-
hyde in gas phase cannot be discarded.
5. Conclusions
Three different types of supported tungsten species
are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahe-
dral W2ÿ
4 species probably grafted to the Bro
Ènsted acid
sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such
as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites. The relative
amounts of these three types of species changes sig-
ni®cantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of
tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are
mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For
higher loading the amount and the size of the poly-
tungstate
species
increases
gradually
causing
a
decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking
up of the HZMS-5 zeolite. Likewise, it has been
demonstrated that in the calcination step a partial
redistribution of the tungsten species is produced.
The catalytic result point out that the W/HZSM-5
catalyst is active for the partial oxidation to methane to
formaldehyde. HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity
in methane conversion but does not lead to formalde-
hyde production. Formaldehyde selectivity seems to
be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide
phase, which, in turn, is in¯uenced by the metal
loading.
