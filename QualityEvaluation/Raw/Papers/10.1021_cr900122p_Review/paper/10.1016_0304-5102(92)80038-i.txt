Rez07 supported on alumina is one of the most active catalysts of 
practical use for the metathesis of oleilns [ 21. However, the exact coordination 
sphere of rhenium in the active species is as yet uncertain. This system 
becomes even more active, especially for the metathesis of functionalized 
oleflns, when treated with tetraall@tin complexes SnR, (R= CHa, n-C4H9, 
etc. . . . ) [3]. Since Re,O, is known to react with Sn(CH& to form CH3Re03 
(MTO) [4], it was suggested that the latter rhenium-alkyl complex could be 
an intermediate in the heterogeneous system. In solution, MT0 is active for 
the metathesis of cyclic and acyclic oleflns only in the presence of a Lewis 
acid and an alkylating agent. However, when supported on y-alumina and 
silica-ahnnina, it becomes an efficient metathesis catalyst, even for func- 
tionalized oleflns [5]. More recently, a third very active system was found 
for acyclic oleflns, namely MT0 supported on niobium oxide [6]. In this last 
case, it was observed that the organic ligand of MT0 remains on the surface: 
the question then arises as to whether this fragment is a methylene ligand 
or a methyl spectator ligand.

To test this hypothesis, the catalyst MTO/Nbz05(300)* was exposed to 
the symmetrical olefln, trans-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene. 
If a methylene species 
is present on the surface, the formation of only 3-methyl-1-butene should 
be observed, according to eqn. (1):

Formation of 3-methyl-1-butene (co. 0.07 mol per mol grafted Re) is indeed 
observed. However, two C, olellns, u&z. 2,4-dimethyl-2-pentene 
(identified 
by GC-MS) and probably 5-methyl-2-hexene, and isobutene were also detected; 
these products cannot be accounted for by eqn. (1). Moreover, when the 
precursor complex MT0 was labelled (99% enriched 13CH3Re03), GC-MS 
analysis revealed that 3-methyl-1-butene was not labelled**. The reaction in 
eqn. (2) thus did not occur on MTO/Nb205:

It must therefore be concluded that the formation of the first metal- 
lacarbene, at least in the case of MTO/Nbz06, does not arise from the methyl 
group but most likely from the olefin itself. Among all the mechanisms already 
proposed in the literature for the formation of a carbene surface species in 
the case of heterogeneous catalysts [8], only a ~-ally1 mechanism [ 
91 
would 
explain the formation of unlabelled. 3-methyl-l -butene (Scheme 1). According 
to this mechanism, after coordination of the olefin and formation of the r- 
ally1 intermediate, the resulting metallacyclobutane (1) 
should lead to the 
formation of isobutene and 3-methyl-1-butene. Isomerization can occur leading 
to the metallacyclobutane (2), which then leads to the formation of propene 
and 5-methyl-hexene. Under our reaction conditions, 3-methyl-1-butene was 
by far the major reaction product. This may mean that pathway (b) is largely

Niobium oxide, NbzOs*nHzO,

after cooling to room temperature, 
it was contacted with water (22 torr) for cu. 3 h and then 
evacuated 
at 300 “C overnight

was prepared by in situ sublimation 
at room temperature (lo-*

GG-MS analysis.

favored. Only traces of propene could be detected. Formation of small 
amounts of 2,5-dimethyl-2-pentene could result from the secondary reaction 
between the initially formed rhenium-isopropylidene 
complex and 2,5-di- 
methylhexene (eqn. (3)).

Based on this mechanism and on the amount of 3-methyl-l-butene formed, 
we can estimate that at least 7% of the rhenium surface species are active 
sites. 
Upon formulating such a mechanism, one implicitly assumes that, at 
the surface of niobium oxide, some of the rhenium has reached a lower 
oxidation state, which must be equal or lower than +V in order to allow 
the formation of a metallacycle, which will bring the rhenium back to the 
oxidation state +VII. A preliminary analysis of MTO/Nb20s by ESCA indeed 
LlO 
reveals the presence of reduced rhenium on the surface, which could be 
either Re(V) or Re(lV); the number of these reduced species decreases after 
reaction with an olefln.
