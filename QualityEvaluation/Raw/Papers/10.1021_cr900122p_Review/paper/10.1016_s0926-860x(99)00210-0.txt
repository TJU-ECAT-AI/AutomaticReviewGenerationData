Abstract
The effective activation and direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons is a topic of great challenge in catalysis
science. Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to
produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous ﬂow mode has attracted signiﬁcant interest since 1993. This
paper reviews the recent advances in catalytic dehydro-aromatization of methane over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts without the use
of oxidants. The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modiﬁcation of catalysts
and optimization of reaction conditions. The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal
ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are
discussed. ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction and background
Methane is the major component of natural gas
as well as coal mine release gas. It is also avail-
able in rather large quantities either as an undesirable
by-product or as a component of an off-gas from cer-
tain processes. It acts as a greenhouse gas resulting in
atmospheric pollution. Hence, catalytic conversion of
methane to desirable chemical products or liquid fuel
is a great challenge to catalytic chemists. This conver-
sion will improve the quality of living of mankind, as
well as utilize methane containing resources in gen-
eral and natural gas resources, in particular. On the

other hand, methane is the most stable and symmet-
ric organic molecule consisting of four C–H cova-
lence bonds with bond energy of 435 kJ/mol. Accord-
ingly, the effective activation and direct conversion of
methane are also a great challenge in the science of
catalysis.
In homogeneous catalysis, it is likely that a tran-
sition metal carbene-like complex intermediate and a
super-acid medium are crucial for methane activation.
It was ﬁrst reported that methane can be activated and
made to proceed in the homologation reaction in a
super-acid medium as early as the 1970s [1–3]. Ex-
tensive research has been undertaken along this line;
for example, see Periana’s work [4,5]. In recent years,
the direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocar-
bons has been extensively studied in heterogeneous

catalysis. Since 1982, the most intensive impact is the
work on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) in
a co-feed mode with oxygen. Methane molecules are
activated via homolytic splitting on the catalyst surface
to form methyl radicals. This results from its interac-
tion with the surface oxygen species, most likely in the
form of O−, as suggested by Lunsford [6]. The basic-
ity of a catalyst for the OCM is of signiﬁcance since
most of the catalysts, which are active for the reaction,
are composed of or modiﬁed by alkali and alkali earth
metal compounds. Focusing on the importance of the
basicity of the catalysts, an alternative mechanism pro-
posed for the activation of methane was put forward
[7]. It was suggested that methane was ﬁrst heterolyt-
ically split into CH3−and H+ on the catalyst surface,
and then the CH3−species are transformed to methyl
radicals. In this case, the methyl radicals still play a
key role in the OCM. However, after intensive efforts
from catalytic chemists worldwide for about 18 years,
no catalysts could reach a C2 yields beyond 25% and a
selectivity to C2 higher than 80%, is the principal cri-
teria for industrial application of the OCM. Anyway, it
is interesting to note that acidity and heterolytic split-
ting of methane are both important factors in the ac-
tivation of methane in homogeneous catalysis, while
basicity and homolytic splitting play key roles in the
activation of methane in heterogeneous catalysis.
Transformation of methane to aromatics is thermo-
dynamically more favorable than the transformation of
methane to ethylene, extensive efforts have also been
devoted to the direct conversion along this line in het-
erogeneous catalysis. Similar to OCM, methane direct
transformation into aromatics with the participation
of oxygen is thermodynamically favorable. However,
the reaction of methane with O2 to form CO2 and
H2O is thermodynamically much more favorable than
the direct transformation of methane into aromatics.
Many approaches have been tested and investigated
in order to control and limit the total oxidation of
methane. In 1983, Shepelev et al. [8] and Anderson et
al. [9] reported that trace aromatics could be detected
if CH4 reacted with O2 and/or NO over ZSM-5 and
HZSM-5 zeolite, but the main products would be CO2,
CO and H2O. Han et al. reported that CH4 reacted
with O2 in the presence of propane to form aromat-
ics over HZSM-5 catalyst at 723 K [10]. In an attempt
to avoid the use of oxygen in the gas phase, a few
papers reported that methane reacted with lattice oxy-
gen or strongly adsorbed oxygen on oxide catalysts to
form aromatics. Ismailov et al. found that, by using
their temperature programmed reaction technique un-
der high temperature, the lattice oxygen of Re/Al2O3
and Pt-Re/Al2O3 catalysts was active for the methane
transformation into aromatics [11]. Abasov et al. re-
ported that methane reacted with strongly adsorbed
oxygen on Ni/Al2O3, and the selectivity to benzene
was about 75% at the methane conversion of 7% [12].
Claridge et al. [13] claimed that at 1223 K the conver-
sion of methane–oxygen mixtures to aromatics over
K/BaCO3 and/or NaCl/MnO2 catalysts was about 13%
with the selectivity to aromatics of 18–23%. The au-
thors also suggested that the formation of aromatics
possibly proceeded via ethylene intermediate.
Several researchers tried to ﬁnd a way to trans-
form methane into higher hydrocarbons in the absence
of oxygen. Mitchell et al. [14] reported that if CH4
passed over a M/M′On/M′′O multi-component cata-
lyst (M was precious metal, M′ was a VIB element,
M′′ was an IIA element) at 977 K for 30 min, ben-
zene could be detected in the product. They proposed
that M/M′On/M′′O is a multi-functional catalyst. First,
methane dissociated on M metal to form M–CHx, and
then went to form ethane and ethylene, and reacted
with metallic oxide to form metallic carbide. Second,
the carbide transformed into benzene via ethylene or
the carbide reacted with methane to form benzene,
and/or the carbonaceous deposit reacted with M–H
to form benzene were proposed. Belgued et al. [15]
found methane could transform into higher hydrocar-
bons over a supported Pt catalyst via a two-step route.
Methane ﬁrst dissociated on the precious metal to form
carbide and H2, and then, the carbide hydrogenated
by H2 to produce higher hydrocarbons. Koerts et al.
[16] reported that methane transformed into higher hy-
drocarbons over metal via the same two-step route.
Tanaka et al. showed that methane dissociated on a
Co metal catalyst to form CHx, and the CHx further
reacted with H2 to produce C2+ [17]. Bragin et al. re-
ported the aromatization reaction of methane to ben-
zene in a pulse-reactor over Pt-CrO3/HZSM-5 catalyst
at 1023 K [18]. The selectivity to benzene of 80% at
a methane conversion of 18% was achieved in their
pulse-reactor mode.
In 1993, Wang et al. [19] reported on the
dehydro-aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing
condition in a ﬂow reactor mode on HZSM-5 zeolite

catalysts modiﬁed with transition metal ions (TMI).
The HZSM-5 zeolite offers an acid solution-like en-
vironment in the solid form, and the mechanism of
methane activation over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts was
discussed in more detail along the same line as in
homogeneous catalysis. Since then, many researchers
have paid attention to this process and made encour-
aging progress. To date, the research work on this
reaction can categorize primarily into the following
four parts:
(a) Modiﬁcation of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts and opti-
mization of reaction conditions,
(b) Study of the interactions between the TMI com-
ponent and the zeolite support,
(c) Active sites (or active phases) and reaction mech-
anisms,
(d) The formation of carbonaceous deposits and their
role in the reaction.
Recently, great attention has been focused on zeolite
supported catalysts [20–23] since their framework
can stabilize the TMI loading, especially when the
TMI migrates into intra-crystalline zeolite cavities
and/or channels. On the other hand, by combining
acid sites with TMI, one can build up a series of bi-
and/or multi-functional catalysts with unique catalytic
properties. For example, the direct transformation
of methane into aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 cata-
lysts in the absence of oxygen is a typical example
of these catalytic properties. Because of the great
signiﬁcance of zeolite supported catalysts in hetero-
geneous catalysis, an extensive amount of work is
in the literature. All this research certainly offered
necessary knowledge and useful background for the
study of the methane aromatization over TMI mod-
iﬁed zeolite catalysts in the absence of oxygen. For
example, Agudo et al. [22] studied the surface prop-
erties of Molybdenum-impregnated ZSM-5 catalysts.
The authors came to the conclusion that the zeolite
crystallinity is mostly preserved for the high Mo
loading catalysts, and that most of the molybdena
appears as MoO3 crystals on the external zeolite
surface. To concentrate our attention on methane
dehydro-aromatization over TMI modiﬁed zeolite
catalysts in the absence of oxygen in a continuous
ﬂow reactor mode in this review, we will summarize
the results reported in the literature since 1993. We
will discuss fundamental points of the reaction that
might be commonly accepted. We will focus on the
above mentioned four aspects which are closely re-
lated to the methane dehydro-aromatization over TMI
modiﬁed HZSM-5 catalysts as studied since 1993.
2. Modiﬁcation of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts and
optimization of reaction conditions
Many researchers have evaluated a lot of catalysts,
intending to get higher reactivity, stability and/or
selectivity to aromatics. The main results are listed
in Tables 1 and 2. In the early stage of the studies
on the titled reaction, Xu et al. and Lin et al. used
conventional GC analysis method, monitoring the
tail-gas with ﬂame ionization detector or thermal
conductivity detector [19,24–26]. In both cases the
carbonaceous deposits which were heavily formed
during the reactions were neglected, as listed in Table
1. It was claimed that for the conversion of methane
to benzene in the absence of oxidants, the best cat-
alyst was Mo/HZSM-5 prepared by impregnation.
They also concluded that the channel structure and
acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence
and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the
catalytic performance [25].
Meanwhile, Solymosi et al. [27–30] evaluated
many catalysts prepared from different Mo precursors
(MoO3, K2MoO4, Mo2C, Mo, MoO2, mooch(1−x))
and supports (Sioux, Al2O3, HZSM-5, TiO2, MgO)
on the basis of H2 and H2O balance (see Table 2).
They found that the best support was HZSM-5 zeo-
lite, and the method of catalyst preparation affected
the performance dramatically. The result reported by
Lunsford et al. [31,32] is of signiﬁcance. They ﬁrst
noticed and analyzed the production of naphthalene
and quantitatively corrected the coke formation by an
on-line GC analysis, using N2 as internal standard.
Following the analysis method of the reaction tail-gas,
as reported by Lunsford et al. [31,32], one can es-
timate on-line the amount of carbonaceous deposits.
The groups of Solymosi and Lunsford claimed that
the reaction proceeds with an induction period, and
the reduction of Mo6+ to a lower oxidation state oc-
curs and carbon is deposited during the early stage of
contact of CH4 with the catalyst. Following an initial
induction period, a benzene selectivity of 60–65% at a
methane conversion of 7–12% was achieved with the
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. Lin et al. veriﬁed these results
in their laboratory, using the data of materials balance

obtained from analysis of the collected products from
a 20 ml bench scale reactor [33]. Later, Lunsford et
al. paid more attention to the nature of TMI (with
TMI = Mo, Fe, V, W and Cr), the preparation and
treatment method, the TMI loading, and the zeolite
acidity in their detailed studies on the conversion of
methane to benzene (see Table 2) [34]. They found
that the activity decreased in the following order:
Mo(18.3) > W(10.8) > Fe(5.7) > V(3.9) > Cr(1.5).

tion rates of CH4 expressed in molecules reacted

per metal atom per hour. It was claimed that im-
pregnated materials always had a higher activ-
ity and shorter initial induction period than solid
state ion-exchanged materials. The authors pointed
out that for samples prepared by the impregnation
method, the supported TMI are mainly located at
the external surface and only a fraction of them
diffused into the channels of the zeolite. Then,
Zeng et al. [35] reported that W–H2SO4/HZSM-5
was a highly active and heat-resisting catalyst for
methane aromatization. The authors claimed that over
a 2.5% W–1.5% Zn–H2SO4/HZSM-5 catalyst and
under reaction conditions of 1123 K, 0.1 Mpa, and
GHSV = 1500 ml/g cat h, methane conversion reached
23% with the selectivity to benzene at about 96%.
Unfortunately, since methane conversion and product
selectivity were calculated upon the carbon number
basis, the part of methane converted to coke was ne-
glected. Therefore, the results may be incomparable
with others, considering that heavy carbonaceous de-
posits must be formed on the catalyst surface during
the reaction as high as 1123 K.
From the above results, we can see that among all
the tested catalysts, one of the best is Mo/HZSM-5.
The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite
and the valence and location of Mo species are the cru-
cial factors for the catalytic performance [25]. Mean-
while, the loading of Mo metal component [24,25,36]
and the calcined temperature [25,36] are also impor-
tant factors.
The addition of a second metal component also ex-
erts inﬂuence on the performance of the Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst as shown in Table 3. Xu et al. [37,38] stud-
ied methane conversion under a lower temperature
(923 K) and found that the addition of W or Zr in-
creased methane conversion and selectivity to aromat-
ics, while the addition of V had the opposite effect.
Lin et al. [24] found that the acidity and reactivity
of Mo/HZSM-5 decreased when Li or P was used to
modify the catalyst. The existence of Li also could de-
crease the selectivity towards benzene, but could in-
crease that towards ethylene. When they loaded Pt on
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, the coke deposit decreased sig-
niﬁcantly, so that the stability of the catalyst increased
[39]. Xu et al. [40] tested Mo-Ru/HZSM-5 catalysts.
They suggested that the existence of Ru could promote
the reduction of the Mo species and the dehydrogena-
tion of methane, so that the methane conversion rate in-
creased from 10.17 to 14.54 nmol/m2 s, and aromatics
formation rate increased from 1.52 to 2.22 nmol/m2 s.
Meanwhile, the authors found that the impregnation
consequence of the metal components also exhibited
great inﬂuence. Ichikawa et al. [41] observed that over
Fe or Co modiﬁed Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, the rate of
formation of aromatics increased, while the selectivity
to coke decreased signiﬁcantly (from 31 to 21%).
Many researchers conﬁrmed that HZSM-5 is the
best support for methane dehydro-aromatization. Lin
et al. recently studied the methane aromatization over
Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of ze-
olites in more detail [42]. The activities of various Mo
modiﬁed catalysts were in the following order:
Mo/H-ZSM-11 > Mo/H-ZSM-5 > Mo/H-ZSM-8
> Mo/H-β > Mo/H-MCM-41 > Mo/H-SAPO-34
> Mo/H-mordenite ∼Mo/H-X > Mo/H-Y
> Mo/H-SAPO-5 > Mo/H-SAPO-5
> Mo/H-SAPO-11.
The authors correlated the catalytic performance
to their structure of the zeolites and came to the
conclusion that the silica–alumina zeolite with two-
dimensional structure and a pore size near to the
dynamic diameter of benzene are ﬁne supports of Mo-
based catalysts for methane dehydro-aromatization.
In summary, for methane dehydro-aromatization the
HZSM-5 zeolite is one of the best supports, and the
best TMI component is Mo. The loading of Ru, Pt,
W, Zr, Co, Fe, and Cr can enhance the reactivity
and/or stability of the catalysts, while the addition of
V, Li, and P has the opposite inﬂuence. In addition, the
preparation method, the consequence of impregnation
of the metal components, and the calcined tempera-
ture, etc. can also affect the performance.
Optimization of reaction conditions has also been
extensively studied. All the experiments showed that
various pre-treatments and different reaction condi-
tions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38]
and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature
[25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity
[24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great
inﬂuences on the catalytic performance.
In addition, some researchers have explored the
inﬂuence of the presence of other light hydrocarbons
in the methane feedstock. Pierella et al. [44] observed

that natural gas could be converted to higher hydro-
carbons under lower temperatures (773–873 K) over
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. Choudhary et al. [45] found
that methane could be highly activated, yielding a
high rate of conversion to higher hydrocarbons at
low temperatures (673 –873 K) by its reaction over
H-galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite
in the presence of alkenes or higher alkanes. They
suggested that the methane activation resulted from
its hydrogen-transfer reaction with alkenes or higher
alkanes.
3. Study of the interactions between the TMI
component and the zeolite support
The catalytic system of methane dehydro-aromatiz-
ation is relatively simple at a ﬁrst glance. Methane
is the sole reactant and the most active catalyst is
Mo/HZSM-5. The catalyst consists of two compo-
nents, Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite, each of which
has already been well studied because of their exten-
sive utilization in the ﬁeld of heterogeneous catalysis.
However, since the catalyst is calcined at high temper-
atures and the reaction is carried out at 973 K, various
kinds of interaction may happen during the catalyst
preparation and reaction, which make it more difﬁ-
cult to study. For example, the interaction between Mo
species and acid sites, and between Mo species and
framework Al, the reduction of Mo species by CH4
and the heavy carbonaceous deposits usually occur-
ring during the reaction process, may have a serious
effect on the catalytic behavior.
The interaction between the Mo species and
HZSM-5 is of special signiﬁcance for the under-
standing of methane dehydro-aromatization over
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. Such an interaction can be
addressed in terms of at least two different aspects.
One is the interaction between the Mo species and
the framework Al, and the other is the interaction
between the Mo species and the acid sites. Xu et al.
[25] conducted XRD and BET measurements on the
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, and the results showed that
Mo species were highly dispersed in the channel of
the HZSM-5 zeolite, resulting from the interaction
between the Mo species and the zeolite. This inter-
action also led to a decrease in the crystallinity of
the zeolite. Later, they characterized the interaction
at different stages of catalyst preparation by FT-IR
spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA),
temperature programmed decomposition (TPDE) and
NH3-TPD [46,47]. They found that if Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts are calcined at a proper temperature such
as at 773 K the Mo species would interact with the
acid sites (mainly Bronsted acid sites) and part of
them would move into the channel. If the catalyst is
calcined at 973 K, strong interaction between the Mo
species and framework Al will occur. This leads to the
formation of MoO42−species, which is detrimental
to methane activation. Xu’s group [46] investigated
the active Mo species by combining the NH4OH
extraction method with XRD, BET, NH3-TPD and
TPR analyses. The speciﬁc surface areas decreased
with increasing Mo loading. Mo species preferred to
deposit on the strong acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeo-
lite. The results of NH4OH extraction suggested that
there are several kinds of Mo species deposited on

the surface. One species is the octahedrally coordi-
nated MoO3 crystallites and their aggregates, which
are dissolvable in NH4OH solution and are active for
the titled reaction. Another is the tetrahedrally co-
ordinated Al2(MoO4)3 and MoO42−species, which
are insoluble and less active. They further studied
the interaction by high-resolution solid state Nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer with an 27Al and/or
29Si probe [47]. The results showed that there is a
strong interaction between Mo species and the frame-
work Al of the HZSM-5 zeolite. The framework Al
in the zeolite could be easily extracted by the intro-
duction of Mo species, and this extractability would
increase with increasing Mo loading and the calcina-
tion temperature. The extraction process would lead
to the formation of non-framework Al at ﬁrst and
then to a new crystalline phase of Al2(MoO4)3. In
the case of high Mo loading and calcination at a high
temperature, all the Al in the framework would be
extracted so that the catalyst is deactivated. Xu et al.
have recently shown by NH3-TPD that after introduc-
ing Mo species onto HZSM-5, the NH3 desorption
peak at high temperatures (which refers to the strong
sites) decreased more than the NH3 desorption peak
at low temperatures, while a peak at medium temper-
ature developed [36–38]. The change implies that a
new kind of acid site was developed.
Lin et al. [24] studied the structure of Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts with various Mo loading by means of XRD,
IR, UV diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy, TPR and NH3
uptake measurements. They found that both the BET
surface areas and acidity of the catalysts decreased
with an increase in Mo loading. The threshold of the
monolayer dispersion is about 5 g of Mo per 100 g of
HZSM-5 zeolite. The effect of Mo loading on the acid-
ity of HZSM-5 zeolite was studied by measuring the
NH3 uptake at 573 K. The results showed that with the
introduction of Mo into HZSM-5 zeolite, the number
of acid sites decreased, and the extent of the elimina-
tion of strong acid sites increased with an increase in
Mo loading.
Lunsford et al. [32,34] reported by using FT-IR
technique that the intensities of three stretching bands
at 3747, 3611 and 3670 cm−1diminished after intro-
ducing Mo species onto HZSM-5. The relative de-
crease was markedly different for various OH species.
The weak band at 3670 cm−1 almost disappeared. The
concentration of OH groups associated with terminal
silanol species at 3747 cm−1 decreased to a signiﬁ-
cantly greater extent than that of the Bronsted acid OH
groups at 3611 cm−1 located inside the zeolite chan-
nels. For their 2Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, the intensity of
silanol OH band decreased to about 30%, while the in-
tensity of Bronsted OH groups hanged to about 70%.
According to the opinion of the authors, this is an in-
dication that the impregnated Mo species are located
in the vicinity of the hydroxyl groups.
Solymosi et al. [27–30] and Lunsford et al. [31,32]
conducted
XPS,
ion-scattering
spectroscopy
and
FT-IR measurements on the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst.
The Mo species in a sample calcined at 403 K were
mainly presented as small (30–50 Å) crystallites of
the original ammonium heptamolybdate impregnated
salt on the external surface of the zeolite. After cal-
cination at higher temperature (773 –973 K), the Mo
species became highly dispersed, but not uniformly
distributed on the external surface. During preparation
and/or pre-treatment, a portion of the Mo ions diffused
into the channels. The presence of moisture during
calcination might signiﬁcantly promote this diffusion,
especially at higher temperatures. In addition to the
fact that a small part of the Si was covered with Mo,
it appeared that silanol groups on the HZSM-5 were
replaced by Mo species on the external surface. Simi-
larly, Mo species inside the channels might react with
the Al (both in framework Al and extra framework
Al), and the extraction of framework Al could occur.
Recently, Howe et al. [48] reported their characteri-
zation studies of Mo-HZSM-5 catalysts by comparing
Mo-HZSM-5 as prepared, calcined at 773 K and/or
973 K and after reaction (used 1 h at 973 K), mainly
using FT-IR, 27Al and 29Si NMR and Mo K-edge
EXAFS techniques. By comparing the infrared spectra
in the n(OH) region direct evidence is obtained for pen-
etration of Mo species into the zeolite pores. Impreg-
nating their HZSM-5 sample with ammonium hepta-
molybdate caused some attenuation of the 3740 cm−1
band, conﬁrming the location of the initially adsorbed
molybdenum on the external surface of the zeolite.
Calcination above 773 K caused an attenuation of all
three hydroxyl bands of 3740, 3654 and 3610 cm−1.
However, after calcination at 973 K the hydroxyl
group concentrations were less than 10% of their ini-
tial values. Extensive dehydroxylation could not be
observed when HZSM-5 zeolites were calcined under
similar conditions. EXAFS measurements at the Mo
60
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
K-edge also revealed that the Fourier transforms of the
EXAFS from the three samples were completely dif-
ferent from each other. The authors also pointed out
that the structural parameters deduced from the EX-
AFS ﬁtting were similar but not identical to those
of bulk β-Mo2C, they may be ascribed to the highly
dispersed molybdenum carbide phase within the zeo-
lite pores in the Mo-HZSM-5 catalyst after reaction.
Howe et al. suggested that it is necessary for further
improvement of catalyst preparation to achieve max-
imum dispersion of the active Mo species within the
zeolite pores, and to optimize the acidity which is
closely related to the dispersion of the Mo species
and coke formation.
From the results mentioned above, it appears that
there is a remarkable interaction between Mo species
and the HZSM-5 zeolite, causing the Mo species to
be well-dispersed on/in the zeolite. This kind of in-
teraction increases with increasing Mo loading and/or
calcination temperature. When Mo loading and/or cal-
cination temperature is too high, the Mo species may
extract the framework Al to form extra framework Al
ﬁrst and then Al2(MoO4)3 crystallite [46].
In addition, most of the researchers supposed that
the introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of
the second metal component changed the acid sites
of the zeolite, decreasing the amount of strong acid
sites and increasing that of moderate strength acid sites
[24,36–38]. Xu et al. [40] explored the promotional ef-
fect of Ru on the titled reaction over Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alyst. NH3-TPD showed that the addition of Ru onto
Mo/HZSM-5 caused a further decrease in the amount
of strong acid sites, and at the same time, new acid
sites with moderate acid strength were created. TPR
and DTA analyses illustrated that the existence of Ru
with a proper dispersion promoted the reduction of
the Mo species and the splitting of the C–H bond of
methane. This modiﬁcation would suppress the coke
formation and hence enhance the reactivity and/or sta-
bility of the catalyst.
4. Active sites (or active phases) and reaction
mechanisms
The mode of methane activation continues to be
the focus of debate in the literature and many kinds
of active sites and reaction mechanisms have been
proposed. The following lists the main points of view.
(a) Xu et al. [19,25,40,49] suggested that the inter-
mediate of the reaction was ethylene, which further
polymerized to form benzene.
In their ﬁrst publication [19], Wang et al. sug-
gested that the activation of methane over HZSM-5
and Mo/HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts was initiated via
the carbenium ion mechanism, with Mo6+ species
or protonic sites acting as hydride acceptor:
CH4 + Mo6+ →CH+
3 + [Mo–H]5+
CH4 + H+(s) →CH+
3 (s) + H2
Based on their study, Xu et al. [25] proposed a pos-
sible mechanism in which both the heterolytic split-
ting of methane in a solid acid environment and a
molybdenum carbene-like complex as an interme-
diate were of signiﬁcance:
1. One of the C–H bonds in methane is polarized
via its interaction with the MoO3 species in the
channel of HZSM-5 zeolite:
(1)
2. The polarized molecule of methane reacts with
the Bronsted acid sites of HZSM-5, thereby
forming a catalytic cycle of the Bronsted acid
sites and the formation of carbene intermedi-
ate:
(2)
(3)
3. A transformation of molybdenum carbene-like
species via dimerization occurs to produce
ethylene as primary product.
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
61
Xu et al. [40] found that Mo6+ species were
partially reduced during the induction period. So
they changed the above mentioned active sites to
MoO(3−x), namely partially reduced Mo species.
Using XPS, Xu et al. [49] characterized the
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst after various treatments. It
was shown that Mo ions in the fresh catalyst were
mainly in the 6+ valence. During methane con-
version, reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+ and Mo4+
occurred. So, they gave the following mechanism.
1. The ﬁrst step of methane conversion involved
heterolytic dissociation of the C–H bond:
MoVI(=O)3 + Hδ––Cδ+–H3 →MoVI(=O)3
+ H−+ CH+
3
(4)
2. The formation of ethylene involved Mo active
sites in either 4+ or 5+ oxidation state.
2H−+ MoVI(=O)3→MoIV(=O)(–O−)2 + H2
(5)
MoIV(=O)(–O–)2 + CH+
3 →MoIV(=O)(–O−)
(–OH)(=CH2)
(6)
MoIV(=O)(–O−)(–OH)(=CH2) + CH+
3
→MoV(=O)2(–OH)(–C2H5)
(7)
MoV(=O)2(–OH)(–C2H5) →MoIV(=O)
(–OH)2 + C2H4
(8)
Recently, Wang et al. [38] also noticed that there
was an induction period before the initial formation
of benzene. It was suggested that a Mo phase trans-
formation took place at the ﬁrst step of methane
reaction on the catalyst and the new Mo phase pos-
sibly was molybdenum carbide (Mooch). So they
further gave the following mechanism:
CH4 →C + 2H2
(9)
MoO3 + H2 →MoO2 + H2O
(10)
MoO3 + C →MoC + CO + CO2
(11)
MoO2 + 3C →MoC + 2CO
(12)
It was on this active phase that methane non-oxidative
transformation to higher hydrocarbons occurred.
(b) Lin et al. [24] proposed that methane conversion
was catalyzed by the molybdenum species inside
the HZSM-5 channels together with the strong acid
sites of the zeolite. This process would form CH3•
free radicals, which could dimerize to form ethane
and ethylene easily. Then ethylene aromatized to
benzene with the aid of the protons of HZSM-5
zeolite. This could be schematically described as
follows:
CH4
MoOx
→
H+ CH3• + H•
(13)
2CH3•MoOx
→C2H4 + H2
(14)
3C2H4
H+
→C6H6 + 3H2
(15)
(c) Lunsford et al. characterized Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alyst by means of XPS technique and found that
during the initial induction period, CH4 reduced the
original Mo6+ ions in the zeolite to Mo2C accom-
panied by carbonaceous deposits [31,32]. Possibly
the Mo2C species are highly dispersed on the outer
surface and the partially reduced Mo species are lo-
cated in the channels of the zeolite. Activation of the
CH4 reactant then initiates on these Mo-containing,
probably carbide sites, to produce ethylene as the
sole primary product. Then the secondary reaction
leading to aromatics and other higher hydrocarbons
occurred entirely on acid sites without the assis-
tance of the molybdenum species. Later, they found
that pre-formation of Mo2C on the HZSM-5 sup-
port, without coke deposit, could not completely
eliminate the induction period. So they believed that
the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive to
form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, a coke mod-
iﬁed Mo2C surface might be the active species in
the formation of ethylene [32].
(d) Solymosi et al. [27,28] tested a MoO3/Sioux cat-
alyst and concluded that in the ﬁrst stage of the
reaction the reduction of MoO3 proceeded to give
CO (CO2) and H2O, which could be described as
follows:
MoO3 + CH4 = CO + 2H2O + 3MoO2
(16)
4MoO3 + CH4 = CO2 + 2H2O + 4MoO2
(17)
These reactions are followed by dehydrogenation of
CH4 on partially reduced catalyst, which could be an
oxidative dehydrogenation process,
62
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
CH4 + O(s) = CH3 + OH(s)
(18)
2OH(s) = H2O + O(s)
(19)
or a gradual decomposition of CH4,
2CH3 = C2H6
(20)
2CH2 = C2H4
(21)
C2H4 + CH3 = C3H7
(22)
C3H7 + H = C3H8
(23)
They believed that the key intermediate in the for-
mation of benzene was ethane, which was dehydro-
genated to ethylene on the catalyst surface.
Later, they investigated K2MoO4/HZSM-5 catalyst
and proposed a similar mechanism. But they specu-
lated that the coupling of CH2 species was the main
reaction pathway in the ethylene production. By us-
ing XPS technique, they found Mo2C was formed on
the used catalyst and regarded this as the active sites.
They further examined the catalytic performance of
unsupported and supported Mo2C [29,30] and con-
cluded that, besides Mo2C, the presence of some other
Mo compounds, perhaps the oxygen deﬁcient MoO2,
was also necessary for the activation of methane and
for the promotion of the formation of ethylene from
CHx fragments.
Mirodatos et al. [50,51] carried out a series of tran-
sient kinetic experiments, hydrogen tracing SSITKA
experiments and carbon tracing SSITKA experiments
on the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst, intending to understand
the nature of methane activation. They suggested that
several types of sites could be involved in the aromati-
zation process. The acid sites of the HZSM-5 support
may promote heterolytic methane activation, which
occurs in the presence of Mo carbide and/or partially
reduced Mo species and the acid sites within the ze-
olite matrix to allow ethylene to be polymerized into
benzene. In addition, Mo species, either on/in exter-
nal and/or internal surface may be responsible for
the methane dimerization coupling into ethylene. The
main steps of the process could be outlined as follows:
2CH4
Mo2C/MoOx
→
2H2 + C2H4
(24)
3C2H4
H+
→C6H6 + 3H2
(25)
Pierella et al. [44] investigated the conversion of pure
methane and natural gas with different purity to aro-
matic hydrocarbons. They supposed that pure methane
was transformed to aromatics over Mo-containing
HZSM-5 catalyst in the following schemes:
CH4 + Mo/HZSM-5 →CH+
3 + [Mo–H]5+
(26)
CH+
3 + Mo/HZSM-5 →Mo=CH2
(27)
Mo=CH2 + CH4 →C2H6 →aromatics
(28)
Mo=CH2 + Mo=CH2 →C2H4 →aromatics
(29)
Mo=CH2 →coke
(30)
CH4 + coke + Mo/HZS →aromatics
(31)
As for natural gas containing some hydrocarbons, the
main reaction mechanism could be as follows:
C+
2 hydrocarbons + Mo/HZSM-5
→C+
2 carbenium ions
(32)
CH4 + C+
2 carbenium ions →aromatics
(33)
C+
2 carbenium ions →coke
(34)
CH4 + coke →aromatics
(35)
Choudhary et al. [45] investigated methane activa-
tion at low temperatures in the presence of alkenes
or higher alkanes. They thought that methane activa-
tion resulted from its hydrogen-transfer reaction with
alkenes, and involved the following elementary reac-
tion steps:
CnH2n + H+ →(CnH2n+1)+
(36)
(37)
(38)
CH+
3 →CH2 + H+
(39)
2CH2 →C2H4
(40)
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
63
Ichikawa et al. demonstrated by using EXAFS (Mo
K-edge) and TG/DTA/Mass techniques that Mo ox-
ide on HZSM-5 was converted by CH4 at 923 K,
with the evolution of H2 and CO in addition to the
Mo carbide cluster [52]. The methane aromatization
reaction initiated to form C6H6, C10H8 and C2H4 in
evolving H2 above 923 K. These results indicated that
Mo carbide on HZSM-5 is an active species for the
catalytic methane aromatization. The authors stud-
ied in more detail the catalytic performances of the
hybrid catalysts of Mo2C or MoO3/Sioux + HZSM-5
in the methane aromatization at 1 atm and 973 K.
The speciﬁc rates of benzene formation expressed in
nmol/Mo/sec, as listed in the parentheses, are in the
following order:
3Mo/HZSM-(3162) > [MoO3 + HZSM-5](2019)
> MoO3/Sioux(412) > [Mo2C + HZSM-5](150)
> Mo2C(3) > HZSM-5(0.6)
The authors claimed that these imply bi-functional
catalysis for methane aromatization proceeded at the
interface of Mo carbide and ZSM-5 support. Thus,
Ichikawa et al. suggested that methane is activated
on Mo carbide sites to form CHx and C2-species
which may migrate at the interface of the ZSM-5
acidic support, followed by dehydro-aromatization of
C2-intermediates to benzene and naphthalene.
From the above-mentioned mechanisms suggested
by different research groups, we can see that all the
above mechanisms, particularly the elementary reac-
tion pathways, are speculative. Direct experimental ev-
idence for these mechanisms is currently unavailable.
Anyway, some spectroscopic studies at lower temper-
ature (less than 200 K) may give us some clues. Lin et
al. reported their comparative FT-IR study on the in-
teraction of methane with the surface of silica, alumna
and HZSM-5 zeolite at low temperature at ﬁrst, and
then at higher temperature [53,54]. It was found that
at the low temperature of 173 K the infrared inactive
mode (2917 cm−1) of free methane became active and
shifted to lower frequencies, when methane was ad-
sorbed on the zeolite sample. The authors claimed that
the weakening of the C–H bond of methane due to
the distortion of the methane molecule resulted from
its interaction with the zeolite surface and is possi-
bly the ﬁrst step in methane activation. The authors
assigned the bands at 3002 and 2890 cm−1 to the ad-
sorbed methane that interacts with the bridged hy-
droxyl groups, whereas the band at 2900 cm−1 results
from the adsorbed methane that interacts with the oxy-
gen anion species of the HZSM-5 zeolite. Surprisingly
the authors found in their FT-IR study that the in-
troduction of Mo species into HZSM-5 considerably
attenuates the adsorption of methane. It has been ob-
served that the hydroxyl groups of silica, g-alumina
and HZSM-5 could exchange with CD4 at tempera-
tures higher than 773 K. On the other hand, in their lat-
est work Solymosi et al. [55] investigated the reaction
pathways of adsorbed CH3 on the Mo2C/Mo(1 1 1)
surface by using TPD, XPS and HREELS. The ad-
sorbed CH3 resulted from CH3I adsorption on Mo2C
at 90 K and dissociates near 140 K. The main prod-
uct is H2, CH4 and C2H4. It was concluded that the
adsorbed CH3 dehydrogenates to CH2, a fraction of
which dimerizes into ethylene.
5. The nature of the carbonaceous deposit and its
role in the reaction
The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed during the
methane dehydro-aromatization is a major obstacle for
a better understanding of the reaction and for pro-
cess development. Lunsford et al. [56] characterized
the surface carbon formed during the conversion of
methane to benzene over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts by us-
ing XPS. They identiﬁed three different types of sur-
face carbon species on an active Mo/HZSM-5 cata-
lyst. The authors denoted them as species A, B, and
C. Species A, characterized by a C1s bonding energy
(BE) of 284.6 eV, was due to graphitic-like carbon
and was mainly present in the zeolite channel sys-
tem. Species B, with a C1s BE of 282.7 eV was due
to carbidic-like carbon in Mo2C and mainly located
at the outer surface of the zeolite. Species C, with a
C1s BE of 283.2 eV is a hydrogen-poor sp type or
pre-Graphtec type of carbon. The species C is also
mainly present on the outer surface of the zeolite, and
its amount increases with increasing time on stream.
According to the authors’ opinion, the sp-type carbon
gradually covers both the zeolite surface and the Mo2C
phase during methane activation and is responsible for
the deactivation of Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst during the
methane dehydro-aromatization.
64
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
Xu et al. studied the carbonaceous deposit of
Mo/HZSM-5 after reaction by NMR [57]. They
showed that there are two kinds of carbonaceous de-
posits, one is located on acid sites and the other is
on partially reduced Mo species. The former leads
to a decrease in the amount of acid sites, which are
available and necessary for initially formed ethylene
transformation into aromatics and naphthalene. The
latter may be responsible for methane activation and
effectively transform from carbene-like species and/or
carbide species to ethylene [57].
The suppression of carbonaceous deposit formed
during the methane aromatization is a topic intensively
studied in many research groups, but few results have
been published. Recently Ichikawa et al. reported that
increasing methane pressure and the addition of CO
and CO2 to the methane feed enhanced catalyst sta-
bility for the reaction [52,58]. They found that the
formation rates of benzene and hydrocarbons increase
moderately by increasing methane pressure although
the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable under
pressurized condition. This kind of pressure relation
may be connected with a sufﬁcient supply of H2 from
methane as well as a suitable concentration of the sur-
face carbon species CHx for the formation of aromat-
ics products. Furthermore, the authors claimed that the
addition of CO and CO2 to the methane feed led to
a remarkable increase in catalyst stability. The ben-
zene formation rates were higher than 100 nmol/g cat h
even after 100 h on the Co-Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst in
the reaction of CH4 + 3.5% CO, while the activity
decreased greatly to less than 10 nmol/g cat h, using
pure methane as feed under the same reaction con-
ditions [48,54]. By using 13Co and CH4 mixture as
the feed to conduct the reaction Ichikawa et al. sug-
gested a mechanism to explain the unique role of CO
in methane aromatization reaction in stabilizing the
catalyst performance and promoting benzene forma-
tion. First, CO dissociates on Mo sites to form the
active carbon species CHx and C2 species through re-
action (42) and (43). Second, it is followed with their
oligomerization to form higher hydrocarbons such as
benzene and naphthalene in reaction (41) on the cat-
alyst. Third, the dissociated oxygen species [O] from
CO may react with the surface inert carbon species
(coke) to regenerate CO, resulting in the suppression
of the coke formation on the catalyst through reaction
(44).

6. Concluding remarks
Methane dehydro-aromatization in a ﬂow reactor
over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst system under non-oxidative
condition has received much attention since it was
ﬁrst reported in 1993. Due to the unique features of
this reaction great advances have been achieved since
then. During the last 6 years, several important points
were well established. The key point is that several
research groups investigated the reaction by using N2
or Ar as an internal standard, making it possible to ac-
count on-line for the carbonaceous deposit on the cat-
alyst surface. Lin et al. conﬁrmed the reliability of this
method by the material balance test of the titled reac-
tion operated on a 20 ml bench scale reactor [33]. The
reaction conditions used by several research groups
were quite similar, and therefore, allowed the exper-
imental results to be compared with each other. Till
date, to prepare the best catalyst, two components, Mo
species and HZSM-5 are necessary, though not nec-
essarily sufﬁcient. Nevertheless it is recognized that
a simple process of catalyst preparation accepted by
various groups is to impregnate HZSM-5 zeolite with
ammonium heptamolybdate at room temperature, to
keep the Mo loading in the range of 2–6%, and then
calcine the sample at 773 K for several hours. In the
case of introducing a second metal component, among
the many possible choices, one should impregnate the
Mo species ﬁrst. This is one piece of evidence that
shows the importance of the interaction between the
Mo species and the HZSM-5 zeolite to the titled re-
action. A remarkable interactions has been detected
between the Mo component and the support, which is
Y. Xu, L. Lin / Applied Catalysis A: General 188 (1999) 53–67
65
necessary for the high dispersal of Mo species on the
support. The interactions also play important roles in
the preparation of a good catalyst. Generally speaking,
the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and
the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the
zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance.
The induction period of the reaction is commonly rec-
ognized, in which Mo6+ species possibly located on
the external surface of the support are partially re-
duced or reduced to Mo2C, mainly yielding H2O, CO,
CO2 and H2. After the induction period, CO, light
hydrocarbons (such as ethylene and ethane etc.), ben-
zene, toluene, and naphthalene etc. are formed. On
the other hand, part of the Bronsted acid sites kept
free on the HZSM-5 surface are necessary for the
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. Now it is generally accepted
that the Mo/HZSM-5 is a kind of bi-functional cata-
lyst. Although there are arguments about the reaction
mechanism, it is generally accepted that ethylene is
the intermediate of the reaction, which is transformed
to benzene, further condensation converts benzene to
napthalene and higher aromatic and carbonaceous de-
posit.
Many problems still remain to be solved about this
reaction, not only from the point of view of academic
research, but also from the point of view of potential
industrial utilization of natural gas. The key points for
future research on the reaction are as follows:
6.1. The nature of carbonaceous deposits and their
role in the reaction
As we have already pointed out, carbonaceous mate-
rials deposit during the methane dehydro-aromatization.
This is the main obstacle for better understanding of
the reaction and for the development of the process.
Unfortunately, this topic has not received enough
attention to illustrate the mechanism and nature of
carbonaceous formation in this area. Therefore, char-
acterization of the carbonaceous materials deposited
during the different stages of the reaction by means of
a temperature-programmed technique equipped with
mass spectrometer and other physical and chemical
techniques is of signiﬁcance in order to understand
their nature and roles. On the basis of a deeper sci-
entiﬁc understanding of the carbonaceous deposits,
some practical ways may be found to diminish the
formation of the carbonaceous deposits, which is
detrimental for the reaction. Currently, some im-
provement has been achieved in our laboratory for the
preparation of catalysts with high selectivity for ben-
zene and low selectivity for carbonaceous deposits.
The interpretation of these results is pending.
6.2. The location and distribution of Mo species
Mo species exhibit their unique properties for
methane dehydro-aromatization over the Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts. Several results showed that most of the
Mo located on the external surface of the zeolite af-
ter impregnation of ammonium heptamolybdate with
HZM-5. An unavoidable trend is that the Mo species
located on the external surface will migrate into the
channels of the zeolite during the process of calcina-
tion. The question of how to control a proper ratio of
Mo species on the external and internal surfaces of
HZSM-5 and increase their stability via chemical and
physical approaches is still open.
6.3. Reaction mechanism
It is well accepted that both the metal and the acid
sites of a bi-functional catalyst play a crucial role
in methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts in the absence of oxygen, despite the fact
that various active sites and reaction mechanisms were
suggested by different research groups. Even so, a pic-
ture of the bi-functional catalysis over Mo/HZSM-5 is
emerging. Is it a kind of remote control or a concerted
one at the interface of Mo species on the active sites
involving Mo species and acid sites of the HZSM-5
support? Such a question is also under discussion in
the ﬁeld of short chain alkane aromatization over Zn
or Ga modiﬁed HZSM-5 catalysts, which has been
much more extensively studied in heterogeneous catal-
ysis. Furthermore, since there are quite a lot of simi-
larities between short chain alkane aromatization and
methane aromatization, we may reasonably consider
methane aromatization as an extension of short chain
alkane aromatization. Therefore we may apply knowl-
edge of short chain alkane aromatization to methane
aromatization to determine what is common in both
aromatization reactions, and which aspects are unique
for methane aromatization.

6.4. Methane activation and active sites (or active
phase)
Methane activation and conversion is a great chal-
lenge as well as a long-term subject in catalysis
science. Great effort has been devoted to the subject
using either homogeneous or heterogeneous cataly-
sis. We note that acidity and heterolytic splitting of
methane are both important factors in activation of
methane in homogeneous catalysis. Meanwhile, ba-
sicity and homolytic splitting play key roles in the
activation of methane in heterogeneous catalysis. Now
it seems that these remarkable differences between
methane activation in homogeneous and heteroge-
neous catalysis are less pronounced with methane
dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts.
The HZSM-5 zeolite, an acid solution-like environ-
ment in solid state, is also available for methane acti-
vation under the assistance of TMI. The acid strength
of HZSM-5 zeolite, according to Lunsford group’s
measurement by solid state NMR recently [59], is not
in the range of an ultra-strong acid. Does this imply
that an acid solution-like environment in solid state
under the assistance of TMI is more available for
methane activation?
Several research groups have indicated that Mo2C
and/or partially reduced Mo species are the active sites
responsible for methane activation. The real status of
the Mo species during the reaction and the role of
the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental
reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization
over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general signiﬁcance
for methane chemistry and for the development of the
theory of methane activation.
