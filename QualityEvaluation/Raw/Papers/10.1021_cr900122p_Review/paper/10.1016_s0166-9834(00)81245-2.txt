ABSTRACT 
The oxidation of n-butane and of its intermediates 
to maleic anhydride has been 
studied on different vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides and on Ti02- and zeolites-supported 
vanadium oxides. On vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides the activity in n-butane selective 
oxidation depends strongly on the catalyst microstructure. 
On supported vanadium 
oxides n-butane is not selectively 
oxidized ; however, when the amount of vanadium 
deposed largely exceeds the monolayer amount, low yields of acetic acid are obtained. 
The analysis of the oxidation of some intermediates 
suggests that the mechanism of 
maleic anhydride formation from n-butane occurs through the successive formation of 
butadiene, 2,5-dihydrofuran 
and furan via successive cycles of oxygen insertion and 
allylic H-abstraction 
and that these properties are connected to the vanadium ions 
and not to a particular surface structure. On the contrary, the alkane activation 
requires a particular surface structure of vanadium deriving by straining of V-(OP) 
connections. 
A model of the possible mechanism for n-butane activation 
iS also given. 
INTRODUCTION 
Notwistanding 
the growing interest in the selective oxidation of n-butane to mal- 
eic anhydride 
(11, 
the 
nature of the active sites able to activate the paraffins is 
not clear and the only hypothesis made in the literature, 
involving the Presence Of 
D- species (21, is lacking the experimental 
support necessary in order to extraPol_ 
ate the results to real catalysts. Furthermore, 
due to the very complex and.multi- 
steps 
reaction 
pattern, 
lacking 
knowledges 
are 
present 
in 
literature 
on 
the 
nature 
and 
structure 
of 
the 
active 
sites 
necessary for the successive steps from n-butane 
to maleic anhydride. 
Aim of this work was to analyze our data of the selective oxidation of n-butane 
and of its possible intermediates 
to maleic anhydride on different vanadium-based 
catalysts, for the Purpose of determining 
the reaction mechanism 
and the nature and

EXPERIMENTAL 
Vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides (VP): V205 was reduced in 37 % HCl, then o-H3P04 added 
to obtain a P:V atomic ratio of 1.0. The resulting solution was concentrated 
and 
then 
water 
added 
to 
obtain 
a 
blue precipitate which was dried at 150 C for 24 h 
(VP a*). 
~205 was reduced in a mixture (3:2) of isobuthyllbenzyl 
alcohols, then 
o-H3P04 added to obtain a P:V atomic ratio of 1.0. 
The resulting slurry was filtered 
and dried at 150 C for 24 h (VP b*). 
Both precursor samples VP(a*) and VP(b*) were 
then activated in a flow of 1% n-butane/air 
at 400 C for 6 h, to give the VP(a) and 
VP(b) catalysts, 
respectively. 
Vanadium-supported 
oxides : 
VT1 18 and VTi 117 catalysts were prepared by impregnat- 
ion with a NH4V03/oxalic 
acid/water solution, drying at 150 C for 24 h and calcinat- 
ion at 430 C for 3 h. Both Ti02 supports in the anatase form were Tioxide, CLDD 1587/ 
/2 (18.4 m2/g) and CLDD 1764/Z (117 m*/g) respectively. 
The amount of vanadium depos- 
ited in both cases was 10% wt of V205. 
Zeolites-supported 
vanadium oxides (VZ) were prepared by impregnation 
with a 
NH4V03 solution of Y-zeolite [ VZ(HY) 1, HZSM-5 or HZSM-11 [ VZ(ZSM5) and VZ(ZSM11) j 
and by ionic exchange with VOS04 solution of Y-zeolite [ V02+ Y ]. Amount of deposed 
vanadium is about 2 % wt of V205 and 3.5% wt in the case of V02+Y . Before catalytic 
tests, 
samples were activated in air at 430 C for 6 h. 
Further details on the preparation 
of all these catalysts and on their characte- 
rization 
have 
been 
reported 
previously 
(j-10). 
Catalytic 
tests 
Catalytic 
tests 
were 
performed 
in a flow reactor with analysis on-line of the 
reagent composition 
and products of reaction by means of two gas-chromatographs. 
Details of the reactor and method of analysis are reported elsewhere 
(8). One g of 
catalyst was used for each test. The reagent composition 
was hydrocarbon:oxygen:ni- 
trogen 0.6:12.0:87. 
The total flow of the reactant was 70 cc/min. 
RESULTS 
Vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides 
The catalytic behaviors of VP(a) and VP(b) catalysts in n-butane and 1-butene 
selective oxidation are reported in Figure 1. Catalyst VP(b) is more active than 
catalyst VP(a) both in alkene and alkane oxidation, in agreement with the higher 
surface area (27 and 6 m2/g, respectively). 
However the difference 
in activity is 
much greater in the n-butane than in 1-butene oxidation. Furthermore, 
whereas the

the specific rate per m 
of surface area of 1-butene depletion is quite similar for 
the two catalysts, the specific rate in n-butane depletion is about 6 times higher. 
This 
indicates 
that 
the 
number 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
active 
sites 
on 
the 
two catalysts 
are similar for the olefin selective oxidation, whereas on catalyst VP(a) a smaller 
number of centers able to activate the paraffin, slow step in the general mechanism 
from n-butane to maleic anhydride 
(8,9), are present. 
The behaviors of the most active 
VP(b) catalyst in the oxidation of butadiene, 
2,5-dihydrofuran 
and furan are reported in Figure 2. In the oxidation of butadiene, 
furan is obtained as principal product at low conversion ; increasing the conversion, 
the furan yield decreases and increases the formation of maleic anhydride. The oxid- 
ation of 2,5-dihydrofuran 
starts at very low temperatures 
and it is very selective 
in furan formation 
(>90%) 
; at higher temperatures 
the formed furan is overoxicized 
to maleic anhydride and carbon oxides. The oxidation of furan occurs in the same 
range of temperatures 
as for butadiene, giving maleic anhydride as principal selecti- 
ve product ; the selectivity 
in maleic anhydride is 
from butadiene. 
Vanadium-supported 
catalysts 
Reported in Figure 3 are the catalytic behaviors 
only slightly higher of that 
in n-butane oxidation of VTi 18 
and VT1 117 catalysts, with the same amount of vanadium deposited, 
but with different 
surface areas of the support. The VT1 18 catalyst with the lower surface area is 
more active in n-butane oxidation giving only acetic acid. The VTi 117 catalyst 
(higher surface area) is less active and only carbon oxides are formed.

Zeolites-supported 
vanadium oxides (Fig. 3) are active in n-butane oxidation only 
at high temperatures, 
giving carbon oxides as the only products. 
Table I shows some results of the oxidation of 1-butene and butadiene on Ti02- 
and zeolites-supported 
vanadium oxides. All catalysts are selective at low conver- 
sion in furan formation, whereas only carbon oxides are formed at high conversion. 
On TiOB- supported vanadium oxides both furan and maleic anhydride were formed. No 
significant differences were found between the I-butene and butadiene oxidation.

DISCUSSION 
Nature of active sites for alkane activation 
------ 
Catalytic data (Fig. 
n-butane 
activation 
are 
1) indicate 
that a higher 
amount 
of specific 
centers 
for 
present 
in catalyst 
VP(b), 
X-ray 
diffraction 
analysis, 
howev- 
et-, 
indicates 
that 
only 
the same (VO)2P207 
phase is present 
in both catalysts (41, 
leading 
to the 
question 
: why does the same 
cry,stalline 
phase, 
prepared 
in different 
irays, posses 
different specificity in the selective 
attack 
of the alkane. 
The (vO),P,07 forms by dehydration 
of the VOHP04.$H20 
precursor phase (11-12). 
The structure of VOHP04.$H20 
is formed by (VOHP04), 
sheets held together by hydro- 
gen bonding between the coordinated 
water molecules and the P-OH groups of adjacent 
layers. Three differences 
have been pointed out (4,13) between the precursor phases 
A (voHPD~.$H~O) 
of the VP(a) and VP(b) catalysts [ VPa* and VPb*, 
respectively 
1. 
VP(b*j in 
constrast to VP(a*), has (i) a lamellar morphology, 
as shown by SEM micro- 
graphs, (ii) disorder in the stacking-fold, 
as shown 
by XRD analysis, 
and (iii) 
the 
presence of organic alcohol utilized during the preparation which remains trapped 
between the layers, as shown by FT-IR and 
76 analyses 
. 
The transformation 
2 VOHP04.$H20 
---+(VO)2P207 
+ 2 H20 
is a topotactic reaction (11,12) occurring without a break in the V-O-P connections. 
For this reason also in the VP(b) catalyst, in contrast to the VP(a) catalyst, there 
is (i) disorder in the stacking-fold 
and (ii) a lamellar morphology which causes 
preferential 
exposure of the (020) plane on the surface (4,13). Disorder in the 
stacking-fold 
of the (020) planes also modifies the surface properties. 
In fact, the 
adsorption 
of the very-weak 
base acetonitrile 
followed 
by FT-IR spectroscopy 
(14,15), 
indicates two characteristics 
of the (VO),P,O7 samples : (i) the presence 
of medium- 
-strong and of very-strong 
Lewis sites 
and (ii) a prevalent presence of very-strong 
Lewis sites on the VP(b) surface and of medium-strong 
Lewis sites on the VP(a) 
surface. 
The (020) plane is exposed predominantly 
on the (V012P207 surface (13) ; in this 
plane, coupled vanadyl ions are present in trims 
POSitiOnS 
: 
SCHEME 1 
Taking into 
account the higher electronegativity 
of phosphorus which polarizes the 
V -+(0-P) bond, the presence of medium-strong 
Lewis acidity due to Va atoms can be 
thus explained in the catalyst VP(a) surface. However the enhanced Lewis acidity of 
the catalyst VP(b) surface cannot be explained. The (020) planes are connected by 
pyrophosphate 
groups and thus disorder in the stacking-fold 
of the (020) planes 
induces the straining of the 
V~lr~~(O-Pl 
bonds, which can be schematically 
represen- 
ted as follows : 
A 
SCHEME 2 
The Lewis acidity of the Vb atoms is enhanced by this effect as compared to the 
Lewis acidity of the corresponding 
Va atoms. 
It has been shown on solid super acid (16) that the first step in the activation 
of n-butane is the extraction of an H- from the n-butane by very-strong 
Lewis sites. 
Similarly, it is possible to hypothesize that the very-strong 
Lewis sites observed 
on catalyst VP(b) and to a lesser extent on catalyst VP(a), are the sites responsi- 
ble for the first step in alkane activation on vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides. 
It is 
thus possible to propose the mechanism of n-butane selective activation showed in 
Scheme 3. A coordinated 
attack of itrong Lewis sites ( Vb atoms ) and of a strong 
base ( OS-) activates the n-butane, giving the corresponding 
olefins which are 
further quickly oxidized due to their higher reactivity.

In a previous work we have showed (9) 
that 
the general 
mechanism 
of maleic 
anhy- 
dride formation 
from n-butane 
can be written 
as follows :

SCHEME 3 Mechanism of selective activation of n-butane on vanadium-phosphorus 
oxides. 
Also, we have showed that it is possible to isolate these intermediates 
in particular 
conditions, 
if the successive oxidation is avoided (9). 
The butenes 4butadiene 
step is clearly an allylic oxidation, 
whereas it is 
more difficult to explain the butadiene 4furan 
step. However Fig. 2 shows that 
on catalyst VP(b) 
the 2,5-dihydrofuran 
4furan 
conversion 
occurs at very low tem- 
peratures and with very high selectivities, 
suggesting 
a further 
step between 
buta- 
diene and 
furan with the 2,5-dihydrofuran 
as the intermediate. 
This suggests that 
furan is formed by an oxygen insertion in l-4 position on the butadiene molecule to 
form the 2,5_dihydrofuran 
followed by a double H-allylic extraction 
to give furan 
(17). In a similar way it is possible to explain the maleic anhydride formation from 
furan (17), in agreement with the similar reactivity of butadiene and furan (Fig. 2). 
In conclusion, 
the whole mechanism from butenes to maleic anhydride can be 
explained on the basis of the two known mechanisms of (i) oxygen attack on double 
bond and (ii) H-allylic extraction. 
These two properties are characteristics 
of the 
vanadium ions itself and not of a special surface structure. 
In fact, vanadium 
oxide supported on different kinds of support (Table I), is always able to perform 
these types of reactions, as showed by the tests at low conversion, 
for which the 
reactions of successive oxidation to carbon oxides of the formed compounds are 
negligible. 
On the contrary, the n-butane activation to give butenes requires a special sur- 
face structure as indicated by the tests on the supported vanadium oxides (Fig. 3) 
272 
and on different catalysts VP . Correspondingly, 
the proposed model for the nature 
of the active centers for alkane activation requires a specific surface configurat- 
ion of vanadium 
ions 
and of V --(O-P) 
connections 
and the reactivity 
of the surface 
is tightly 
connected to the modality 
of preparation.
