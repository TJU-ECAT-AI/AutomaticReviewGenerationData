Recent computational studies of C–H bond activation at late transition metal systems are discussed and
processes where lone pair assistance via heteroatom co-ligands or carboxylates are highlighted as a
particularly promising means of cleaving C–H bonds. The term ‘ambiphilic metal ligand activation’
(AMLA) is introduced to describe such reactions.

Introduction
The activation and functionalisation of C–H bonds is one of the
most active ﬁelds of current chemical research.1,2 This work is
motivated by the desire to make more efﬁcient and effective use
of cheap and abundant simple hydrocarbons as feedstocks for
chemical synthesis. Central to this goal is the activation of the
C–H bond itself. Such bonds can certainly no longer be considered
‘inert’ and a number of successful catalytic schemes based on
intramolecular C–H bond activation have now been realised.3
Successful catalysis based on intermolecular functionalisation of
C–H bonds has also been demonstrated but progress in this area
remains a considerable challenge.4,5a A thorough understanding
of the means by which cleavage of a C–H bond can be achieved
remains a key consideration and computational modelling is set
to play a central role in providing insight into this process.
From the 1980s, experimental observations of intermolecular
C–H activation have been quickly followed by seminal insights
from computation and the state of play was summarised in

some key reviews in 2000.6 Over this period, improvements in
methodology, in particular the advent of density functional theory
(DFT),7 coupled with improvements in computer power, have
resulted in a dramatic expansion in both the range of systems that
can be studied and the nature of the problems that can be addressed
computationally. Above all, the ability of DFT to routinely deﬁne
the structures and energies of reactive intermediates and transition
states has been particularly important. Such information is, in
most cases, very difﬁcult to obtain from experiment. Increasingly,
therefore, computational studies are being performed in parallel
with experiment, bringing to bear a powerful synergy of com-
plementary techniques to the intricate problem of understanding
reaction mechanisms.
In
the
mid-1990s,
mechanisms
of
C–H
activation
by
organometallic complexes were generally considered to fall into
one of three general categories: (i) oxidative addition (OA)
at electron-rich low-valent transition metal centres (ii) s-bond
metathesis (SBM) at electrophilic early transition metal (and
lanthanide) centres and (iii) electrophilic activation (EA) at
electron-deﬁcient late transition metal centres. More recently,
the ability to categorise a C–H activation mechanism on the
basis of the anticipated behaviour of a given metal centre has
become increasingly problematic. One illustrative mechanistic
quandary arose with the low-temperature activation of alkanes at
[Cp*Ir(PMe3)(CH3)(OTf)].

be anticipated at Ir, but in this case it must be coupled to rapid
reductive elimination (RE) as no intermediate was observed.
Given the electron-deﬁcient nature of these cationic IrIII species
SBM was also considered a possibility (Fig. 1). Calculations
ultimately deﬁned an OA/RE pathway in these systems9,10 and
experimental support for this was subsequently gained from the
direct observation of IrIII/IrV C–H bond activation cycles.11 At
the same time, however, calculations on analogous Rh species
were consistent with a one step process where the transition state
takes on oxidative character normally associated with an OA
intermediate (centre, Fig. 1).12 Further examples of these one-step
‘oxidative’ reaction steps followed13 and now it is apparent that
SBM is possible at both early and late TM centres. In the following,
we shall use the term SBM as a general label for these processes,
although, as discussed below, several terms have been proposed
by different groups. A further particularly promising development
involves the design of well-deﬁned systems with heteroatom-based
groups to act as intramolecular H-acceptors. The widening array
of systems capable of C–H activation have sparked debate on the

mechanisms of this process, an issue computational chemistry is
ideally placed to address.
This perspective will discuss recent mechanistic insights into
C–H bond activation arising from computational studies. We will
only consider activations involving even electron processes where
the metal is directly involved and thus exclude other types of C–H
activation such as P450-based or radical processes.15 Three broad
systems, involving middle-late transition metals with dn (n ≥4),
will be considered: (i) SBM processes at LnM–R Bonds (R = C or
B) (ii) systems where a heteroatom-based group bearing lone pairs
acts as the H-acceptor (formal 1,2-addition) and (iii) “electrophilic
activation” of C–H bonds which involve carboxylate or carbonate
as base. In general no mention of the speciﬁc methodologies will
be given; unless otherwise stated results are based on DFT and
the original papers should be consulted for full details.

SBM reactions at LnM–R bonds (R = C or B)

SBM at LnM–R bonds (R = alkyl or aryl)
General aspects of this topic have been reviewed recently by Lin14
who has emphasized the role of occupied metal d-orbitals in stabi-
lizing the transferring hydrogen. As a result, computed transition
states often feature short M ◊◊◊H contacts that are consistent with
the presence of a M–H bond and Lin has called these ‘oxidatively-
added transition states’ (OATS). The nature of the metal centre can
therefore dramatically affect the C–H activation. In their study of
C(sp3)-H bond activation at {TpM(PH3)(CH3)} fragments (M =
Fe, Ru, Os; Tp = tris(pyrazolyl)borate) Lin, Lau and Eisenstein
showed computed activation barriers increase in the order Os <
Ru < Fe (see Fig. 2).16 Even more striking was the changing nature
of the C–H activation process. With M = Os ‘normal’ 3-centred
oxidative addition was characterised, but with the Ru and Fe
analogues 4-centred transition states were seen. For M = Ru a
very shallow RuIV–H intermediate was located, while for M = Fe
C–H activation was clearly a one-step process via a transition state
featuring a short Fe ◊◊◊H distance of only 1.53 A

fragments, inspired by the role these species play in cat-
alytic
alkene
hydroarylation
(see
below).
Typical
is
cis-
[Ir(acac¢)2(CH2CH2Ph)(C6H6)], 1, in which C–H activation occurs
via SBM (DG‡ = 14.1 kcal mol-1) with an Ir ◊◊◊H distance of
only 1.58 A
˚ in the transition state (see Scheme 1). This implies an
oxidation of the metal centre, prompting Goddard and Periana
to adopt the term ‘oxidative hydrogen migration’ (OHM) for this
type of process.17 Interestingly, Periana had previously speculated
that C–H activation in 1 might proceed via an OA pathway,18
by analogy to Bergman’s [Cp*Ir(PMe3)(CH3)(OTf)] system (see
Introduction). The fact that a SBM pathway is computed for 1 may
reﬂect an increase in steric crowding and a more electron deﬁcient
metal centre, both factors that mitigate against a 7-coordinate Ir(V)
intermediate. Certainly distinguishing between these possibilities
would have been difﬁcult without computational input.
Scheme 1
Further studies by Periana and Goddard suggest that barriers to
these SBM processes can be modulated by the ligand environment.
Thus replacing the acac¢ ligands in 1 with tropolonate reduces the
activation barrier by 2.3 kcal mol-1, a result thought to be related
to the more electron-releasing character of the latter.19 Similarly,
although a lower C–H activation barrier was computed for the
IrIII complex 1 compared to [TpRuII(CO)(CH2CH2Ph)(C6H6)]20
this trend was reversed by exchanging the ligand sets (i.e.
[RuII(acac¢)2(CO)(CH2CH2Ph)(C6H6)]- has a lower barrier than
[TpIrIII(CO)(CH2CH2Ph)(C6H6)]+).21 Predicting relative barriers
on the basis of metal oxidation state alone is therefore difﬁcult.
Further work on isoelectronic d6 analogues of these complexes
yielded a wide range of C–H activation barriers, the lowest being
only 0.7 kcal mol-1 for [OsII(acac¢)2(CO)(CH2CH2Ph)(C6H6)]-.
In this case, (as was seen for the [TpOs(PH3)(CH3)(CH4)]
system above), C–H activation actually proceeds by an OA
pathway.
A more complicated picture of co-ligand effects emerges from
work by Gunnoe and Cundari on [TpRu(L)(R)(C6H6)] species.
For R = CH3 a lower computed barrier to C–H activation
is found when L = PMe3 (DG‡ = 10.9 kcal mol-1) compared
to L = CO (DG‡ = 14.9 kcal mol-1). This is apparently consistent
with the ability of the more electron-releasing PMe3 ligand to
stabilize ‘oxidative character’ in the transition state.22,23 However,
steric effects can dominate in these systems in particular, the
combination of ligands present is important. Thus when L =
CO computed barriers are relatively insensitive to changes in
the accepting group, R (R = Ph: DG‡ = 15.5 kcal mol-1 R =
CH2CH2Ph: DG‡ = 13.5 kcal mol-1), but activation barriers
increase signiﬁcantly in the more sterically encumbered PMe3
analogues (R = Ph: DG‡ = 17.1 kcal mol-1; R = CH2CH2Ph:
DG‡ = 20.0 kcal mol-1).24
These results are all signiﬁcant in the context of catalytic alkene
hydroarylation, which has been demonstrated by both Periana18
and Gunnoe25 (Fig. 3). Currently, however, activities are still
too low for practical use and one major difﬁculty in improving
performance is the competitive C–H activation of ethene at the
2-phenylethyl intermediate, 2 (see Fig. 4). This releases ethyl-
benzene (the desired product) but stops catalysis through the
formation of a M-vinyl that subsequently inserts another molecule
of ethene to form stable h3-allyl species (3 in Fig. 4).26,27 The
much stronger binding of ethene results in increased barriers to

C–H activation. For example C–H activation in cis-[Ir(acac¢)2-
(CH2CH2Ph)(C2H4)] has a barrier of 30.3 kcal mol-1,17 17.4 kcal
mol-1 higher than that for the benzene analogue, but overall
the two C–H activation transition states are at very similar
energies (Fig. 4). Goddard has highlighted the potentially intrinsic
problems in the design of alkene hydroarylation catalysts of
this type, in that a more electron rich metal centre that is
thought to promote C–H activation would tend to retard the
prior alkene insertion step by forming a strongly-bound alkene
adduct.20,21 Ironically, although much attention is focused on the
C–H activation it is often the less glamorous components of a
catalytic cycle that hamper progress, for example the displacement
of ligands to create a vacant site for substrate activation or the
‘mundane’27 alkene insertion step.
Important insight into these SBM processes has been gained by
varying the nature of the substrate. Thus, computed barriers for
C–H activation in [(Tp)Ru(L)(Me)(p-C6H5X)] species, yield linear
Hammett plots with r = 2.6 (L = CO) and 2.3 (L = PMe3).23
Electron withdrawing para-substituents therefore stabilize the
C–H activation transition states, which is opposite to what is
expected for classical electrophilic aromatic substitution. These
RuII systems also appear more sensitive to substituent effects
than the classic Cp*2Sc-Me system studied by Bercaw.28 Ru ◊◊◊H
distances in these [(Tp)Ru(L)(Me)(p-C6H5X)] transition states
fall in the range 1.592 A
˚ to 1.677 A
˚ with the shortest bond
being computed with the most electron withdrawing substituents.
Even longer Ru ◊◊◊H distances of ca. 1.75 A
˚ had been calculated
in earlier studies of C–H activation of the 2-position of THF
and thiophene at {(Tab)Ru(CO)Me} (where Tab is the [HB{–
N=NH}3]- model ligand).29
In general, more acidic C–H bonds appear easier to activate.
Thus activation of a b-C–H bond in Et2O by {TpRu(PH3)(H)}
showed a reduced barrier compared to CH4 (relative in each
case to their respective s-adduct precursors).30 Recent work by
Gunnoe and Cundari supports this idea with computed C–H
activation barriers at a {TpRu(PH3)(CH3)} fragment follow-
ing the trend CH3NO2 < CH3CN < (CH3)2CO < THF <
c-C6H12. Moreover a less basic acceptor group (CH2CN in
place of CH3) increases the barrier. All these observations are
consistent with a degree of heterolytic character in the transition
states associated with these late transition metal SBM pro-
cesses, with C–H activation resembling an intramolecular proton
transfer.31
2.2.
SBM at LnM–boryl bonds
The success of the catalytic alkane hydroborylation4 has prompted
a number of computational studies on the mechanism of this
process.14 The C–H activation step has been studied by Hall
for [CpFe(CO){B(OMe)2}(CH4)] and [CpW(CO)2{B(OMe)2}-
(CH4)].32 Both systems proceed by what Hall calls a “metal-
assisted-SBM” with rather short M ◊◊◊H contacts of 1.50 A
˚
(Fe) and 1.75 A
˚ (W). A localised orbital analysis, however,
has been interpreted in terms of very little oxidative character
in the transition state. Instead the transferring H is protonic
in nature and the reaction is assisted by the electron pair of
the M-B bond. A Mulliken charge analysis suggests that this
process is itself supported by back donation from the metal
into the vacant p-orbital on boron, 4. Similar conclusions were
found for methane activation step at {CpRh(H)(BO2R)} R =
–CH2CH2–.33
2.3.
SBM at LnM=CR2 and LnM≡CR bonds
Hall has stressed the isolability of the {LnM–BR2} and
{LnM=CR2} moieties33 and has studied C–H activation in
[CpW(NO)(CH2)(CH4)] and [CpW(CO)(CH2)(CH4)]- species. In-
triguingly, pathways corresponding to both a one-step SBM
and a two-step OA/RE mechanism can be characterized for
these systems (Fig. 5). For the nitrosyl species, SBM is slightly
more accessible, while OA/RE is preferred with the anionic CO
analogue.34 The major geometric differences between the SBM
transition state and OA/RE intermediate are in the C–W–C angles
(40–50◦wider in the OA intermediate) and W ◊◊◊H distances (ca.
0.1 A
˚ shorter in the OA intermediate). More recently, activation
of sp2 and sp3 C–H bonds by 1,2-addition across a titanium
alkylidyne (M≡C) has been reported. DFT calculations suggested
a SBM-like transition state.35 More detailed calculations showed
that there was a degree of polarisation in the transition state
and the process corresponds to a heterolytic splitting of the
C–H bond.36 The behaviour of this M≡CR species is similar
to that seen with M–OR/NR2 systems (see below) and may
reﬂect the presence of occupied orbitals on the accepting ligands
in each case. For the M≡C systems this takes the form of
occupied p-bonds, whereas the heteroatomic species have lone
pairs available. By analogy, M=CR2 species should show similar
behaviour.

Overview
The above discussion highlights the range of late transition
metal LnM–C/B systems where computation shows SBM to
occur. Several of the research groups active in this ﬁeld have

proposed mechanistic interpretations of these processes and the
area is now awash with acronyms. Computational studies have
focused on the nature of the transition state, thus OATS (Lin),
OHM (Goddard) and MASBM (Hall). In addition, Perutz and
Sabo-Etienne have proposed the s-CAM (s-complex-assisted
metathesis) mechanism, based on the experimental observation
of reactant and product E–H s-complexes. E is most commonly
H, SiR3 or BR2, but in principal this idea extends to C–H
s-complexes.37 Hall has used the atoms-in-molecules (AIM)
approach38 to characterise different transition states in terms of
the varying patterns of bond critical points (BCP) and ring critical
points (RCP) (see Fig. 6).39 Hall assigned these to transition states
for (from left to right) SBM (computed for [Cp2Sc(CH3)(CH4)]
and [Pt(acac¢)2(Ph)(C6H6)]+), MASBM ([Pt(acac¢)2(CH3)(CH4)]+),
OATS/s-CAM ([Ir(acac¢)2(C2H4Ph)(C6H6)], OA/RE ([Cp*Ir-
(PMe3)(CH3)(CH4)]+) and OHM ([Ir(acac¢)2(CH3)(CH4)]). This
last pattern is also seen for an intermediate formed via OA (e.g.
([Cp*Ir(PMe3)(CH3)H(CH3)]+).

Despite this elegant outcome, it seems likely that a continuum of
transition state structures will be formed as more computational
data become available on SBM processes. Indeed Hall refers to a
‘spectrum of mechanisms for metal-mediated hydrogen transfer’
and other workers have emphasized this in their work.16,23 This
continuum is already apparent in the range of Ru ◊◊◊H distances
reported by Gunnoe and Cundari. In addition, a common feature
of these SBM processes is that C–H activation involves a degree
of heterolytic character and therefore proton transfer. Subtly
‘different’ mechanisms can therefore correspond to a different
source of stabilization for this proton (electrons from the metal
centre or from the acceptor M–ligand bond) or the degree of
substrate acidity/acceptor group basicity. In this context, it is
interesting to note that recent calculations on the SBM reactions of
CH4 with [Cp2M–Me] species (M = Sc, Y
, La, Ce, Sm, Ho, Yb and
Lu) are characterised by polar transition states with near-linear
{Med- ◊◊◊Hd+ ◊◊◊Med-} moieties that suggest a proton transfer
process.40 As with late transition metal systems, C–H activation is
computed to become more accessible when a more acidic hydrogen
is transferred.41
A ﬁnal issue concerns the relative accessibility of OA/RE vs.
SBM in late transition metal systems. In several cases discussed
above SBM appears to become ‘necessary’ only when the metal
centre is not sufﬁciently electron rich to achieve an OA process,
or perhaps when steric factors render a more highly coordinated
intermediate inaccessible. However, there are now several cases
where both SBM and OA have been characterised for the same
system.34,42 As more instances of this emerge the patterns that
favour one process over another will become clearer. In the
meantime, computational work must be careful to consider all
possible pathways before deciding that the lowest energy route has
been deﬁned.
3.
C–H activation at LnM–X bonds (X = O, N)
(1,2-addition)
As discussed above, recent computational studies of SBM at M–C
bonds suggest that these reactions can often be viewed as a proton
transfer between a polarised C–H bond and a polarised M–C
bond. Consistent with this idea the more polarised the starting
M–C bond the faster the proton transfer. One might predict
therefore that the related process in which a proton is transferred
from a C–H bond to a more strongly polarised M–X bond (X =
O, N) would be more facile (this process is also referred to as
1,2-addition). Another interesting question in these reactions is
whether the lone pair on the acceptor atom (O, N) facilitates
transfer of the hydrogen as a proton.
The earliest experimental examples of net 1,2-addition of C–H
bonds to early transition metal M=X (X = O, N) double bonds
were provided by the groups of Bergman43 and Wolczanski.44 Some
of these complexes will even activate methane and computational
studies of these reactions have also been reported44b,c (see also
the discussion of the activation of sp2 and sp3 C–H bonds by
1,2-addition across a titanium alkylidyne (M≡C) in Section 2.3
above).
The reactions of late transition metal amides with C–H bonds
has been known for some time.45 However most early examples
of this type of reactivity involve outer sphere acid–base type
chemistry in which the metal plays a spectator role and the
reactivity is rather similar to an alkali metal amide.45,46 Such
reactions initially lead to ion pairs; substitution of the amine by the
anion may subsequently take place. To achieve the net 1,2-addition
of a C–H bond to an M–X (X = O, N) bond requires a vacant site
on the metal. This positions a Lewis acidic/electron deﬁcient metal
adjacent to a nucleophilic/basic heteroatom providing ambiphilic
reactivity, ideal for a heterolytic splitting of a substrate bond. This
process is related to the heterolytic splitting of H2 across an M–X
bond which is well established47 and indeed plays a key role in
many hydrogenation catalysts.48,49
The ﬁrst examples of net 1,2-addition of a non-acidic
C–H bond to an M–X (X = O, N) single bond were observed
experimentally in 2005 by the groups of Gunnoe and Periana.50,51
Gunnoe et al. ﬁrst reported the C–H activation of benzene with
[TpRu(PMe3)2(OH)].50 This complex undergoes H/D exchange
with C6D6 at the hydroxide ligand and will catalyse H/D exchange
between C6D6 and H2O at 100 ◦C. Detailed kinetic experiments
showed that the dissociation of PMe3 was occurring prior to H/D
exchange and the selectivity for H/D exchange at the meta and
para positions of toluene is consistent with a metal-mediated
process. DFT calculations on a model system showed that the
reaction (Scheme 2) is substantially endergonic (DG = +18.4 kcal
mol-1) consistent with the ﬁnal phenyl complex not being observed
experimentally. Similarly, the formation of [(Tab)Ru(PH3)2(Ph)]
and water was calculated to be endergonic (DG = +9.1 kcal mol-1).

Location of the transition state gave a free energy barrier to C–H
activation of +17.6 kcal mol-1 relative to an h2-benzene complex
intermediate. The corresponding barrier for activation of benzene
by {(Tab)Ru(CO)(Me)} was calculated to be +21.2 kcal mol-1.
Subsequently, Gunnoe et al. extended this C–H activation
chemistry to [TpRu(PMe3)2(X)] (X = OPh, NHPh, NH2, SH, Cl,
OTf).52 Of these the NHPh complex showed H/D exchange of
the NH group with C6D6, however the complexes X = NH2, SH,
Cl, OTf did not undergo C–H activation (note the NH2 complex
decomposed under the reaction conditions).52 They suggested that
the ease of C–H activation is related to the basicity of the group
receiving the hydrogen and that C–H activations at non-dative,
heteroatom-based ligands coordinated to low oxidation state late
transition metals would entail inherently lower activation barriers
than similar reactions with metal–alkyl or aryl bonds.
In an attempt to understand more about the various factors
affecting the energetics of 1,2-additions Cundari and Gunnoe
carried out a more extended computational study of C–H acti-
vation by the series of complexes [(Tab)M(PH3)2X]q (X = OH or
NH2; M = Tc or Re, q = -1; M = Ru, q = 0; M = Co or Ir, q =
+1; M = Ni or Pt, q = +2).53 The ﬁrst step in the C–H activation
was loss of phosphine to provide a formally 16-electron ﬁve-
coordinate species which may be stabilised by p-donation by X. In
this study h2-benzene adducts were only observed for the dicationic
Ni or Pt complexes (X = OH, NH2) and the monocationic [Ir–OH]
complex. The increased interaction between the metal and benzene
correlated well with the metal acidity as judged by the computed
charge on the metal, although the authors emphasise that their
calculations ignored solvation effects hence charge effects may
dominate. Electron deﬁciency at the metal may be compensated
by coordination of benzene or p-donation from the amide. The
hydroxo complexes have more acidic metal centres than the amido
ones (NH2 is a stronger base than OH based on gas phase proton
afﬁnities) hence there are more stable benzene adducts in the
hydroxo series.
The transition states for benzene activation have a 4-centred
geometry with an obtuse angle at the hydrogen being transferred
and relatively short M–H distances (Fig. 7). However, the M-H
distances are longer on average (8% for OH and 12% for NH2) than
the estimated M–H covalent bond lengths and AIM38 analyses
on representative structures were consistent with no M-H bond
being present in the transition state. In addition, for activation
of benzene by [(Tab)Ru(PH3)X] (X = Me, NH2, OH) there is a
substantial difference in the transition states between X = Me
and X = NH2/OH with a much shorter M–H distance in the
transition state for X = Me (Fig. 7). They ascribe this difference
to the presence of the lone pair on NH2/OH, thus the directed
sp3 hybrid on Me less effectively bridges the transferring hydrogen
and the metal. This is similar to the selectivity for transfer of H
over alkyl in SBM observed by Bercaw et al. in 1987,28 and similar
conclusions have been reached in computational studies.14,54a

[(Tab)Ru(PH3)(X)] where X = Me, NH2, OH.53
Cundari and Gunnoe conclude that this type of C–H bond
activation is inherently more facile when the receiving atom is
anionic and heteroatomic than hydrocarbyl and the mechanism
should be viewed as an internal proton transfer. They also note that
the complexes with more electrophilic metals give earlier transition
states (shorter C–H distances, longer X–H distances). Similarly,
earlier transition states are computed when an NH2 is the accepting
ligand compared to OH, as might be expected from the higher
basicity of the former. The M–X distances in the transition states
are closer to the products than to the active 16-electron species
which they ascribe to a more signiﬁcant contribution to the C–H
activation from the ligand than from the metal. It is interesting to
note that if the metal is made more electrophilic, by oxidation,
the nature of the C–H activation chemistry can be radically
altered. Thus, oxidation of [TpRu(PMe3)2(OH)] by AgOTf gives
[TpRu(PMe3)2(OH)]OTf, which can abstract hydrogen atoms
from relatively weak C–H bonds e.g. forms benzene from 1,4
cyclohexadiene.55
Periana et al. showed that [Ir(acac¢)2(OMe)(L)] (L = MeOH,
pyridine) reacts with benzene at 160 ◦C to produce an Ir–Ph
complex and that use of C6D6 led to formation of CH3OD.51
The reaction is insensitive to added oxygen and CH activation
of toluene only occurs in the meta and para positions consistent
with a non-radical process. Calculations were interpreted in terms
of a reaction proceeding via a SBM-type process rather than
oxidative addition. The complexes also catalyse H/D exchange
between D2O and C6H6 presumably via an Ir–OH species and
this was subsequently veriﬁed experimentally.56 Experiments in
the presence of added pyridine, and comparison of the kinetic
isotope effect (KIE) for reaction of [Ir(acac¢)2(OH)(Py)] with a
mixture of C6H6 and C6D6 (kH/kD = 1.07 ± 0.24) with that for
1,3,5-trideuteriobenzene (kH/kD = 2.65 ± 0.56), are consistent with
rate determining coordination of benzene followed by faster C–H
activation. Calculations accurately model the KIE and show that
the reaction is energetically favourable (DG = -6.8 kcal mol-1) and
that the transition state for C–H cleavage is only 6.7 kcal mol-1
higher than the benzene adduct.
More recently, Oxgaard et al. carried out a detailed orbital
analysis of the mechanism of the C–H activation step in the
reaction of [Ir(acac¢)2(OMe)(Py)] with benzene and concluded
that the forming O–H bond is not based on the same orbital
as the breaking O–Ir bond.57 The transition state is similar to
that for [(Tab)Ru(PH3)(OH)] (Fig. 7) with a C ◊◊◊H distance of
1.29 A
˚ slightly shorter than that, 1.39 A
˚ , for the RuII complex,
consistent with an earlier transition state for the more electrophilic
IrIII. The analysis is not consistent with a traditional SBM
mechanism but rather with an activation of the C–H bond by
an electrophilic metal generating a positively charged hydrogen,
which is then transferred to the metal-bound hydroxide i.e. to
an internal base. Hence, they used the term internal electrophilic
substitution (IES) to describe the mechanism. They note the
similarities with heterolytic activation of dihydrogen47 and with
an asymmetric sigmatropic rearrangement. Interestingly, changing
the nature of X in [Ir(acac¢)2(X)(C6H6)] (X = OMe, OCF3,
NH2) has very little effect on the activation energy barriers
(less than 2 kcal mol-1).57 In contrast, for the model system
[(Tab)Ir(PH3)X(C6H6)] the difference in DG‡ is 11.3 kcal mol-1
between X = OH and NH2 with the barrier being lower for
OH.53

Whilst there is no doubt that the electrophilicity of the metal
is playing an important role in the C–H activation, the term IES
does not perhaps convey the extent to which the heteroatom lone
pair plays a role in the activation of the C–H bond. Indeed, as
suggested by Gunnoe and Cundari53 the C–H activation is easier
in the case of X = OH than X = Me; they also emphasise the
signiﬁcant contribution to C–H bond scission from the ligand.
In conclusion, the net 1,2-addition of C–H bonds to an M–X
bond (X = O, N) occurs via a 4-centre transition state. However,
there is no M–H bonding interaction and the forming X–H bond
is not based on the same orbital as the breaking M–X bond. Thus,
these processes are fundamentally different to conventional SBM
and involve a concerted ambiphilic electron-deﬁcient metal and
basic ligand acting together to cause a heterolytic scission of the
C–H bond. For further discussion see below.

“Electrophilic” C–H activation at late transition
metals mediated by carboxylate or carbonate bases
Theoretical calculations have also offered insights into “elec-
trophilic” type C–H activations. So-called Shilov chemistry has
been known since 1969 and has been reviewed.2,58 Such chemistry
has been the subject of a number of computational studies and
the C–H activation step has been modelled as oxidative addition
or an electrophilic or SBM mechanism, aided by inter- or intra-
molecular base.59–61 In this section we will concentrate on the
more recently studied systems of “electrophilic activation” of C–H
bonds which involve carboxylate or carbonate as base. Parallels
with Shilov type chemistry will be made where appropriate.
4.1.
Intramolecular C–H activation
Cyclometalated complexes of the platinum metals were ﬁrst
reported in 1965.62 The facile cyclometalation by palladium
acetate, particularly of N-donor ligands had been well studied
experimentally in the 1980s and 1990s. Ryabov had proposed
that cyclopalladation of dimethylbenzylamine occurred by an
electrophilic substitution via a Wheland intermediate with sub-
sequent intramolecular deprotonation by coordinated acetate via
a 6-membered transition state (Fig. 8, 5).63 Detailed mechanistic
studies, including volume of activation measurements, suggested a
highly ordered transition state. Similar studies on cyclopalladation
of imines led Gomez to propose a related mechanism but with
a highly ordered 4-membered transition state for intramolecular
deprotonation (Fig. 8, 6).64 Such a process would be closely related
to the 1,2 additions discussed in Section 3. Distinguishing between
these two possibilities by experiment is virtually impossible,
however DFT calculations can shed light on the dilemma.
Fig. 8
Proposed transition states (5, 6).63,64a and calculated agostic inter-
mediate (7) in cyclometalation of dimethylbenzylamine by [Pd(OAc)2].65
Davies and Macgregor published the ﬁrst computational study
of these processes in 2005.65 The calculations on [Pd(DMBA-
H)(OAc)2] (DMBA-H = dimethylbenzylamine) located an inter-
mediate in which an acetate arm has been displaced by one ortho-
C–H bond of DMBA-H. The interaction between the electrophilic
PdII centre and the C–H bond was more consistent with an agostic
structure, rather than a Wheland intermediate formed by elec-
trophilic attack on the p-system (Fig. 8, 7). In addition, the agostic
interaction, although rather weak (Pd ◊◊◊C and Pd ◊◊◊H distances
of 2.28 and 1.91 A
˚ , respectively), is sufﬁcient to polarize the C–H
bond and allow acetate to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond
to the transferring hydrogen. Thus, the process is best viewed as
an ambiphilic activation, by an electrophilic metal centre and an
intramolecular base. The rate-determining step is computed to be
formation of the agostic intermediate via the k2–k1displacement
of acetate. Subsequent intramolecular deprotonation occurs with
a minimal energy barrier (<1 kcal mol-1). C–H activation via the
6-membered transition state was shown to be more favourable
than the type of 4-membered transition state suggested by Gomez,
although both these processes were considerably more favourable
than an alternative oxidative addition of the C–H bond followed
by reductive elimination of acetic acid. Interestingly, the central
role of an agostic intermediate suggests that C–H activation in
such systems may not be limited to aryl C–H bonds and this has
proved to be the case (see below).
Subsequently, Davies and Macgregor showed that cyclometa-
lation of DMBA-H with [Cp*2IrCl2]2 in the presence of sodium
acetate occurred by a very similar mechanism. Calculations on
the model intermediate, [CpIr(DMBA-H)(k2-OAc)]+, (Fig. 9, 8a)
showed the 6-membered transition state to give 9a was favoured
over a 4-membered process via 8b to 9b or oxidative addition to
an IrV species, 9c.66 In this case, unlike palladium, no intermediate
agostic complex was observed on the calculated reaction path.
The main activation energy barrier again seems to be related
to converting a k2-acetate to k1 and once this is done there is
essentially no barrier to C–H activation. The importance of the
intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the activation was further

demonstrated in the preference for N-H activation over C–H
activation in cyclometallation of a pyrrole imine.67
Related base-assisted cyclometallation reactions have also been
incorporated into schemes for Pd-catalysed intramolecular aryla-
tion. These reactions typically involve initial oxidative addition of
an aryl C–Br bond with cyclometallation occurring at a pendant
substituent of the resultant M–aryl ligand. Echavarren, Maseras
and co-workers reported an early combined experimental and
theoretical study of such a process, where 10 reacted to give either
11 or 12, depending on the substituents, R (Scheme 3).68 Their
experimental studies suggest the key step to be a C–H activation
in which the hydrogen from the phenyl is transferred as a proton,
rather than via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism.
Scheme 3
Originally, the authors favoured an initial exchange of bromide
(generated by C–Br oxidative addition), by bicarbonate. This
then allowed the C–H cleavage to occur through a 6-membered
transition state with strong hydrogen bonding between the proton
being transferred and the bicarbonate (Fig. 10 TS 10C) with
a calculated energy barrier of 23.5 kcal mol-1. An alternative
4-membered transition state with bromide as the acceptor (TS
10A) (c.f. intramolecular transfer to chloride in Shilov chemistry)59
had a rather higher energy barrier of 43.3 kcal mol-1. In their later
full paper69 the authors gave further consideration to a mechanism
in which the bicarbonate is not bound to the palladium but
still assists the C–H cleavage step by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding (TS 10B) (c.f. intermolecular transfer to chloride in Shilov
chemistry).60 The calculated energy difference between an inter-
and intra-molecular proton abstraction was at most 6 kcal mol-1,
but which was the favoured pathway depended on the substituents
on the ring being activated. The calculations accurately reproduce
the trends in reactivity, i.e. electron-acceptor substituents in the
ring being activated favour the reaction to give 11, while electron-
donating substituents drive the reaction to the unsubstituted ring
(i.e. formation of 12, Scheme 3). In a further study70 these workers
showed that bidentate phosphines are excellent ligands for this
process and concluded that at least in this case the reaction
Fig. 10

proceeds by an intermolecular base-assisted proton abstraction
mechanism.
Similar strategies have allowed the activation of sp3 C–H bonds
to be exploited in synthesis. Fagnou et al. investigated the reactions
of substrates such as 13 (Scheme 4) and calculations again show
concerted palladation/intramolecular proton abstraction via 6-
membered transition states. The computed results also correctly
reproduce the observed selectivity i.e. formation of a 6-membered
palladacycle by activation of a primary C–H bond (TS 13A DG‡ =
27 kcal mol-1) is favoured over formation of 6-membered pal-
ladacycle by secondary C–H activation (TS 13B DG‡ = 32.5 kcal
mol-1) or formation of a 7-membered palladacycle by activation
of a methyl (TS 13C DG‡ = 33.1 kcal mol-1), respectively.71 The
transition states all feature an agostic interaction between the
activating C–H bond and palladium in combination with hydrogen
bonding to the acetate.
Scheme 4
Baudoin, Clot et al. also studied sp3 C–H activation in the for-
mation of benzocyclobutenes (Scheme 5).72 Even in this case with
formation of a strained 4-membered ring C–H activation is still the
rate limiting step as conﬁrmed by a KIE of 5.8. Surprisingly, the
computed product of initial C–Br oxidative addition (Fig. 12, 14)
has phenyl trans to phosphine and bromine trans to the vacant site
whereas in [Pd(Ph)(Br)(PtBu3)] characterised crystallographically
by Hartwig et al.73 Br is trans to phosphine with aryl opposite

the vacant site (Fig. 12, 15). Calculations conﬁrm that the X-ray
isomer (15) is more stable by 6.5 kcal mol-1.
Calculations of the substitution of Br in 15 by various bases
yielded (k2-O2CX)Pd complexes (X = Me, OH, O-) which give rise
to transition states for C–H activation analogous to those found by
Fagnou71 (Fig. 11); however the activation energy barriers (DE‡)
are rather higher (33–45 kcal mol-1 compared with 27.0 kcal mol-1)
and C–H activation is computed to be strongly endothermic.
The trends in computed DE‡ (acetate lowest, carbonate highest)
are also completely opposite to those found experimentally.
Computation of C–H activation from the other isomer (14)
proceeds via (k1-O2CX)Pd complexes, which, in contrast with
the bromo complex 15, have a clear agostic interaction with one
C–H bond on the tBu group on the aromatic ring. Proton transfer
from C(sp3) now occurs in a plane perpendicular to the P–Pd–Ph
axis (Fig. 12, 16). The DE‡ values are much lower (27.5–29.2 kcal
mol-1), the reaction is computed to be exothermic and the greater
reactivity of carbonate is now correctly modelled. Thus, these
calculations demonstrate that the carboxylate/carbonate does not
need to be located cis to the site being activated in the square plane.
Computational studies of such direct arylation reactions are
not limited to palladium. Maseras, Dixneuf and co-workers
studied ruthenium-catalysed arylation of 2-phenyl pyridine.74
They concluded that the most likely mechanism involves proton
abstraction by coordinated bicarbonate, however in this case the
proton is transferred to the metal bound oxygen via a 4-centre
transition state.
4.2
Intermolecular C–H activation
The Pd(II) catalysed coupling of benzene with an alkene via a C–H
activation was demonstrated experimentally by Fujiwara as long
ago as 1967.75 This reaction and others have traditionally been
thought to proceed by an electrophilic aromatic substitution. In
2000 Sakaki carried out a theoretical study at the MP4(SDQ) level
on the activation of benzene and methane by [M(h2-O2CH)2] (M =
Pd, Pt) and [M(PH3)2].76 He concluded that [M(PH3)2] cannot
easily achieve C–H activation but that [M(h2-O2CH)2] can because
the formate ligand assists the C–H bond activation through
formation of a strong O–H bond. Key geometric parameters
for the computed intermediate (17) and transition state (18) for
benzene activation with [Pd(h2-O2CH)2] are shown in Fig. 13. The
reactions go via intermediates in which a C–H bond displaces
one arm of a bidentate acetate and the C–H bond that is
broken lengthens signiﬁcantly in the transition state. An electron
distribution analysis showed that in the C–H activation the atomic
population of M signiﬁcantly increases while that of H remarkably
decreases. These data are consistent with an heterolytic ﬁssion of

˚ .
the C–H bond in which electrophilic attack of M to benzene or
methane occurs concomitantly with the proton abstraction by the
carboxylate ligand. These transition states are very similar to those
computed for formate assisted heterolytic activation of dihydrogen
by a ruthenium catalyst.77
In 2006 Fagnou et al. reported78 the catalytic direct arylation of
perﬂuorobenzenes.79 Experimentally they showed that the reaction
was favoured for electron deﬁcient arenes i.e. a complete reversal of
selectivity in comparison with electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Computational studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a
concerted arene metalation and C–H bond cleaving process which
depends directly on the acidity of the C–H bond being cleaved.
The lowest energy pathway was computed to be transfer of the
proton to Pd-bound bicarbonate via a 6-membered transition
state (c.f. TS 10C in Fig. 10). As seen in Maseras’ work, transfer
to coordinated bromide (c.f. TS 10A, Fig. 10) was a higher
energy alternative. Fagnou used the term concerted metalation
deprotonation (CMD), which also emphasises the dual role of
metal and (intramolecular) base. In this case a pathway involving
intermolecular deprotonation by external bicarbonate could not
be located. Later, Fagnou et al. showed the experimental beneﬁt
of adding pivalic acid, and calculations suggested pivalate had
a slightly lower (1.3 kcal mol-1) transition state energy than
bicarbonate.80 We have shown that for intramolecular deprotona-
tion variation in the pKa of the base has only a rather small effect
on activation energy barriers since the base strength is somewhat
reduced by coordination to the metal.81
Interestingly, in a more wide-ranging study of direct arylation
reactions across a broad range of aromatic substrates Gorelsky
and Fagnou82 were unable to ﬁnd any evidence for Wheland-type
intermediates but instead found the lowest energy route to involve
6-membered transition states in which very little charge builds up
on the aromatic ring. This is a very similar pattern to that found
in cyclometallation reactions.65 This pathway correctly predicts
the regioselectivity for all the arenes studied regardless of their
electronic properties. An activation-strain analysis showed that
p-electron rich aromatics have the most favourable interaction with
the metal (most negative Eint) values but that these are offset by the
highest energetic cost of distorting the catalyst and arene from the
ground state to the transition state geometries. Electron deﬁcient
arenes have less favourable Eint but a more facile arene distortion
so the transition state remains accessible. Benzene is not favoured
by either value and has the highest DE‡ of the arenes evaluated.
Overall they concluded that this type of mechanism may be more
widespread than previously thought in direct arylation reactions
and may apply even to electron rich aromatics previously assumed
to go via electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Periana et al. have recently compared C–H activation by
K[Pt(pic)(TFA)2] (pic = picolinate) 19 and Pt(bpym)(TFA)2
(bpym = 2,2¢-bipyrimidyl) 20 and considered the effect of the
charge on the complex on the overall C–H activation process.83 The
calculated DH‡ for C–H activation of benzene by complex 19 was
21 kcal mol-1 (experimental activation barrier for H/D exchange
between C6H6 and CF3CO2D was 23 kcal mol-1), signiﬁcantly
lower than the value for the bpym complex 20 of 27 kcal mol-1.
The C–H activation occurs in two steps, k2–k1 displacement of
one TFA and coordination of the arene and then activation of the
C–H bond. For complex 20, the DH for the ﬁrst step is 14 kcal
mol-1 with the subsequent C–H cleavage step having an activation

barrier, DH‡, of 13 kcal mol-1. For complex 19, the DH for the ﬁrst
step, displacement of an anionic TFA from the anionic complex,
is much easier than from the neutral one at ~5.0 kcal mol-1 and
the DH‡ for C–H cleavage shows only a slight increase to ~16 kcal
mol-1. Thus the main difference in overall rates of H/D exchange
for these complexes (TOF for complex 19 is about 300 times that
for 20) is due to more favourable coordination of benzene, with
the overall C–H cleavage step being relatively unaffected by the
overall increase in negative charge of the complex.
In a recent study, Ess et al. have carried out a transition state
energy decomposition study of C–H activation of benzene and
methane by [Ir(acac¢)2(X)] (X = OAc and OH).84 Hydroxide can
only act as an intramolecular base with a 4-membered transition
state (see Fig. 14, 21; this process is termed ES by this group) but
acetate can have a 4-membered or 6-membered transition state
(Fig. 14, 22 and 23, respectively). As found previously,65,66 C–H
activation via 6-membered 23 is favoured over 22, for both benzene
and methane activation by about 20 kcal mol-1, it is also favoured
by about 15 kcal mol-1 over 21. The authors conclude the most
signiﬁcant contribution to the energy difference between 23 and 22
is the energy required to deform the reactants into their transition
state geometries. For activation of benzene in 22 the C–O bond
lengths of the acetate are rather different at 1.35 and 1.21 A
˚ ,
changing these to 1.25 and 1.28 A
˚ , respectively, (as found in the 6-
membered transition state) lowers the fragment distortion energy
by ~13 kcal mol-1. The authors also point out that the transition
states for the hydroxide and 4-membered acetate are very similar,
indeed we feel these should be considered as the same process (see
below).

Overview of heteroatom-assisted C–H activation
Since 2000, several computational studies have shown that the
combination of an electrophilic metal and a lone pair on an
internal base, either metal-bound (4-membered) or pendant
(6-membered) can lead to the concerted ambiphilic activation
of C–H bonds. Davies and Macgregor also commented on the
possible synergic effect of the two components.67 Thus, interaction
of the C–H bond with the electrophilic metal makes the C–H
bond more acidic which in turn facilitates hydrogen bonding from
the heteroatom lone pair. It is now easy to rationalise the great
success of carboxylates, as well as bicarbonate and carbonate (and
possibly phosphate) in palladium catalysed reactions involving a
C–H activation step as being in large part due to their ability to act
as an intramolecular base.65 In some cases, however, it is possible
that such bases act in an intermolecular fashion.69,74 In passing,
it is worth noting the resemblance between the 6-membered ring
transition states discussed here and those associated with Noyori’s
transfer hydrogenation catalysts.85 This also involve metal–ligand
bifunctional cooperativity,48,86 and calculations87 have shown that
transfer of the hydrogen from the alcohol to the catalyst occurs
via a cyclic 6-membered transition state.
As pointed out in Section 3, C–H activation at M-X bonds (X =
O, N) involves little, if any, M–H bonding interaction. Moreover,
the forming X–H bond is not based on the same orbital as the
breaking M–X bond. Thus, these processes are fundamentally
different to conventional SBM at M–H, M–C and M–B bonds. In
this regard C–H activation reactions at M–X bonds can then be
considered as another variant of a concerted ambiphilic activation,
where an electron-deﬁcient metal and a basic ligand cause the
heterolytic scission of a C–H bond.
The term internal electrophilic substitution (IES) has been
suggested for C–H activation of benzene at an Ir–OH bond (see
21, Fig. 14). However, in our opinion this does not convey the
extent to which the heteroatom lone pair plays a role in the
activation of the C–H bond. It is the concerted dual activation that
make these processes different from a conventional electrophilic
process and why their selectivity is different to conventional
electrophilic aromatic substitution. The term concerted metalation
deprotonation (CMD) has been used by Fagnou and this certainly
emphasises the dual nature of the process. However, given that
recent studies on SBM suggest these also have polarised transition
states and can therefore be thought of as involving deprotonation,
we feel it would be useful to distinguish concerted ambiphilic
activations from SBM. Hence we propose that such processes
should be termed ambiphilic metal ligand activations (AMLA),
essentially showing that there must be an available “lone pair” on
the ligand, with the number of atoms involved in the transition
state, where known, listed in parentheses. Thus, in Fig. 14, 21 and
22 correspond to AMLA(4) processes and 23 is an AMLA(6).

Conclusions
The last decade has seen great progress in the information that
computational chemistry can provide about reaction mechanisms,
information that would otherwise be extremely difﬁcult, if not
impossible, to obtain by experiment. In particular, mechanistic
subtleties abound in the ﬁeld of C–H activation. SBM processes
are now recognized to be accessible in a much wider range of metal
complexes than previously, but delineation from OA reactions can
only be routinely achieved computationally. Close collaboration
between experiment and computation has provided a much better
understanding of C–H activations at M–X bonds (X = O, N) and
those mediated by carboxylate or carbonate bases. This powerful
synergy has facilitated the discovery of new catalysts where C–H
activation can be exploited in synthesis. Heteroatom-assisted
C–H activations are particularly prominent in these developments
and the common features of such processes appear to be the
simultaneous ambiphilic activation by a Lewis acidic metal centre
and an intramolecular base. We therefore suggest use of the
acronym AMLA (ambiphilic metal ligand activation) for such
reactions.
