σ-Bond Metathesis of Alkanes on a Silica-Supported Tantalum(V) Alkyl Alkylidene Complex: First Evidence for Alkane Cross-Metathesis
Graphical Abstract
Die C-C-Aktivierung nichtaktivierter Alkane mit einem Neopentyl-Neopentyliden-TaV-Komplex auf einem Kieselgelträger liefert die Kreuzmetatheseprodukte tBuCH2R – und einen Alkanmetathese-Katalysator [Gl. (1)]. Da die Aktivitäten und Produktverteilungen denen ähneln, die mit einem TaIII-Hydrid auf SiO2 erhalten wurden, tragen diese Ergebnisse zum Verständnis der σ-Bindungsmetathese mit Metallhydriden bei.
Here we report on direct evidence for the stoichiometric cross-metathesis of several alkanes (ethane, propane, and butanes) with the hydrocarbyl ligands of the surface complexes [(≡Si−O)xTa(=CHCMe3)(CH2CMe3)(3−x)] (1: x=1, 2: x=2), and the catalytic activity of 1+2 in alkane metathesis.1
We have shown that the silica-supported tantalum hydride [(≡SiO)2TaH] (3) catalyzes the metathesis of alkanes (Scheme 1).2, 3 The key steps proposed for the reaction mechanism are: a) activation of the C−C bond of an incoming alkane on the surface Ta alkyl complex 4 leading to the evolution of an alkane and the formation of a new surface complex 5; and b) regeneration of 4 in an alkyl-exchange reaction (C−H bond activation).4

Alkane metathesis by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.
The related structures of 1+2 and 4/5, the two key intermediates of the proposed mechanism for alkane metathesis, is noteworthy. This analogy led us to investigate the relative reactivity towards alkanes of 1+2, a formal d0 10-e metal center, and 3, (the precursor of 4/5) a formal d2 8-e metal center.
After reaction of ethane with 1+2 (see Experimental Section), analysis of the gas phase showed the formation of methane, propane, and butanes, that is, the usual metathesis products of ethane. This demonstrates that TaV complexes can also act as precursors to the active species in alkane metathesis (Figure 1 and Table 1).5 In addition, other products that have so far not been observed in the metathesis of ethane in the presence of 3 were also obtained, namely, neopentane (NpH) and 2,2-dimethylbutane (NpMe), which are presumably derived from the neopentyl groups of 1+2 (Table 1, entry 1). The corresponding reaction of 13C-monolabeled ethane with 1+2 gave monolabeled NpMe6 and unlabeled neopentane, and thus provided clear evidence for a cross-metathesis process. Since 1+2 contains both neopentyl and neopentylidene ligands, two pathways can be considered (Scheme 2): a) a one-step mechanism involving activation of the C−C bond by a Ta−C bond (σ-bond metathesis); b) a two-step process involving the Ta=C bond, that is, addition of a C−C bond to a Ta=C bond7 followed by an α-H abstraction,8 which is overall an apparent σ-bond metathesis process. Both processes can explain the formation of the observed products.

Carbon–carbon bond activation on 1+2.
The reaction of 1+2 with ethane also gives neopentane, the formation of which does not involve a C−C bond cleavage, but rather the activation of a C−H bond (Scheme 2). Since neopentane is the major product, C−H activation is kinetically favored over C−C activation. A C−H bond is in fact about three times easier to activate than a C−C bond of ethane under these conditions.9 Since the neopentyl and neopentylidene ligands were transformed by ethane into NpH and NpMe, the surface Ta complex now bears methyl (or methylidene) and ethyl (ethylidene) ligands;5 it is therefore similar to 4/5 or 1+2 and results in the subsequent catalytic metathesis of ethane (Table 1).
The reaction of other alkanes with 1+2 gave similar results, that is, catalytic alkane metathesis and formation of NpH and other neopentyl-containing products NpR (Table 1 and Figure 1). Propane gave NpMe and 2,2-dimethylpentane (NpEt, entry 2). Butane afforded NpMe, NpEt, and 2,2-dimethylhexane (NpPr), in contrast to isobutane, for which NpMe and only traces of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (NpiPr) were detected (entries 3 and 4). This clearly shows that each alkane gives specific products that depend on both its structure and the structure of the surface Ta alkyl complex (in the stoichiometric case: neopentyl). Moreover, the cross-metathesis leading to the transfer of one carbon atom from the incoming alkane to the surface alkyl fragment (NpMe) is favored over that of larger carbon fragments, as previously suggested by the observed selectivities for higher hydrocarbons in the catalytic reaction.2 The absence of reverse C−H activation products such as NpR for the reaction of RH on 1+2 is noteworthy. Hence, an order of reactivity can be proposed (Figure 2).

In conclusion, the reaction of C−C σ bonds with a surface Ta complex containing both neopentyl and neopentylidene groups yields cross-metathesis products that were clearly identified by the tBu “markers” and an active catalyst for σ-bond metathesis of alkanes. The surface complex 1+2 (TaV d0 system) gives turnovers and selectivities comparable to those obtained with 3 (TaIII d2 system). This suggests that both systems probably lead to the same active catalyst. Since σ-bond metathesis has been mainly found for d0 transition metals, that is, metals in their highest oxidation state, it suggests that the active species could be a TaV compound in both cases.10 However, we do not yet know which of the two oxidation states, if not both, is responsible for this unusual reactivity towards alkanes. Further studies are currently underway to clarify this matter.
Experimental Section
The reactions were carried out with the same batch of catalyst in the strict absence of oxygen and water. 1+2 (50 mg, 0.013 mmol, 4.8 % Ta) was introduced into a Pyrex batch reactor (300 mL) followed by an alkane (500–600 equiv), dried and deoxygenated over freshly regenerated molecular sieves (3 Å) and deoxo. The reaction mixture was then heated at 150 °C. Small-volume aliquots were removed, brought to atmospheric pressure, and analyzed by gas chromatography (HP 5890 apparatus, Al2O3/KCl on fused silica column, 50 m×0.32 mm) and GC-MS.
