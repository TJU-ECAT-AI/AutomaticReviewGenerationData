interactions of 2.29 (1) A for co(3) and O(7) and 2.43 (1) A for 
Co(1) and O(3). These are similar to the long interaction seen 
in the titanium compound. However, in the more complicated 
cobalt complex it is more difficult to decide whether or not these 
close contacts represent real bonds or are just a result of geometric 
constraints imposed by the ligand. 
Another feature of interest in these complexes is the possibility 
of a host-guest interaction, whereby a small molecule fits inside 
the cone of the calixarene. The crystal structure of the clathrate 
p-tert-butylcalix[4]areneH4.PhMe 
has already been reported.28 
The cobalt complex 4 crystallizes with five toluene molecules. Two 
of these are involved in a host-guest interaction. A typical ar- 
rangement is shown in Figure 5. 
The titanium complex 2 
crystallizes with three toluenes in the asymmetric unit, and one 
of these is incorporated into the cone. By contrast, the iron

complex 3 has one and one-half molecules of n-hexane in the 
asymmetric unit and neither of these is found within the cone. 
The reason for this difference in behavior is not immediately 
obvious, since the cone opening is both flexible and wide. If one 
takes the distances between opposing carbons bonded to the 
tert-butyl groups as a measure, the openings are 7.49 X 9.18 8,

Abstract: The reaction of the organolanthanide complexes Cp’2MC12-Li(ether)2t, 
Cp’ = $-(CHJSCs, M = La, Nd, Sm, and 
Lu, with LiCH[Si(CH3)J2 provides a straightforward route to the broad class of ether- and halide-free bis(pentamethy1- 
cyclopentadienyl) lanthanide alkyls, Cp’,MCH[Si(CH,),],. 
These complexes were characterized by standard analytical 
methodology. The M = Nd complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2,/n with four molecules in a cell of dimensions 
(-100 “C) a = 11.045 (9) A, b = 23.554 (7) A, c = 11.648 (9) %., 
and p = 103.10 (6)’. Least-squares refinement led to 
a value for the conventional R 
index (on F) 
of 0.078 for 4287 independent, absorption-corrected reflections having I > 344. 
The molecular structure consists of monomeric Cp’,NdCH[Si(CH3)J2 units with a “bent-sandwich” 
Cp’,Nd configuration: 
(ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) = 134.4’. The CH[Si(CH3)J2 
fragment is coordinated to the Cp’,Nd group in a highly 
unsymmetrical fashion with a Nd-C o-bond distance of 2.517 (7) %. and a rather short secondary contact to a single methyl 
carbon atom of 2.895 (7) A. Spectroscopic data suggest that this interaction is higly metal-to-carbon in character. The 
Cp’2NdCH[Si(CH3)3]z 
complexes react with H2 
under mild conditions to yield the corresponding hydrides (CP’,MH)~. 
These 
complexes are extremely active homogeneous ethylene polymerization catalysts with turnover frequencies exceeding 1800 SKI 
(25 ‘C, 1 atm of ethylene pressure) for M = La. Activities are in the order La I 
Nd >
>
 Lu. The kinetics of this process 
and the molecular weight characteristics of the resulting polymer are severely limited by mass transport effects; evidence is 
presented that these are “living” polymers and that chain transfer by @-hydride 
elimination is not important. For La and Nd, 
propylene and 1-hexene react rapidly at -10 ‘C to yield equal quantities of the disproportionation products alkane + metal 
q3-alkenyl. Butadiene undergoes reaction with these hydrides to yield q3-crotyl 
complexes, and significant polymerization does 
not occur. For 1-hexene under low H2 
(or Dz) 
pressure at room temperature, some formation of 2-methylundecane is also 
observed. The analogous reaction of cyclohexene with these hydrides is sluggish and appears to produce an 7’-cyclohexenyl 
complex. There is no evidence for cyclohexene oligomers. Although unreactive toward olefins, C P ’ ~ N ~ C H  
[Si(CH3)3]2 
reacts 
with CO to yield a dimeric dionediolate. 
Much of the recent development of early transition- and f- 
element hydrocarbyl and hydride chemistry can be attributed to 
the beneficial characteristics of bis(pentamethylcyclopentadieny1)

forwardly (Le., in as little as one “pot”) synthesize a broad class 
of stable Cpr2MR 
complexes5 
ranging from the lightest (M = La) 
to the heaviest (M = Lu) lanthanide.’* The interesting chemical 
and unusual structural properties of these molecules are then 
discussed, including the diffraction-derived crystal structure of 
CP’,N~CH(TMS)~. 
In addition, hydrogenolysis readily yields 
the corresponding series of hydrides, (CP’,MH)~, 
from M = La 
to Lu. The rather extraordinary reactivity of these molecules is 
demonstrated herein by their very high activity for olefin oli- 
gomerization and polymerization. It is thus possible to compare 
the behavior of early lanthanides with Watson’s recent results on 
L u . ~ , ~ ‘  
However, the Cp’,M ligation array may be far from 
optimum for organolanthanide coordinative unsaturation, and 
approaches to “opening” as well as immobilizing the supporting 
ligation are illustrated by a companion chemical/structural study13 
of organolanthanide hydrocarbyls and hydrides with a chelating 
X[(CH3)4C5]2 
ligand.I4 In a third contributi~n,’~ 
we then focus 
in detail on the kinetic and mechanistic aspects of olefin hydro- 
genation by the above two classes of organolanthanides. Re- 
markably little is known about the nature of such processes for 
early transition- and f-element homogeneous catalysts, and the 
present hydrides are of particular interest as some of the most 
active homogeneous olefin hydrogenation catalysts yet discovered. 
Experimental Section 
Materials and Methods. All operations were performed with rigorous 
exclusion of oxygen and moisture in flamed Schlenk-type glassware in 
a dual-manifold Schlenk line or interfaced to a high-vacuum ( 
torr) 
system or in a dinitrogen-filled, Vacuum Atmospheres glovebox with a 
high-capacity atmosphere recirculator. Argon (Matheson, prepurified), 
ethylene (Matheson, CP), propylene (Matheson, CP), dihydrogen 
(Linde), and deuterium gas (99.5’76, Matheson) were purified by passage 
through a supported MnO oxygen removal column’6 
and a Davison 4A 
molecular sieve column. Aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents were pretreated 
with concentrated H2S04, KMnO, solution, MgS04, and Na + 4A 
molecular sieves. All reaction solvents were distilled from Na/K/ 
benzophenone under nitrogen and were condensed and stored in vacuo 
in bulbs on the vacuum line containing a small amount of [Ti(qS- 
CSH5),CI],ZnCl2 
as indi~at0r.I~ 
Cyclohexane and heptane were addi- 
tionally vacuum-transferred onto Na/K and stirred for at least a day 
before use in catalytic experiments. The olefins 1-hexene (Aldrich Gold 
Label) and cyclohexene (Aldrich Gold Label) were purified by stirring 
over Na/K for at least 6 h and were freshly vacuum-transferred. Deu- 
terated solvents were dried over Na/K alloy and vacuum-transferred 
before use. 
Anhydrous lanthanide halides were prepared from the corresponding 
oxide and ammonium chloride.I8

Physical and Analytical Measurements. Proton and carbon NMR 
spectra were recorded on either a Varian EM-390 (CW, 90 MHz) a 
JEOL FX-90Q (FT, 90 MHz), or a JEOL FX-270 (FT, 270 MHz) 
complexes were circuitous for late lanthanides7 and virtually 
unknown for early (La-Nd) lanthanides.* The latter were of 
greatest interest to us since U(III)6 and Nd(III)5 
are isoelectronic, 
because the early organolanthanides have the greatest importance 
in catalysis’ and because, a priori, the early lanthanides might, 
for a given ligand array, offer the greatest degree of coordinative 
unsaturation and possibly reactivity. In planning syntheses, the 
use of highly lipophilic, sterically bulky R functionalities (as in 
our uranium work6) was anticipated so that undesirable coordi- 
nation to the lanthanide ion of ether or halide ligands (normally 
present during the preparation of Cp’,MR complexes) could be 
avoided. In most d-element hydrocarbyl syntheses, the choice of 
R is also frequently dictated by the desire to avoid destabilizing 
@-hydrogen 
atoms. However, it now appears that @-alkyl 
elim- 
ination (e.g., eq 1) may be an equally important decomposition 
pathway for some organo-f-element complexes and must also be 
considered in ligand selection. 
Ligands such as CH[Si(CH,),], (CH(TMS)2)6as10 
offer both 
the attraction of substantial lipophilic bulk and a lack of @-hy- 
drogen atoms as well as a defense (heretofore largely unrecog- 
nized) against @-alkyl 
elimination since such an extrusion process 
would produce a relatively high-energy” Si=C bond (e.g., eq 2).

high vacuum, and the residue extracted with 50 mL of pentane. Sub- 
sequent filtration, slow cooling of the filtrate to -78 OC, filtration, and 
drying produced 0.600 g (27%) of Cp’,SmCH(TMS), as red-brown 
crystals. An additional 0.400 g (18%) of product can be recovered from 
the mother liquor (total yield 45%):

(15). A solution of Cp’,NdCH(TMS), (1

sphere at 0 O C .  The resulting precipitate of (Cp’,NdH), was filtered off 
and washed well with cold pentane. The hydride was then suspended in 
50 mL of pentane at -78 O C ,  and with stirring, a 3-4 M excess of 
propylene was introduced. The suspension was slowly warmed to -1 5 O
C
 
and then stirred for 3.5 h at this temperature (dissolution of the hydride 
was visible by -30 “C). At this time, all the hydride had reacted (as 
evidenced by dissolution), and the excess propylene and pentane were 
removed in vacuo. The residue was then redissolved in 30 mL of pentane 
and slowly cooled overnight to -78 OC. The resulting large green-brown 
crystals were filtered off and washed with cold pentane to yield 0.49 g

Olefin Polymerization Experiments. These experiments were con- 
ducted in a 500-mL flamed round-bottom reaction flask attached to a 
high-vacuum line. The flask was fitted with Morton-type indentations 
and an overhead mechanical stirrer (high speed stirring motor, large 
Teflon paddle). The shaft of the stirrer could be sealed to allow high- 
vacuum pump down. The flask was also equipped with two straight-bore 
high-vacuum stopcocks. In 
a typical experiment, the exterior connecting 
tube of one stopcock (ca. 10 mm in length) was sealed with a new serum 
cap. The reaction vessel was then pumped down for several hours, 
back-filled with inert gas, the stopcock closed, the flask reevacuated, and 
a measured quantity of solvent (cyclohexane or heptane) vacuum- 
transferred into the reaction flask from Na/K. Next, gaseous ethylene 
or propylene was admitted to the vessel through the gas purification 
column. The gas pressure was continuously maintained at 1 .O atm with 
a mercury manometer apparatus. Rapid stirring of the solution was 
initiated, and after several minutes (to allow saturation of the solvent with 
olefin), the stopcock was opened and a small aliquot of 5.0 mM catalyst 
solution in cyclohexane injected by a gastight syringe just above the 
rapidly stirring solution (the syringe needle had been flattened so that 
the catalyst solution exited in a fine spray). In the case of ethylene, 
voluminous quantities of polyethylene formed within seconds. After a 
measured time interval, the polymerization was then quenched by in- 
jecting methanol through the serum cap of the second stopcock. The 
polymeric product was collected by filtration, washed with methanol, and 
dried under high vacuum. Identical results were obtained when using 
toluene as the reaction solvent. 
Attempts to polymerize propylene via the above procedure produced 
only what appeared to be traces of oligomers. Pressurized reactions in 
cyclohexane solution using a Kontes quartz Worden vessel were no more 
successful. 
For I-hexene/ethylene copolymerizations, ethylene gas was admitted 
at various pressures to a stirring solution of the catalyst in I-hexene. 
Quenching of the polymerization and product isolation were as described 
for polyethylene (vide supra). 
Reactions with 1-Hexene. By using high-vacuum techniques, ap- 
proximately 0.25 mmol of (Cp',NdH), or (Cp'zLaH)z was allowed to 
react with a ca. IO-fold excess of I-hexene in I O  mL of pentane. The 
reaction was begun at -78 "C and was brought to -10 "C over a period 
of 2-3 h. After several additional hours at -10 "C, the hydride had 
dissolved. The solvent and other volatiles were then removed under high 
vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in cyclohexane-d12. 
The resulting 
solution was filtered and then transferred to an NMR tube in the 
glovebox. Assignments refer to structure L in the text.

The I-hexene dimer was prepared by slowly stirring 50 mg of the

Large 
green prismatic crystals of this complex were grown by slow cooling of 
a pentane solution to -30 OC. Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were 
cleaved from the larger crystals in a glovebox and sealed in glass capil- 
laries. All diffraction studies were carried out on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 
instrument at -100 "C. Monoclinic symmetry inferred from the unit cell 
parameters was confirmed by an analysis of symmetry equivalent inten- 
sities. Systematic extinctions were consistent with the space group PZ,/n. 
Accurate unit cell parameters were determined by least-squares refine- 
ment of 24 high-angle reflections. Three-dimensional data were collected 
(5721 independent reflections having 20MoKa 
< 52") using graphite- 
monochromated Mo radiation and, because of the sizable mosaic spread, 
w scans (w scan width = 1.2" + 0.35 tan 8". Crystal and/or instrumental 
instability was monitored through the measurement of six standard re- 
flections that were collected after every 100 min of X-ray exposure time; 
there was no indication of crystal decomposition. Experimental details 
are given in Table I. 
All calculations were performed on a VAX 11/730 computer with the 
SDP crystallographic software packagez5 
and programs standard in this 
laboratory. An empirical absorption correctionz6 
was applied from av- 
eraged transmission factors determined from psi scans of nine Bragg 
reflections. Neutral atom scattering factorsz7 
were used with anomalous 
dispersion correctionsz8 being applied to the non-hydrogen atoms.z9 
The position of the Nd atom was determined from a Patterson sum- 
mation. Extension of the model was accomplished by using the direct 
methods program DIRDIF" and standard Fourier techniques. It was

Highly Reactive Organolanthanides 
obvious from the preliminary Fourier syntheses that the Cp’ ligands were 
disordered; two positions of equal height could be located for each Cp’ 
methyl carbon atom. An additional data set was collected on a second 
crystal at a higher temperature in the hope of finding a higher temper- 
ature phase without disorder, but the subsequent structure solution re- 
vealed the same characteristic problem. Eventually it was possible to 
deconvolute the disordered ring atoms. For each Cp’ ligand, there are 
two orientations which are related to each other by a rotation of ap- 
proximately 3 6 O ,  i.e., the two ring orientations are staggered relative to 
each other. In 
the final disorder model, all Cp’ atoms were assigned fixed 
occupancies of 0.5 (based on the relative heights of the original Fourier 
calculations), the methyl carbons were refined anisotropically, and the 
ring carbons were refined isotropically. All other non-hydrogen atoms 
in the model were refined anisotropically. The large thermal parameters 
for the C atoms of one of the Si(CH3), groups may arise from a slight 
orientational disorder that is caused by the different Cp’ orientations. 
Hydrogen atom positions were calculated for the methyl carbons of 
the Si(CH,), groups assuming idealized staggered configurations. The 
hydrogen atoms were included in the model as fixed contributors to the 
structure factors assuming isotropic thermal parameters of 1 A2 greater 
than that of the atom to which they were attached. The final agreement 
indexes are given in Table I. The four largest peaks (1.7 (2)-1.9 (2) 
e/A3) in the final difference electron density map are located in the 
vicinity of the Nd atom. An analysis of the data as a function of data 
collection order, weighting scheme, sin B / X ,  etc., showed no unusual 
trends. 
Results and Discussion 
Synthesis. Hydrocarbyls. There are many examples in orga- 
nolanthanide chemistry4 where synthetic approaches and meth- 
odology that work well with late lanthanides become increasingly 
more problematic as the series is traversed to the left. Factors 
such as charge/ionic radius ratio3’ are no doubt important. In 
the present case, the synthesis 
of Cp’2MC12-Li(ether)2+ 
complexes 
(eq 3) is straightforward for M = Nd,,O Sm, and Lu;,l however,

‘H and 13C NMR spectral data for the various Cp’,MCH- 
(TMS)2 
complexes are given in the Experimental Section. For 
7 
and especially 6, the spectra are isotropically shifted and 
broadened due to the partially filled f shells, but are still readily 
interpreted. Two diamagnetic examples are shown in Figure 1.

In 
all cases, the Si-CH,.groups are magnetically equivalent, but 
the Cp’ rings are nonequivalent, suggestive 
of a conformation such 
as A. For Cp’,NdCH(TMS),, which exhibits the largest isotropic 
A 
shifts (hence the greatest sensitivity and longest spectral time 
scale), these relationships persist to -90 O
C
 in toluene-d8. This 
result will be seen to be of particular significance in light of the 
diffraction results (vide infra). Also unusual in the NMR spectra 
are the small magnitudes of ’ 
JC-H 
for the methine carbon atoms: 
e.g., 90.0 Hz in 1. The corresponding ‘JC-H 
values for the si- 
lylmethyl groups (124.5 Hz in 6) 
are unexceptional. There is 
nothing in the infrared spectral data (see Experimental Section) 
which would suggest unusual CH-M interactions.

(6). The 
X-ray structural analysis reveals that single crystals of 6 are 
composed of monomeric Cp’,NdCH[Si(CH,),], units as shown 
in Figures 2 and 3. Final atomic coordinates and anisotropic 
thermal parameters are given in Tables I1 and 111,24 respectively. 
Important bond lengths and angles are given with estimated 
standard deviations in Table IV according to the atom labeling 
scheme in Figures 2 and 3. Although an orientational disorder 
of the Cp’ rings limits the accuracy of the structure determination, 
significant conclusions can be drawn about 6. Moreover, these 
are in complete agreement with the more precise structure of a

(TMS)2)3C1- 
(Yb-C = 2.373 (24), 2.372 (16), and 2.391 (20) 
A).36 Assuming for the moment that this complex is formally 
eight-coordinate, corrected distances of 2.497 (24), 2.496 (16), 
and 2.515 (20) 8
,
 
are calculated for eight-coordinate Nd3+, 
while 
assuming that formal Yb six-coordination yields eight-coordinate 
Nd3+ 
distances of 2.615 (24), 2.613 (16), and 2.632 (20) A. Thus, 
the present Nd-Cl distance is not unusual. As regards the TMS 
groups, the average Si-CH3 distance of 1.856 (1 
7, 23, 44, 6) 8,34 
compares favorably with similar distances in a number of tri- 
methylsilyl  compound^.^' The Sil-C2 contact of 1.890 (9) 8
,
 
is probably longer than the average Si-CH, distance, but this is 
on the edge of statistical significance (the corresponding 
difference 
in 9 is ~ignificant’~). 
The Cl-Si1 and C1-Si2 distances of 1.813 
(8) and 1.814 (8) A, respectively, are slightly shorter than the 
corresponding distances of 1.889 (4) 8
,
 
in H2C[Si(CH3)3],37d 
and 
1.888 (6) 8, in HC[Si(CH3)3]3.37d 
In common with 6, the ap- 
preciable steric congestion gives rise to relatively large Si-C-Si 
angles of 123.2 (9)’ and 116.3 (4)O, respectively, in the latter two 
compounds. 
In addition to the Nd-Cl u bond, the unsymmetrical CH- 
(TMS)2 
coordination involves a rather short, ostensibly nonbonding 
Nd-C2 contact of 2.895 (7) A-only 
0.378 8
,
 
longer than Nd-CI. 
This contact is significantly shorter than the sum of the CH, van 
der Waals radius (2.0 A)38a 
and either the Nd single bond radius 
(1.6 
metallic radius (1.8 A),38b 
or even eight-coordinate 
ionic radius (1.108 A).31 
It is not obvious from inspecting Figures 
2 and 3 that the unsymmetrical CH(TMS), coordination is a direct 
consequence of intramolecular nonbonded repulsions, and it will 
be seen to be even less so in 913 
where the (CH3)4C5 
ligands are 
”pulled back”. From the structure of 9 and also by implication, 
6, 
it will be seen that the disposition 
of the a-hydrogen atom (bent 
toward the metal) is also not an obvious source of the distortion. 
Rather, it appears that the Nd-C2 interaction is a consequence 
of the marked electron deficiency at the metal center and rep- 
resents one of several recent 4f examples (the only one for an early 
lanthanide) where some degree of three-center two-electron 
bridging alkyl group interaction exists (e.g., B). Other examples 
include Cp’,Lu(p-CH3)LuCp’,(CH,) (C),4b Yb(N(TMS),),-

cases D, E, and F, the multicenter interaction 
is A12(CH3)6-like42 
in that it does not involve exclusive (“agostic”) 
C-H.-M intera~tion,~~ 
but rather C-M interaction. This will 
be reinforced for 6 in the structural discussion of 913

CH3 
hydrogen atoms have been located and found to conform to 
the dispositions 
in D and E (the latter inferred from the analogous 
Y structure). 
To compare the Yb-C distance of 3.04 A in D with that in 6, 
an assumed Yb2+ 
six-c~ordination~’~ 
was converted to eight-co- 
ordinate Nd3+, giving a hypothetical Nd-C distance of 3.13 
A-clearly 
longer than the 2.895 (7) 8
,
 
in 6. Correcting the fully 
bridging 2.51 1 (35) A, (av) Yb-CH, distance of E 
in a similar 
manner yields Nd-C = 2.635 (35) A, while that in E (2.60 (2) 
8
,
 
(av)) becomes 2.73 (2) A; both contacts are somewhat shorter 
than in 6. Although the structure of 6 evidences considerable 
distortion, it is important to note that in common with D and F, 
the distortion does not lie in a deep potential well, and at room 
temperature, bridge and terminal methyl groups are undergoing 
rapid intramolecular permutation. Only in the case of F4’ is the 
barrier large enough to allow observation of the instantaneous 
structure in the low-temperature solution ‘H NMR. As already 
noted, Si1422 may be longer than Si-CH, (av), but for the present 
structure determination, this difference is not statistically sig- 
nificant. This is not the case in the more precise structure de- 
termination for 9,13 
where the analogous difference is statistically 
significant. This result, the close Nd-C2 contact, and the ap- 
proximately eclipse relationship of the Cl-Nd and Si1422 vectors 
are reminiscent of syn-periplanar reaction coordinates for @-hy- 
dride elimination and suggest that the geometry in 6 is a plausible 
conformation for incipient @-methyl 
elimination (eq 1). In 
the 
present case, however, elimination would create a high-energy 
Si=C functionality,’ ’ which appears to be energetically inac- 
cessible (thermolysis 
in toluene-& yields CH2(TMS)2 
as the major 
CH(TMS)2-derived product). 
Synthesis. Hydrides. As we first discovered in 1978,44 
lan- 
thanide-to-carbon u bonds suffer hydrogenolysis to yield the 
corresponding  hydride^.^.^^ In the present case (eq 5 ) ,  reaction 
is complete within minutes at 0 OC, and the sparingly soluble 
hydrides 10-13 are isolated in virtually quantitative yields.

our hands, 
the hydride functionality undergoes rapid exchange with the

the hydride signal in 13 could only be located in C6D12, while that 
in 10 (Figure 4) is visible for hours in C,D6. The low-field shift 
of the La-H resonance is characteristic of do and fo systems;45 
it is also observed in f14 13. Presumably as a consequence of the 
slow electron spin-lattice relaxation time, the hydride signals in 
11 and 12 could not be located. Complete infrared data for 10-13 
and the analogous prepared with D2 (10d-13d) are set out in the 
Experimental Section. Several representative spectra are shown 
in Figure 5. M-H modes can be identified by subtracting readily 
identified Cp’-centered  transition^^^ and by reference to the 
deuterium-substituent analogues. However, the latter spectra are 
complicated somewhat by significant scrambling of the label into 
the Cp’ ligands. From the data, it can be seen that the infrared 
spectra of 10, 11, and 12 are essentially superimposable and differ 
distinctly from that of 13. Although the hydrogen atoms were 
not located,8b

to G and exhibits, consistent with local C, symmetry, infrared- 
active antisymmetric (1215 and 11 
14 cm-') and symmetric (844 
and 650 cm-') stretching modes.45 Depending on the local sym- 
metry, G could exhibit two (DZh), 
three (Dz), 
or four (C,) M-H 
stretching transitions (assuming all are resolved and of detectable 
intensity). As exemplified by 10 (Figure 5, C, D), G-type mol- 
ecules exhibit a strong, broad transition at ca. l 120 cm-' which 
shifts to ca. 800 cm-' in 10d4 (vM-H/vM-D = 1.40). Furthermore, 
there appear to be weaker transitions at ca. 940 and 750 cm-', 
which shift to ca. 660 (vM-H/vM-D 
= 1.42) and ca. 510 cm-' 
(shoulder, vM-H/vH-D - 
1.47), respectively, upon deuteration. The 
spectrum of 13 
is somewhat less straightforward to interpret 
(Figure 5). Relatively strong, non-Cp' features are observed at 
1345 (br), 1100 (br), and 650 cm-l (br or split), which shift to 
ca. 970 (vM-H/vM-D = 1.39), ca. 860? (vM-H/vM-D - 
1.30), and 
ca. 420? cm-' (very br, vM-H/vM~D - 
1.55). 
Reaction Chemistry with Olefins, Ethylene. As early as 1978, 
we noted47 
that solutions of (Cp',UH), and photolyzed solutions 
of Cp'2U[CH,Si(CH,),]2 were active, apparently homogeneous 
catalysts for ethylene polymerization. The polymer produced was 
of relatively high molecular weight, high melting point, low 
branching ratio, and low polydispersity (&fw/&fn).48 
Subsequent 
attempts to unambiguously determine whether trivalent (Cp',UH), 
and Cp',UR species served as catalysts (initiators) were frustrated 
by the high oxidation state lability of these systems (complex 
mixtures of U(II1) and U(1V) compounds were invariably evident 
in the 'H NMR spectra49). In 
contrast, the isoelectronic 
Nd(II1) 
system is expected to be oxidation-state-stable and along with the 
La(1II) analogue offers an intriguing early lanthanide comparison 
to recent late lanthanide olefin polymerization  hemi is try^^^^^,^^ 
(as well as results on more conventional 
polymerization 
catalysts5'). 
(46) From the residual intensity of the ca. 1100-cm-' band in 10d, it is 
obvious that exchange with a hydrogen source has occurred. A species such 
as 
is a likely product.

As described in the Experimental Section, all polymerization 
chemistry was carried out under rigorously anaerobic, high vacuum 
line conditions. At room temperature and 1 atm of ethylene 
pressure, the Cp',MCH(TMS), complexes (M = La, Nd, and Lu) 
failed to react with ethylene over the course of several hours. 
Although the absence of migratory insertion is rationalizable on 
steric grounds, it should be noted that the same complexes undergo 
rapid M-CH(TMS), bond hydrogenolysis and migratory CO 
insertion (vide infra). In contrast to the Cp',MCH(TMS), 
complexes, the corresponding (Cp',MH), complexes undergo 
extremely rapid reaction with ethylene to produce voluminous 
quantities of polyethylene within seconds of contacting the two 
reagents. 
Data pertaining to the polymerization experiments are set out 
in Table V. 
A number of points are noteworthy. First, it is 
evident that chain propagation is extremely rapid. The approx- 
imate order of reactivity follows decreasing ionic radius: La L 
Nd > Lu. Furthermore, the early lanthanide systems display 
maximum activities comparable to or in excess of those reported 
for the most active "homogeneous" ethylene polymerization 
catalysts discovered to date7b,S2,53 
as well as those for most ho- 
mogeneous organometallic molecule/inorganic support  system^.^^^^^ 
Indeed, (Cp',MH), activities appear to approach those of het- 
erogeneous "third generation" Ziegler-Natta  catalyst^.^^^^^ The 
present compounds also exhibit measurable activity even at -78

“C (entry 13) and are active at room temperature for periods of 
at least 2 weeks. Modest heating (+54 “C) increases turnover 
frequency as well as catalyst efficiency (entry 12). 
The (Cp’,MH),/ethylene turnover frequencies and catalyst 
efficiencies were estimated by quenching the polymerization re- 
action after measured time intervals and weighing the quantity 
of polyethylene produced. As such, these estimates are clearly 
lower limits to the reactivities of the most active La and Nd 
catalysts. Important questions arise concerning the intrusion of 
mass-transport effects as well as possible effects of poisoning due 
to residual traces of air, water, impurities, etc. Information can 
be obtained by studying reaction rates as a function of catalyst 
quantity and concentration (is ethylene “starvation” occurring? 
is a certain quantity of catalyst serving a sacrificial role in sca- 
venging impurities?), reaction time (is the precipitating poly- 
ethylene impeding ethylene diffusion to the catalyst centers?), and 
contrasting behavior of the more active (La, Nd) and less active 
(Lu) catalysts. Relevant data are presented in Table V. When 
identical reaction procedures are carried out for Nd with an 
increased quantity of catalyst at identical overall concentration, 
the apparent turnover frequency and catalyst efficiency appears 
to fall (entries 7 and 8), implicating inadequate monomer delivery 
to the reaction solution15 
(probably due to inadequate stirringlS) 
and arguing that little of the catalyst serves a sacrifical role. A 
general pattern of decreasing N, and decreasing efficiency is also 
observed for La and Nd with increasing catalyst concentration 
(entries 1 and 3 and 4 and 5). This could also be attributed to 
mass-transport effects, although any kinetically important 
equilibrium involving (CP’~MH), 
dissociation would introduce 
qualitatively similar behavior. The rates of dimer dissociation, 
chain initiation, and chain propagation in these systems are not 
known. The highly active La and Nd catalysts also exhibit a 
pattern of decreasing turnover frequency and decreasing efficiency 
with increasing reaction time (entries 1 and 2, 5 and 6, and 8-1 1). 
This behavior appears to reflect restricted ethylene diffusion to 
the entrained catalyst centers as increasing quantities of solid 
polymer accumulate.56aqb In contrast to the above result for the 
La and Nd catalyst, the far less active (Cp’,LuH), system exhibits 
N, and efficiency parameters which are relatively insensitive to 
catalyst concentration and reaction times (entries 14-16). It is 
entirely reasonable that mass-transport effects should be less 
important for the less active catalyst.s6c 
The foregoing conclusions are supported and additional in- 
formation is provided by the GPC data (Table v). For a com- 
pletely homogeneous, kinetically well-behaved (propagation as 
described by k, remains constant throughout the polymerization), 
irreversible polymerization in which termination (described by 
kt), 
chain transfer (described by kc,), 
and poisoning are insig- 
nificant, and in which initiation is instantaneous, a Poisson mo- 
lecular weight distribution is expected for high degrees of po- 
lymerizati~n.~~ 
That is, the polymer (a “living polymer”) should 
be virtually monodisperse; Le., MW/M,, 
= 1.0. Under similar 
constraints but admitting the operability of termination and chain 
transfer (and assuming k,, k,, and k, remain constant throughout 
the polymerization), the ”most probable” molecular weight dis- 
tribution is expected; Le., MW/Mn 
= 2.0.57,58 
We suspect that 
the living polymer regime is operative for the present systems (in 
accord with the long time periods over which activity was 
measurable), modified principally by possible mass-transport and 
heterogeneity effects. In 
regard to irreversibility, the polymeri- 
zation is far from thermoneutral (AH 
= 
-26 k c a l / m ~ l ) ~ ~ ~  
and in 
Jeske et al. 
regard to termination/chain-transfer processes, thermochemical 
datas9 and experiments with 1-hexene (vide infra) argue that 
@-hydride 
elimination (eq 6) should be quite endothermic for a 
straight-chain primary alkyl. The operability of other termination 
MCH2CH2P e 
MH + CH,=CHP 
(6) 
P = polymer chain 
(e.g., Cp’ H atom abstraction), chain-transfer, or impurity-related 
processes is more difficult to assess (reproducibility and entries 
4, 5, and 8 in Table V argue against the intrusion of the latter). 
Nevertheless, the data in Table V generally support the living 
polymer hypothesis. The least active, least mass-transport-in- 
fluenced Lu system exhibits polydispersities consistently below 
2.0. For the more active La- and Nd-based catalysts, polydis- 
persity is low for short reaction times and increases with increasing 
reaction times. This would be in accord with increasing hete- 
rogeneity of the system and an increasing diversity of diffusion- 
influenced propagation rates as the quantity of solid polymer 
rapidly built up. Indeed, typical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts generally exhibit high polydisper~ities.~’ 
The data for 
the -78 “C 
experiment in Table V argue that temperature effects 
on termination processes such as @-H 
elimination are probably 
not important under the present conditions.60 Thus, eq 6 is likely 
to have a large, positive entropy of reaction,s9a 
and if the position 
of this equilibrium controlled &fW/Mn, 
then a greater sensitivity 
to temperature might be expected. Such is not the case. Finally, 
data in Table V showing polymer chains produced per lanthanide 
atom are informative. That the ratios are never greater than 1.0 
argues against extensive 
chain transfer. That they are consistently 
less than 1.0 could arise from mass transport or rate-limiting 
initiation effects, and the data are not extensive enough to draw 
a clear-’cut 
distinction. However, the foregoing discussion, the 
near independence of this ratio on the quantity or concentration 
of organolanthanide (Le., none serves a sacrificial role), and the 
increase of M, with increasing reaction time argues, for the less 
mass-transport-limited Lu system, that poisoning effects are not 
competing with polymerization. Rather, it appears that a process 
such as initiation-limiting dissociation of the (Cp’,MH), dimer 
combined with entrainment of partially or unreacted hydride in 
the growing polymer mass is operative. Further information on 
stoichiometric (Cp’,MH),-olefin reactivity will be presented in 
the following section and in the contribution on catalytic hydro- 
genation.Is Efforts to better characterize the lifetimes and tem- 
perature dependence of the (Cp’,MH),-initiated polymerization 
are continuing.

H3 (6 6.05) appears as a sextet, with JH3..H1,5 = 13.5 Hz (aHl 2.33, 
6H5 3.27) and J H + H 2  - 
9.5 Hz. We assign the H2 resonance as 
being obscured by the Cp’ absorption since irradiation in this 
region collapses the H3 signal to a triplet ( J  = 13.5 Hz). Irra- 
diation at H5 collapses H3 to a doublet of doublets, with J = 9.5 
and 12.9 Hz. Furthermore, irradiation at H3 collapses the H1 
resonance to a singlet and the H5 resonance to a quartet. We 
assign the crotyl methyl resonance to a doublet ( J  = 5.9 Hz) at 
6 1.49. Irradiation at this signal collapses H5 to a doublet (J = 
13.5 Hz). As in the allyl complexes, the Cp’ ligands are mag- 
netically nonequivalent. 
The reaction of 1-hexene with (CP’,L~H)~ 
(10) and 
(Cp’,NdH), (11) was also investigated by NMR. At probe 
temperatures as low as -78 “C in toluene-d8, complete con- 
sumption of hydride by excess 1-hexene 
occurs within a few hours. 
At room temperature, the reaction is essentially instantaneous. 
A single 
organometallic product is observed (no intermediates were 
visible) along with an approximately equal quantity of n-hexane. 
If the reaction is carried out at -10 OC, 
the volatiles are pumped 
off, and the product is dissolved in cyclohexane-d12, 
similar but 
better quality (due to the absence of interfering organics) spectra 
could be obtained. In the case of Nd, the IH NMR spectrum of 
the product is reminiscent of that of Cp’,Nd(q3-C3H5), with 
magnetically nonequivalent 
Cp’ rings and allylic resonances having 
similar isotropic 
shifts (see Experimental Section for details). This 
suggests

assigned and were possibly obscured by residual hexane. Reaction 
of this compound with D20 
yields 1-hexene which was 395% 
hexene-d, by GC/MS. The reaction of (CP’,L~H)~ 
with 1-hexene 
also yields an allylic product, which could be characterized by 
‘H (Figure 6C) and I3C 
NMR, and the similarity of the spectral 
parameters to those of Cp’,La(q3-allyl) and C~’~La(q~-crotyl). 
Thus, we assign H3 at 6 6.01, H1 at 6 2.34, 6 H5 at 3.33, and 
6 H2 as obscured by the Cp’ resonances. These assignments were 
verified by decoupling experiments, which yielded the parameters 
methyl resonance is readily assigned to a triplet at 6 0.68, H7,7’ 
to a multiplet at ca. 6 1.29 (irradiation collapses the 6 0.68 signal 
to a singlet), and H6 and H6’ probably to two multiplets at 6 1.87 
and 2.07 (coupling to H5 is ca. 5.9 and 6.3 Hz, respectively). 
Irradiation of either of the H6,6’ multiplets results in some sim- 
plification of the H

magnetically nonequivalent. The I3C NMR data (see Experi- 
mental Section) are in accord with these assignments. Reaction 
of the La hexenyl complex with D 2 0  
yielded I-hexene which was 
395% hexene-d, by GC/MS. Furthermore, stirring this complex 
in pentane under D2 
yielded n-hexene which was 295% hexane-d3 
by GC/MS. 
Rapidly stirring any of the (Cp’,MH), complexes with I-hexene 
under 1 atm of H2 
(or D,) reveals that they are extremely active 
hydrogenation catalysts (Nt 
values are as high as 120000 h-’!).5 
The details of the catalytic hydrogenation chemistry will be 
presented in the following contribution.I5 It suffices here to state 
that for 1-hexene, the sequence involves (i) addition of metal 
hydride to olefin to produce a hexyl complex and (ii) hydrogen- 
olysis of the metal-carbon bond to yield alkane (hexane-1 
,2-d2 
using D2) and to regenerate the metal hydride. More interesting 
in the present context is the result in neat 1-hexene at room 
temperature under conditions where D, introduction is mass- 
transport-limited (e.g., stirring is inadequate). In this case, besides 
hexane-d,, smaller, nearly equal quantities of hexane-dl and 
hexane-d3 are also observedI5 along with small quantities of a 
hexene dimer (vide infra). This observation agrees with the 
scenario depicted in eq 7 and 8: with Nd-D/D2, 1:l alkane- 
d,/alkane-d, is predicted. At room temperature in neat 1-hexene 
under an even greater deficiency 
of D2, 
the hexene dimer C,,H,,D, 
is obtained in significant quantities along with traces (<1%) of 
a dideuterated trimer (ca. 10% 
of the hexene is oligomerized, the 
remainder being converted to hexanes). On the basis of ’H and 
I3C 
NMR data24@ 
and experiments using H2064 
and MS data,6s 
this hydrocarbon is assigned structure 0, 
and the probable 
mechanism is shown in eq 9. That a hydrogenolytic environment

is required to obtain oligomers suggests that species such as N 
do not readily suffer @-hydride 
elimination (to regenerate hydride 
for further oligomerization catalysis) and also that the  allyl 
is not an important precursor for 1-hexene oligomers under these 
conditions. Qualitatively, it appears that increasing temperatures 
(-10 - 
+30 “C) favor olefin insertion into the metal-carbon u 
bond over competing allylic C-H activation and q3-allyl 
formation.

Consideration of the sterically congested structure of N indicates 
why subsequent 1-hexene insertions are unfavorable. It will be 
seen that the “opened” Me2SiCp”,M (Cp” = s5-(CH3),C5) 
en- 
vironment can alter this situation to a significant degree.I3 The 
reason why propylene oligomerization is less effective in these 
experiments presumably reflects the lower concentrations of the 
gaseous olefin which were achievable under 1 atm of pressure. 
As monitored by IH NMR spectroscopy, the reaction of either 
(Cp’,LaH), or (Cp’,NdH), with cyclohexene 
at room temperature 
is orders of magnitude slower than with 1-hexene. For each metal, 
one major organometallic product is detected. The IH NMR 
spectra of the La and Nd products (see Experimental Section) 
are rather complex and bear little resemblance to those of the 
previously discussed $-allyls; interestingly, the Cp’ ligands are 
magnetically equivalent in these complexes. When D20 
is added 
to these products, the only detectable C6 
species is cyclohexene, 
which is 396% cyclohexene-d, by GC/MS. The proton spectra 
reveal no evidence of the slowing of a dynamic process down to 
-85 “C. From these results, we tentatively assign the ql-allyl 
structure P (possibly fluxional) to the cyclohexene reaction 
products. An $-allyl coordination mode is presumably desta-

bilized by the steric bulk of the cyclohexenyl fragment. There 
is no evidence for the formation of cyclohexene oligomers in these 
reactions. It will be seen in the discussion of catalytic cyclohexene 
hydr~genationl~ 
that some lanthanide cyclohexyl complexes readily 
undergo @-hydride 
elimination. 
Copolymerizations. As already noted, the Cp12M 
coordination 
sphere is apparently too constricted (cf., eq 9) to support the rapid 
polymerization of olefins bulkier than ethylene (few homogeneous 
catalysts are effectives’). However, it was found in exploratory 
studies that hexene could be copolymerized with ethylene by 
stirring hexene solutions of (Cp’,NdH), under an ethylene at- 
mosphere at various pressures. This process presumably involves 
ethylene at the insertion step of eq 9. Since the (Me,SiCp”,MH), 
complexes were found to be more active catalysts, discussion of 
this chemistry is deferred to the next paper in this issue.13 It was 
also found that Cp’2Nd(v3-allyl) 
was effective 
in initiating ethylene 
polymerization. Such a process may involve the monohapto form 
of the allyl (eq 10).

Discussion 
The synthetic chemistry presented here offers straightforward, 
general routes to a broad family of ether- and halide-free bis- 
(pentamethylcyclopentadieny1)lanthanide 
alkyls and hydrides. The 
hydrides are of course greatly desirable synthetic targets for 
catalytic studies but are equally valuable precursors for numerous 
types of ether- and halide-free lanthanide hydrocarbyls and other 
derivatives4 One result of this work is thus a readily accessible, 
homologous series of tractable, thermally stable, very electrophilic 
(for which there is structural evidence), and very highly reactive 
lanthanide alkyl/hydride pairs which span the 4f block from the 
lightest (4P) 
to the heaviest member (4fI4). In 
chemistry involving 
olefins, significant reactivity differences are 
observed between light 
(La, Nd) and heavy (Lu) lanthanides. For example, the light 
members appear to be the most active “homogeneous” ethylene 
polymerization catalysts prepared to date. For bulkier olefins, 
allylic C-H activation and q3-allyl formation are found to compete

Abstract: This contribution discusses lanthanide hydrocarbyl and hydride chemistry based upon Me,SiCp”, supporting ligation 
(Cp” = q5-(CH3),C5). The reaction of MC13, M = Nd, Sm, or Lu, with Me,si(C~”Li)~ 
yields the precursor complexes 
Me2SiCp”2MC1<Li(ether)2+. 
A slightly different workup procedure yielded (Me2SiCp”2NdC1)2C1-Li(THF)2+, 
which crystallizes 
in the monoclinic space group P2/n with two molecules in a unit cell of dimensions (-133 ‘C) a = 11.666 (3) A, b = 12.585 
(3) A, c = 17.765 (6) A, and p = 94.91 (2)’. Least-squares refinement led to a value for the conventional R index (on F) 
of 0.045 for 3231 independent reflections having Z 
Z 3 4 0 .  The structure consists of two Me2Si(q5-Cp”)2Nd 
units bridged 
by a chloride ion and an Nd-CI-...Li+...Cl--Nd 
linkage. The Nd-C1 distances are 2.802 (1) and 2.754 (2) A, and LCI-Nd-CI 
= 97.1 (1)’. The (ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) angle is 121.3’. The Nd-C(ring) distances vary from 2.647 (7) to 2.815 
(7) A, with the shorter distances being to those carbon atoms closest to the Me2Si bridge. The Me2SiCp”,MC1, compounds 
react with LiCH[Si(CH,),], to yield ether- and halide-free Me2SiCp”2MCH[Si(CH3)3]2 
derivatives. The M = Nd compound 
crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2,/n with four molecules in a cell of dimensions (-125 ‘C) a = 10.229 (2) A, 
b = 15.623 (3) A, c = 19.687 (3) A, and @ = 105.41 (2)’. Least-squares refinement led to a value of the conventional R 
index (on F) 
of 0.044 for 3407 independent, absorption corrected reflections having I >  3 4 0 .  The molecular structure consists 
of monomeric Me2SiCp”2NdCH[Si(CH3)3]2 
units with q5-Cp” 
coordination, and L(ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) = 121.6’. 
The CH[Si(CH3)3]2 
fragment is coordinated to the Me,SiCp”,Nd center in a highly unsymmetrical fashion with a Nd-C 
o-bond distance of 2.506 (7) 8
,
 
and a secondary interaction to one methyl group of Nd-C = 2.862 (8) A. 
The Si-C distance 
to this carbon atom is significantly longer than the other Si-CH3 contacts. Approximate hydrogen atom locations argue against 
an important M.-HC(methyl) interaction and reveal a bending of the hydrogen atom on the o-bonded carbon atom toward 
the metal with LNd-C-H - 
76’. Reaction of the Me2SiCp”,MCH[Si(CH3),1, complexes with H2 
yields the coresponding 
hydrides, which are formulated as Me2SiCp”2M(pH)2MCp”2SiMe2 
dimers. These compounds are active agents for the 
polymerization of ethylene as well as for the oligomerization of propylene and 1-hexene. For a constant lanthanide ion, a 
(Me,sic~”,MH)~ 
hydride is an ca. 10 times more active for this reaction than the corresponding (Cp12MH), hydride. 
Deprotonation of Me,SiCp”,LuCH(TMS), with t-BuLilTMEDA leads to a metallacycle formulated as Li(TMEDA)3+- 
Me2SiCp”,LuCH2Si(CH3)2C(H)Si(CH,),-
