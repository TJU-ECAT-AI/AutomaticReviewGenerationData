Abstract: This contribution reports a high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR study of the organoactinides Cp’,Th(CH,),, 
CP’,T~(’~CH~),, 
and [Cp’2Th(pH)H]2 
(Cp’ = $-(CH3),C5) adsorbed on partially dehydroxylated 
(PDA) or dehydroxylated 
(DA) y-alumina. Cross-polarization (CP) combined with magic angle spinning (MAS) and high-power ‘H decoupling produces 
adsorbate I3C NMR spectra of sufficient resolution and sensitivity to obtain significant structural information. On the basis 
of the observed I3C chemical shifts, line widths, and field dependence thereof as well as comparison to a number of model 
systems and dipolar dephasing experiments, methyl transfer from Th to AI on the surface of the support is proposed for the 
reaction of Cp’,Th(’3CH3)2 
with DA. Several types of experiments (Bloch decay, cessation of dipole decoupling, variable 
contact time) suggest that the adsorbed species are not highly mobile. On the other hand, adsorption of Cp’,Th(I3CH3)? on 
PDA results in protonolysis of the Th-CH3 
units and the formation of surface 
Th-@AI aluminoxy species. Useful correlations 
with the companion surface and catalysis study are presented. The utility of I3C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy 
in probing 
surface-bound metal alkyls (especially in proximity to quadrupolar support nuclei) is emphasized. 
Recently there has been a burgeoning interest in the fate of 
transition-metal organometallic complexes adsorbed on the sur- 
faces of high-area metal oxide supports such as y-alumina, silica, 
zeolites, etc.’ With but a few exceptions the structural, chemical, 
and mechanistic properties of the adsorbed species have not been 
established, although such knowledge is highly desirable since the 
supported complexes frequently display unique and enhanced 
catalytic activity relative to the precursor molecules in homoge- 
neous solution. In the accompanying paper,’ we report a detailed 
investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of 
selected organoactinides adsorbed on alumina and silica surfaces. 
The surface chemical studies with partially dehydroxylated (PDA) 
and dehydroxylated (DA) y-alumina supports reveal that meth- 
ane-evolving surface reaction pathways for Cp’zM(CH3)z 
(M = 
Th, U; Cp’ = q5-(CH3)5C5) 
include M-CH3 protonolysis via 
surface hydroxyl (OH) groups (dominant on PDA), Cp’ ring H 
atom abstraction, and intramolecular elimination of methane 
within M(CH,), units.’ On DA (but not on PDA), these com- 
plexes exhibit high activity for propylene hydrogenation and 
ethylene polymerization. However, in the case of DA, well over 
half (depending upon the exact activation conditions) of the methyl 
groups originally bound to the actinide ion remain on the surface 
and, curiously, are not completely accessible to hydrogenolysis 
at 100 OC. In order to further elucidate the structure of sur- 
face-adsorbed species, we turned to high-resolution solid-state I3C 
NMR spectroscopy utilizing cross-polarization (CP), and magic 
angle spinning (MAS)., 
CPMAS NMR4 
is a relatively recent addition to the arsenal 
of instrumental methods available for the study of chemically 
modified surfaces. Investigations utilizing conventional Fourier 
transform (FT) NMR methods5 in general yield well-resolved 
signals only for relatively mobile species (useful information may

MAS NMR spectroscopy has been utilized to probe the 
bulk and surface structures of several metal oxide supports. 
However, there has been very little application of I3C CPMAS 
NMR to the study of catalysts derived from organometallic 
molecules and high surface area metal oxides (the few examples 
involve metal carbonylsI6). 
In this contribution we present a high-resolution 13C 
CPMAS 
NMR study of CP’~T~(CH,), 
and [c~’~Th(p-H)Hl, 
adsorbed 
on DA and PDA. The complexes have been deposited in the same 
manner and at the same loading levels ( < O S  
CP’~T~(CH,),/ 
100 
Az) 
as employed in our companion surface chemical and catalytic 
studies.] To our knowledge, this study represents the first CPMAS 
NMR investigation of a metal alkyl/metal oxide catalyst system. 
It will be seen that the derivation of significant structural and 
dynamic information benefits greatly from the high surface areas 
of DA and PDA’ (ca. 160 m2/g-high 
concentrations of or- 
ganometallic molecules are possible), the availability of 13C-en- 
riched analogues ( C P ’ ~ T ~ ( ’ ~ C H ~ ) ~ ) ,  
the availability of a number 
of CP’~T~(CH,)X 
model compounds, and the unique quadrupolar 
characteristics of the 27Al 
nucleus. Perhaps the most interesting 
and broadly applicable result of this study is the direct evidence 
that alkyl groups on precatalyst molecules can be transferred to 
the surface metal ions of the oxide support.

Materials and Methods. All procedures were performed in Schlenk- 
type glassware interfaced to a high-vacuum (10-4-10” torr) line or in a 
nitrogen-filled Vacuum Atmospheres glovebox equipped with an efficient, 
recirculating atmosphere purification system. Argon (Matheson, pre- 
purified), nitrogen (Matheson, prepurified), and hydrogen (Linde) were 
purified further by passage through a supported MnO oxygen removal 
column and a Davidson 4-A molecular sieve column. Pentane (H2S04 
washed), heptane (H,S04 washed), toluene, and diethyl ether (all pre- 
viously distilled from Na/K/benzophenone) were condensed and stored 
in vacuo in bulbs on the vacuum line. 
I3CH3I 
(99% ”C, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was degassed by 
freezepumpthaw cycles on a high vacuum line and dried by condensing 
in vacuo onto P,O, and stirring overnight. ”CH,Li.LiI (99% 13C)

(DA) were prepared in the following manner. Approximately 1.0 g of 
American Cyanamid PHF y-alumina, 99.99% pure, which had been 
treated as previously described?I was spread in a thin layer (<1 mm 
thick) in a quartz tube. The quartz tube was attached to a high vacuum 
line in a manner such that the main axis was horizontal (in order to 
maintain the alumina in a thin layer), evacuated, and placed in a tube 
furnace, the temperature of which could be monitored continuously with 
a chromel/alumel thermocouple. The alumina was heated for 2 h under 
dynamic vacuum (10-4-10-5 torr) at 475 or 950 O
C
 for PDA or DA, 
respectively. The alumina was then cooled and brought into the glovebox 
for storage and experiments. PDA has ca. 4 surface OH groups/100 A2, 
while DA has ca. 0.12/100 A,.’ 
Reaction of Alumina with Organoactinides. O
n
 
a high vacuum line, 
a solution of approximately 50 pmol of organoactinide complex in pen- 
tane (8-10 mL) was poured onto 0.50 g of either DA or PDA. This 
loading is comparable to typical loadings employed in the surface chem- 
ical studies. The slurry was vigorously stirred under Ar for 1 h at 
ambient temperature while covered by AI foil to exclude light. At the 
end of this time, the suspension was filtered; the impregnated alumina 
was then back-washed once by condensing a small portion of pentane 
from the filtrate into the upper portion of the filtration apparatus. The 
pentane was removed in vacuo and the alumina dried well and brought 
into the glovebox for NMR experiments. 
High-Resolution I3C 
NMR Experiments. I3C 
CPMAS NMR spectra 
were measured at a carbon frequency of 15.0 MHz on a JEOL FX-60QS 
spectrometer with Chemagnetics solid-state accessories. High-power IH 
decoupling and magic angle spinning were employed for the routine 
experiments. Bullet rotors machined to close tolerances from Kel-F were 
used at a spinning speed of 2.2-2.6 kHz. Since the samples are extremely 
air sensitive, rotors were loaded with material inside the glovebox under 
an anaerobic nitrogen atmosphere. The insert of the rotor was coated 
with a light layer of high vacuum silicone grease (Dow Corning) before 
being pressed into the outer part. No ”C resonance was ever observed 
for the grease. No air-induced discoloration of the organoactinide-treated 
alumina samples from white to yellow or brown was observed for any of 
the organothorium samples during the course of an NMR experiment. 
Several other experiments were performed to check the integrity of the 
rotors toward exlusion of air. A solid sample of the oxygen indicator 
[Cp,Ti(p-Cl),],Zn was placed in a rotor; no change from green (starting 
Ti(II1) complex) to yellow (oxidized Ti(1V) complex) was observed over 
a 2-day spinning period. Repeated I3C CPMAS NMR spectra of the 
same sample of Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/DA 
over a period of time were identical. 
Finally, a sample of Cp’,Th(”CH3),/DA was deliberately exposed to air. 
The sample immediately turned bright yellow, then gradually became 
light yellowish brown. A ”C CPMAS NMR spectrum of the air-exposed 
sample contained many very weak signals and was entirely different from 
the relatively simple spectrum obtained from anaerobically manipulated 
samples. In addition, the I3C NMR spectra obtained from five inde- 
pendently prepared samples of the Cp’,Th(I3CH3),/DA system were 
identical. The magic angle was set for each spectrum by observing the 
79Br 
line of a small amount of dry KBr2, which was partitioned from the 
sample in the rotor by a thin Teflon-brand disk. All solid-state ”C NMR 
spectra were externally referenced to liquid Me4Si on the basis of sub- 
stitution of hexamethylbenzene (HMB) as secondary reference and as- 
signing 132.3 ppm to the shift of the aromatic carbons of HMB relative 
to liquid Me4Si. The proton 90° pulse width was 5 ps. For I3C, the 
routinely employed contact time for cross-polarization was 3 ms and the 
repetition time was 4 s. In 
general, 1000-2000 scans were required to 
obtain satisfactory spectra of the neat organothorium complexes, while 
10 000-50000 scans were required for the thorium complexes adsorbed 
on alumina and for the organoaluminum samples. 
Several ”C NMR experiments were performed for Cp’,Th- 
(”CH3),/DA in order to probe adsorbate mobility. One set of experi- 
ments involved obtaining I3C CPMAS NMR spectra under varying 
cross-polarization contact times (0.8, 3.0, and 10.0 ms). This experiment 
can yield information on motions which average 13C-’H dipolar cou- 
pling.gb Interrupted decoupling experiments were performed by inserting 
a 40- or 125-ks delay during which the decoupler is turned off before data 
acquisition. These experiments give information on the number of pro- 
tons coupled to the carbon atoms.23 Finally, two experiments were 
performed which would yield signals only for surface species having 
significant mobility. In the first experiment, a ”C CPMAS NMR 
spectrum of Cp’,Th(13CH3),/DA was obtained in which the high-power 
decoupler was turned off during data acq~isition.~~

performed by the Colorado State University Regional NMR Center on 
a Nicolet NT-150 (37.735 MHz, I3C) spectrometer. The Cp’,Th- 
(13CH3),/DA sample was checked for deterioration upon return via the 
I3C 
CPMAS NMR spectrum. The spectrum obtained was identical with 
that obtained prior to mailing. The returned [(CH3)AIC12]2 
sample was 
checked via ‘H (solution) NMR and showed no decomposition. 
The organothorium complexes were checked for purity via routine ‘H 
NMR (Varian EM-390, 90 MHz, CW, or JEOL FX-90Q, 90 MHz,

cilitated via solution I3C NMR obtained with total and gated decoupling

Cp’ ring carbon (6 123.1), 
Th-CH, (6 68.4), and Cp’ CH, (6 12.0). 
The I3C 
NMR spectrum of neat Cp’,Th(13CH3), (99% I3C en- 
riched) is shown in Figure 1 
B. The chemical shifts are identical 
with those of the natural abundance compound. In 
addition, the 
line widths at half-height (vljz) for the Cp’ ring carbon and Cp’ 
CH3 
resonances 
of neat Cp,’Th(13CH3), are indistinguishable 
from 
those in the unenriched complex; ul/, = 14 and 8 Hz, respectively. 
The line width for the Th-CH, resonance increases only slightly, 
from 14 to 20 Hz. Thus, there is little or no broadening due to 
l3C-I3C dipolar coupling in the spectrum of Cp’,Th( 13CHJ2;

the effects of I3C-J3C dipolar coupling are small enough to be 
eliminated by the MAS4 
The I3C 
CPMAS NMR spectrum of CP’,T~(CH,)~ 
supported 
on DA (Figure IC) shows resonances attributable only to the 
pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands at 6 125.0 and 1 
1 
.O. Line 
widths are approximately 7-10 times greater than for the neat 
complex. Some of this broadening may be due to weighting of 
the FID to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. In 
order to probe 
the fate of the methyl ligands originally attached to Th, 
Cp’,Th(13CH3), was also reacted with DA. The I3C CPMAS 
NMR spectrum of this system (Figure ID) also exhibits reso- 
nances at 6 124.2 and 10.2 
for the ring ligands as in the unenriched 
case (Figure 1C). In 
addition, two new resonances appear at 6 
71 
.O and ca. -20. The former peak may be straightforwardly 
assigned to a Th-CH3 group by comparison to the spectrum of 
Cp’zTh(CH3)2 
(Figure 1 
A) and similar complexes containing a 
Th-CH3 bond (vide infra). The very broad upfield resonance has 
been assigned to an AI-CH, surface species (vide infra).

Most importantly, the broad upfield peak at ca. -12 ppm is no- 
ticeably narrowed at 37.735 MHz (Figure 2B) as compared to 
the 15.0-MHz spectrum (Figure 2A). It can be seen that the 
relative height of this peak is increased relative to the Th-CH3 
and Cp’ CH3 
resonances, and also that the chemical shift of the 
peak maximum is displaced ca. 8 ppm downfield. This result is 
consistent with broadening arising principally from 27Al

field, while increased line broadening would be expected for the 
latter effect. A number of other line broadening mechanisms are 
arguably unimportant. Thus, magnetic field inhomogeneity may 
be excluded as a major broadening source for the upfield line since 
spectra of neat complexes are very sharp (e.g., Figure lA,B) and, 
indeed, the Cp' and Th-CH3 resonances in the supported com- 
plexes are relatively narrow (Figure 1 
C,D). Likewise, missetting 
of the magic angle may be ruled out since with proper experimental 
technique the magic angle may be set within f0.1' using an 
internal KBr sample.22 The resonance due to the ring carbons 
of the Cp' ligands is quite sensitive to the setting of the magic 
angle and is an excellent internal check in these systems. The 
line width and line shape for the ring carbons in Figure 1C,D are 
comparable to those for the ring methyl resonance, indicating that 
proper spinning angle has been achieved. The complex is highly 
enriched (99%) in 13C, 
but 13C-13C dipolar coupling effects should 
be rather small by comparison to Figure 1A,B, where little or no 
broadening was observed in going from neat C P ' ~ T ~ ( C H ~ ) ~  
to 
Cp'2Th(13CH3)2. 
Broadening and/or splitting of I3C and 29Si 
resonances have 
been observed previously in cases of directly attached 14N ( I  = 
1),24-30 
2H ( I  = 1),31 
and 35C1 
( I  = 3/2)30,32 nuclei. Splitting or 
broadening of I3C bound to 27A1 
is expected if the 27Al 
( I  = 5 / 2 ,  
Q 
= 0.149e X 
cm2) quadrupole interaction is comparable 
in magnitude to the Zeeman i n t e r a ~ t i o n . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
In that case, 
the 27Al 
quadrupolar interaction tilts the axis of 27Al 
quantization 
away from the applied field direction so that residual 27Al-'3C 
dipolar coupling is not removed by MAS. The magnitude of the 
residual coupling depends on e2qQ 
(the nuclear quadrupole cou- 
pling constant), 7 
(the asymmetry parameter, (qxx 
- 
qyy)/qrz), 
and 
the magnitude and orientation of the 27Al-13C 
internuclear vector. 
Although insufficient local surface metrical data are available in 
the present system to accurately compute the details of the dipolar 
splitting (further studies are in progress), reported 27Al 
e2qQ/h 
values in the range 7-38 MHz for alkyls and h a l i d e ~ ~ ~ ? ~ ~  
are 
comparable to the 27A1 
Zeeman interaction energy of 15.63 MHz 
at the present field strength. Thus, a major perturbation of the 
I3C line shape is not unexpected. It will be seen that similar 27Al 
quadrupolar effects are evident in the spectra of model compounds 
(vide infra).

A number of NMR experiments were performed to investigate 
the motional characteristics of the Cp'2Th('3CH3)2 
complexes 
adsorbed on DA. A 13C 
CPMAS NMR spectrum obtained with 
the high-power IH decoupler turned off during data acquisition 
and a 13C 
Bloch decay NMR spectrum were featureless. These 
results imply that molecular motion is not sufficiently rapid and 
isotropic 
to significantly 
average C-H dipolar  interaction^.^^ Since 
cross-polarization dynamics are sensitive to molecular m o t i ~ n ? ~ , ~ ~  
13C CPMAS NMR spectra were also obtained with cross-po- 
larization times of 0.8, 3.0, and 10.0 ms. Although signal-to-noise 
ratios varied between the spectra, the relative signal intensities 
within each spectrum were virtually identical. Hence, any 
motional processes significantly averaging the C-H dipolar in- 
teractions cannot differ greatly in a n i s ~ t r o p y . ~ ~  
Interrupted decoupling spectra were obtained with delays of 
40 and 125 ps inserted before data acquisition. At 40 ps, dipolar 
dephasing for fairly rigid protonated carbon groups such as 
methines and methylenes is sufficient that these resonances are 
selectively broadened and essentially disappear.23 The usually 
greater rotational freedom of methyl groups lessens this effect 
and longer delay times (ca. 125 p s )  are required to attenuate 
methyl re~onances.~~ 
Even then, these resonances usually do not 
disappear entirely. Nonprotonated carbons are not significantly 
affected by this technique. 
The 13C CPMAS spectrum of 
Cp',Th( 13CH3)2/DA 
with a 40-ps delay was essentially identical 
with the normal spectrum (1-ps delay). With a 125-ps delay, the 
resonances assigned to Th-CH3, Cp' CH,, and AI-CH3 were 
greatly attenuated relative to the Cp' C resonance, although they

resonances to methyl groups appears secure. 
Figure 3A presents the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum of 
[Cp’,Th(p-H)H],. Two resonances are observed at 6 123.5 and 
12.7. The I3C NMR spectrum of this complex supported on DA 
is reported in Figure 3B. The only resonances observed occur at 
6 125.6 and 10.7. No broad upfield peak (ca. -20 ppm) is observed 
in this spectrum. 
Reactions of PDA with Organoactinides. Figure 4A reiterates 
the 13C CPMAS NMR spectrum of neat Cp’,Th(CH,), for 
convenience. The solid-state I3C 
NMR spectrum of this complex 
supported on PDA is presented in Figure 4B. Only resonances 
due to the Cp’ ligands are observed at L 
.4.6 and 10.6. When 
Cp’,Th(13CH3), is supported on PDA (Figure 4C), another res- 
onance appears in the NMR spectrum at ca. 66.3 ppm in addition 
to the ring resonances. This new peak is in the region characteristic 
of Th-CH, functionalities in Cp’,Th(CH3)OR complexes (vide 
infra). 
Model Compounds. To obtain additional information on I3C 
CPMAS line shapes in typical 27Al-CH3-containing 
solids, several 
model compounds were examined. The 15.0-MHz I3C 
CPMAS 
NMR spectra of typical poly(methyla1uminoxane) samples 
-(OAI(CH,)-),,20 exhibit a broad resonance at ca. -17 to -20 
ppm with a line width and line shape (e.g., Figure 5) almost 
identical with the broad upfield resonance in the 15.0-MHz 
Cp’,Th(I3CH3),/DA spectrum (Figure 1D). I3C 
CPMAS NMR 
spectra of [(CH3)A1C12], 
were obtained at two field strengths 
(Figure 6). At 15.0 MHz, the resonance is split into a multitude 
of broadened peaks. At higher field, the spectrum coalesces 
considerably and the most intense resonance appears to shift to 
the lower field. The changes in line shape and chemical shift for 
the AI-CH, resonance are similar to those observed for the broad 
upfield resonance in Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/DA. 
It is interesting to note 
that the AI-CH3 13C 
resonance is split more severely in the [(C- 
H3)A1CI2l2 
spectrum than in the aluminoxane. This may result 
from differences in e2qQ/h 
and 9 for the two systems. While the 
quadrupolar coupling constant and asymmetry parameters have 
not been measured for either of the present systems, we note that 
e2qQ/h = 25.5 MHz and 9 = 0.51 for [(CH3CH,)A1C12]233 
and 
e2qQ/h = 20.8 MHz and 9 = 0.73 for [(CH3)2AIOCH3]3.34 
In order to determine how the Th-CH3 chemical shift varies 
as a function of Th coligands, I3C CPMAS NMR spectra were 
obtained for a series of Cp’,Th(CH3)X complexes (Figure 7). The

respectively (see Table I for full assignment of spectra). As the

shifts to higher field. 
Discussion 
Viewed in concert with our complementary surface chemical 
data,’ the present study illustrates the type of adsorbate-support 
structural information that can be acquired with I3C CPMAS 
NMR. Interestingly, the 27Al 
quadrupolar perturbations prove 
to be an asset rather than a liability in probing the metal al- 
kyl-A1203 interactions. 
Perhaps the most striking and broadly implicative observation 
comes from studies of Cp’,Th(13CH3),/DA. A new, broad res- 
onance is observed at -20 ppm (Figure 1D) in addition to the 
expected Cp’ and Th-I3CH3 signals. This upfield peak is com- 
pletely reproducible, appearing in the spectra of five independent, 
but similarly prepared, samples of this system. On the basis of 
the Cp’,Th(CH,), (natural abundance), Cp’,Th(I3CH3), (99% 
I3C), and [Cp’,Th(p-H)H], experiments, this feature is clearly 
assignable to a methyl group. The chemical shift, line shape, the 
field dependence of the line shape and the dipolar dephasing 
experiments lead us to propose that it arises from the transfer of 
a methyl functionality from Th to an A13+ 
site (presumably co- 
ordinatively unsaturated) on the DA surface. This contention is 
strongly supported by the results with model compounds having 
,’Al-CH, functionalities. The solid-state I3C NMR spectra of 
poly(methyla1uminoxanes) (at 15.0 MHz) exhibit a broad reso- 
nance at -17 to -20 ppm which essentially reproduces the line 
width and line shape of the broad, upfield peak in the Cp’,Th- 
(I3CH3),/DA system. The resonance for [(CH3)A1C1,], occurs 
at -9 ppm in the solid-state I3C spectrum (Figure 6B) while the 
spectrum of [(CH3)3A1]2 
in solution displays a peak at -8 ppm 
assigned to the terminal CH3 
As noted previously (under 
Results) the line width of the proposed A1-CH, resonance is 
attributable to 27Al-13C 
quadrupolar coupling effects which are 
not averaged by MAS at low magnetic field strengths. Thus, in 
the present study, the low magnetic field was a distinct advantage,

since it allowed the detection of the A1-CH, interaction. This 
result is the first persuasive evidence that alkyl groups from a 
precatalyst molecule (in this case, Cp’,Th(CH,),) can be trans- 
ferred to the constituent metal ions ( A P )  
of a metal oxide support. 
Several structures (e.g., A-D) may be proposed to account for

the I3C 
NMR spectrum of the Cp’,Th(I3CH,),/DA system, which 
appears to be the predominant surface organometallic species on 
DA. As regards bridging Th(p-CH,)Al interactions (e&, D), 
the present -20 ppm chemical shift is at considerably higher field 
than bridging methyl groups in Cp2M(p-CH3),AI(CH3)2 
com- 
pound~,~ 
where 
20.7, Sterminal 
-6.3 (M = Sc) and Bbridge 7.9, 
Gterminal -7.9 (M = Y ) .  
On the other hand, the bridging methyl 
resonance in [A1(CH3),I2 
is reported at -5.6 ~ p m . , ~  
Thus, while 
the great balance of the model compound data (aluminoxane, 
aluminum alkyl, C~,M(W-CH~),A~(CH,)~) 
argues for a terminal 
AI-CH, assignment in Cp2(Th(I3CH,),/DA, a bridging or par- 
tially bridging (but freely rotating) Th(pCH3)A1 
interaction 
cannot be rigorously excluded. 
As drawn, structures A-C can be viewed as canonical valence 
bond resonance structures. It can be argued, however, that the 
interaction of a surface Lewis base (oxygen) site on the DA with 
the organothorium fragment is probably weak (as in B) or non- 
existent (as in A) rather than strong (as in C) on the basis of the 
Th-CH3 chemical shift in the Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/DA 
I3C NMR 
spectrum (71.0 ppm). The corresponding shifts in a series of 
Cp’,Th(CH,)X complexes (vide supra) clearly show that oxygen 
a-donors displace this resonance to higher fields relative to the 
Th-CH, shift in neat solid Cp’,Th(CH,),. 
In the Cpf2Th- 
( 
13CH,),/PDA system, where a strong Th-0-A1 interaction 
appears likely (vide infra), the Th-CH, shift occurs at 66.3 ppm. 
In summary, the major surface reaction in the Cp’,Th- 
(I3CH3),/DA system appears to involve a transfer of a methyl 
group from Th to Al. The experimental NMR evidence implicates 
significant or complete transfer and the formation of an Al-CH, 
functionality. The remaining organothorium fragment may be 
anchored to the surface via a Th-0 interaction, but evidence for 
this is only circumstantial. 
Several experiments were also performed to study the molecular 
and conformational dynamics of the Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/DA 
system, 
including 
turning off the decoupler during data acquisition, 
varying 
cross-polarization 
time, and carrying out a Bloch decay experiment. 
All data (see Results) are consistent with organometallic species 
which are relatively immobile on the alumina surface. That the 
bound organometallics cannot be extracted from the surface with 
noncoordinating hydrocarbon solvents is in accord with this 
spectroscopic result. In addition, an interrupted decoupling ex- 
periment strongly suggests that the three upfield resonances (at 
ca. 71, 10, and -20 ppm) in the Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/DA 
I3C 
CPMAS 
NMR spectrum are assignable to freely rotating CH, groups while 
the peak at 124 ppm is due to the nonprotonated ring carbon 
atoms. 
In the case of the Cp’,Th(I3CH3),/PDA system, where the 
support has a far higher surface O H  coverage, considerably 
different solid-state I3C 
NMR results are obtained than with DA 
supports. The Th-13CH3 
resonance is weaker and broader for 
Cp’,Th(I3CH3),/PDA than for the DA case and is shifted upfield 
by almost 5 ppm (in the same direction as for Cp’,Th(CH,)X, 
where X = oxygen a-donor ligand). Little or no evidence for 
an Al-CH, interaction is present. The above observations suggest 
that aluminoxy structures such as E and/or F represent the major 
surface species for Cp’,Th(I3CH3),/PDA.

The present spectroscopic observations are in good accord with 
and significantly 
complement the surface chemical resu1ts.l Thus, 
the latter indicate that on DA up to He,25’,1, Cp’,Th(CH3)2 
methane evolution represents only ca. 9% of the available methyl 
groups. From deuterium labeling experiments, products such as 
E and F, G, and H comprise 
only ca. 6%, 2%, and 6%, respectively, 
H 
of the surface species produced up to He,25”,1 on DA.’ It is no 
surprise then that such surface complexes are not observed in the 
CPMAS NMR experiments (the alkylidene carbon resonance of 
G should occur at a characteristic low-field p o s i t i ~ n ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ) .  
The 
surface chemical studies do not, however, provide an obvious 
insight into the forces that bind Cp’,Th(CH,), to DA nor into 
the inertness of many (ca. 65-70%) of the adsorbate Th-CH, 
linkages to hydrogenolysis at 100 “ C  
(Cp’,Th(CH,), is very re- 
active in homogeneous solutionis). The latter characteristic is 
additionally 
confirmed by NMR-samples of Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/DA 
heated for several hours at 100 “C 
under H, give CPMAS spectra 
identical with the starting material, with no major diminution of 
the Th-I3CH3 signal. The identification of species such as A-D 
by NMR rationalizes both the molecule-DA binding forces as 
well as the low reactivity of the major adsorbate toward hydro- 
genolysis. In regard to the latter issue, saturated methyl alu- 
minates are expected to be relatively unreactivea while saturated, 
p-donor ligated thorium fragments such as B or C are also likely 
to resist hydrogenolysis (alkoxy substitution greatly retards or- 
ganoactinide hydrogenolysis in homogeneous solutionis). It is 
furthermore conceivable that some surface coordination sites will 
sterically shield the adsorbed Cp‘2Th(CH,)2 molecules from hy- 
drogenolysis. 
On PDA up to He,25’,1, ca. 65% of the available methane is 
ev~lved.l-~~ 
The labeling experiments indicate that ca. >5 1%,42 
2%, and 8% of the surface species are present as structure types 
E and F, G, and H, respectively. These data correlate well with 
the NMR results, which evidence a pronounced diminution of the 
Th-13CH3 resonance intensity relative to the Cp’ signals and a 
displacement of this resonance in the direction characteristic of 
Cp’,Th(CH3)0R complexes. Again, species G and H are in too 
low an abundance to be observed. In accord with the surface 
chemical data and the previous discussion, species such as E should 
resist hydrogenolysis. The CPMAS results suggest that on PDA, 
structures A-D do not play a major role.

The present 13C 
CPMAS investigation provides an important 
complement to the surface chemical results' in delineating ad- 
sorbate-alumina interactions for a highly active heterogeneous 
organoactinide catalyst. While the chemical results provide ev- 
idence for structures such as E-H, the surface N M R  studies 
strengthen this formulation and, moreover, indicate that transfer 
of methyl groups from the actinide to surface aluminum sites has 
also occurred. To 
our knowledge, the latter result represents the 
first direct observation of this type of process for a supported 
catalyst. It is likely that such chemistry is not restricted to 
organoactinides and that similar processes not only occur but are 
important in numerous other catalytic systems comprised of 
relatively polar metal alkyls and high surface area metal 0xides.4~"

Abstract: With a view to obtaining information of the structures and stabilities of the Cu(I1) complexes of tyrosine (Tyr)-containing 
dipeptides, spectroscopic and potentiometric studies have been carried out with the peptides to L-TyraX, where X refers to 
L-/D-alanine, -arginine, -Tyr, -tryptophan (Trp), -histidine (His), L-phenylalanine (Phe) , 
L-/D-glutamic acid. The complex 
species and their stability constants have been determined by potentiometric titrations at 25 O C  and I = 0.1 (KN03). All 
the peptides react with Cu(I1) in the manner analogous to L-tyrosylglycine (L-TYPG~Y), 
but the deprotonation of the peptide 
NH group is affected by the C-terminal side-chain groups. The dipeptides except L-Tyr-L-/D-His form at pH 8-1 1 a dimeric 
species, the maximum distribution of which occurs at pH -9.5 in the 1:l Cu(I1)-peptide systems with the dimer accounting 
for as much as 80% of the total Cu(I1) in 5 mM Cu(II)-L-Tyr.L-Trp. The constants for 2(monomer) F= dimer equilibria are 
in the range 2.04-3.70 log units. The absorption spectra of the 1:l systems (-2 mM) exhibit a d-d peak at 610-630 nm 
(c 9C-150) at pH >6 and in the presence of the dimeric complex an additional peak at -380 nm (c 26C-720), whose assignment 
to the charge transfer between Cu(I1) and the phenolate group has been confirmed by the resonance Raman spectra of the 
isolated complexes, [

5H20. While the circular dichroism (CD) spectral 
magnitudes in the d-d region for the Cu(II)-dipeptide complexes with a C-terminal aliphatic amino acid are an additive function 
of those exhibited by the component amino acid complexes irrespective of the diastereoisomerism of the peptides, remarkable 
CD magnitude anomaly was observed for the active (L-L) peptides with a C-terminal aromatic amino acid, 1.-TyreL-X 
(X = 
Tyr, Trp, and Phe). The anomaly is diastereospecific and strictly coincident with the dimer formation, 
which is taken to imply 
distortion by the dimeric structure of the C-terminal side-chain orientation favoring the Cu(I1)-aromatic ring interaction. 
Tyrosine constitutes the N-terminus of endogenous analgesic 
peptides such as enkephalin' and endorphin2 
isolated from brain 
and is considered to be essential for their a~tivity.~ 
An analgesic 
dipeptide, L-tyrosyl-L-arginine (kyotorphin), 
was later isolated from
