A quantumchemical study of alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis on silicasupported
Group VB metal hydrides (M = V, Nb, Ta) was carried out. Using a model fragment with the
βcrystobalite structure permits a correct description of the properties of the grafted organome
tallic complexes. Alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis reactions involve (i) πcomplexes and
carbene complexes of MV and (ii) alkyl derivatives of MIII as possible intermediates. The
character of the potential energy surfaces of the key alkane transformations points to an
important role of triplet states in the catalytic processes involving niobium and vanadium. An
alternative lowenergy reaction pathway characterized by a change in the spin state was found.
Key words: activation of alkanes, hydrogenolysis of alkanes, metathesis of alkanes, surface
metal complexes, Group VB metal hydrides, quantumchemical calculations, ab initio quan
tumchemical calculations.
Activation of alkanes remains one of the most impor
tant problems in catalytic chemistry. C—C and C—H
bond activation in the presence of conventional oxide
and bifunctional catalysts proceeds only at temperatures
above 300 °C, which requires enormous energy expendi
ture and enhances side reactions.1
Recently, silicasupported transitionmetal (Ta, Ti,
Zr) hydrides have attracted the attention of researchers.2
These compounds are synthesized in the reactions of cor
responding organometallic compounds with partially
dehydroxylated silica followed by reduction of the surface
complexes thus formed. Such catalysts can activate the
C—C and C—H bonds under mild conditions under which
conventional catalysts are inactive.3,4 In particular, sup
ported tantalum hydride is active in the alkane hydro
genolysis and metathesis reactions (Scheme 1). It is be
lieved5,6 that the role of the active sites is played by tanta
lum monohydride and the key stage of transformations is
a σbond metathesis involving an intramolecular hydro
gen exchange when the coordination number of the metal
atom remains unchanged. The reaction involves the C—C
and C—H bond cleavage. Hydrogenolysis proceeds at a
rather high rate and is followed by the formation of lower
homologs up to methane; metathesis proceeds at a very
low rate and is followed by the formation of the higher
and lower homologs.
Activation of various alkanes on surface zirconium
hydrides has been studied in detail;7,8 however, informa
tion on the structure of active sites and on the mecha
nisms of reactions involving Group VB metals in unavail
able. It is still unclear how the nature of the metal affects
the course of these transformations. Obtaining such in
formation is important for target development of new
catalysts for alkane activation.
The aim of this work was to carry out a quantum
chemical study of the possibility of alkane activation on
silicasupported Group VB metal hydrides (M = V, Nb,
Ta) and to determine the structure of possible active sites
and the mechanisms of alkane hydrogenolysis and met
athesis reactions. This required investigations into the
structure of intermediates and transition states (TS) of the
key stages in the catalytic cycle of alkane hydrogenolysis
and metathesis in the ground and lowest excited elec
tronic states and the establishment of how the nature of
the metal affects the behavior of the catalytic system.
Calculation Procedure
Calculations were carried out by the density functional theory
(DFT) with the B3LYP exchangecorrelation functional as well
as by the multiconfiguration selfconsistent field (MCSCF) ap
proach. In the latter case, a complete active space (CASSCF)

version9 with inclusion of dynamic electron correlation at the
secondorder level of perturbation theory (MRMP2)10 was em
ployed. To reduce the computing time, the SBK pseudo
potential11,12 and the corresponding basis set augmented with
polarization functions on all atoms were used in all calculations.
The calculations were performed with full geometry optimiza
tion, unless otherwise specified. The nature of all stationary
points was substantiated by analyzing the Hessians. In addition,
for all transition states the reaction pathway was analyzed by the
intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method.13 All calculations
were carried out using the GAMESS US program package.14
The results of calculations were visualized using the MOLDEN 15
and ChemCraft* programs.
Results and Discussion
Structure of active sites. The modified silica surface
was modeled by the cluster (H4Si2O5)(OH)2 representing
a fragment of SiO2 βcrystobalite structure16 in which the
broken bonds are saturated with hydroxyl groups whose
geometric parameters were fixed in the B3LYP/SBK(d,p)
calculations (Fig. 1, a). Earlier,17 it was shown that en
largement of the cluster has almost no effect on the struc
ture of the surface fragment.
Preliminary calculations of the oxidative addition of
ethane to tantalum monohydride showed that the cata
lytic cycles of alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis on
tantalum monohydride are unlikely.17 Tantalum trihydride
was suggested as a possible structure of active sites. The
B3LYP/SBK(d,p) optimized structure of the cluster mod
eling silicasupported tantalum trihydride is shown in
Fig. 1, b. The Ta—O bond lengths calculated for tantalum
trihydride and tantalum monohydride are in good agree
ment with experimental data (Table 1). IR band frequen
cies are in much better agreement with the assumption of
formation of silicasupported tantalum trihydride charac
terized by three normal vibrations corresponding to Ta—H
stretching vibrations (two symmetrical and one anti
symmetrical modes). The calculated stretching vibration
frequencies of TaH3 (Table 2) are in good agreement with
experimental data.18
Multiconfiguration approach. Analysis of the TS and
intermediates in the ground and excited electronic states
requires the use of the wave functions that include a num
ber of different electronic configurations. In this connec
tion, possible key stages of the catalytic cycles of alkane
hydrogenolysis and metathesis, namely, alkane C—H
bond activation; a proton (or alkyl) transfer in the metal
carbene to give a complex of the trivalent metal; and
dihydrogen addition at the double bond of the metal
carbene (Scheme 2) were studied by the CASSCF method,
because the CASSCF wave function includes all possible
configurations corresponding to all possible combinations

Significance of additional configurations can be evalu
ated with ease in diagonalization of the firstorder density
matrix for the CASSCF wave function. If a system is
correctly described by the Hartree—Fock method, the
eigenvalues of the density matrix will approach a value of
two for the bonding orbitals and zero for the antibonding
orbitals. The stronger the multideterminant character of
the wave function, the higher the populations of the
antibonding orbitals. Correspondingly, the bonding or
bital populations decrease.19
The nature of chemical bonding in transitionmetal
complexes can be analyzed and interrelations between
complex ab initio calculations and a simple valence bond
approach revealed using the MCSCF/LMO/CI scheme.20
The approach includes construction of the CASSCF wave
function, derivation of MOs localized on atoms to the
greatest extent, and construction of the CI wave function
with the active space including the localized orbitals. As a
result, one obtains (i) contributions of each structure to
the wave function of the system and (ii) configurations
similar to resonance structures.
Structure of complexes H—[M]s=CH2 ([M]s =
(≡
≡

≡
≡SiO)2M). To describe the structure of metal carbene
H—[M]s=CH2 and proton transfer in this system, one
must use the active space including six orbitals occupied
by six electrons (CAS(6,6) active space). In this case, the
singletstate wave function includes a total of 175 con
figurations. Correspondingly, it is possible to obtain a
total of 175 resonance structures in order to describe such
a metal carbene. In spite of the variety of structures,
chemical bonding in the system is still quite easy to de
scribe because only the structures with twocenter two
electron bonds make the largest contributions. The
CASSCF(6,6)optimized structures of the metal carbenes
H—[M]s=CH2 (M = V, Nb, Ta) are shown in Fig. 2. The
geometric parameters of the tantalum and niobium com
plexes are similar, whereas in the vanadium complex the
M—O, M—H and M=C bonds are 0.1 Å shorter and the
C—M—H bond angle is 5° smaller. The limiting case of
applicability of the Hartree—Fock wave function is char
acterized by the absence of mixing of configurations. This
means that the wave function has no biradical character
and the natural orbital populations of the bonding σ and

πMOs exactly equal two while those of the antibonding
σ* and π*MOs equal zero. As the biradical character of
the wave function increases, the bonding orbital popula
tions decrease while the antibonding orbital populations
increase. For a "pure" πbiradical, the bonding πorbital
and the antibonding π*orbital populations equal unity.
The natural orbitals of the complexes H—[M]s=CH2 are
schematically shown in Fig. 3 and their populations are
listed in Table 3. The biradical character of the wave
function increases in the order Ta < Nb < V and becomes
so high for the vanadium complex that the system can no
longer be described by the B3LYP method due to diver
gence of the selfconsistency procedure. At the same time
the geometric parameters of the niobium and tantalum
complexes obtained from CASSCF and B3LYP calcula
tions differ only slightly (by at most 0.04 Å). Since the
biradical character implies a high reactivity, the kinetic
stability of the systems increases in the order V < Nb < Ta.
A correct description of these structures requires the use
of the MCSCF wave function, because the antibonding
orbital populations become large, especially in the case of
vanadium (nπ* = 0.19).
In order to apply the MCSCF/LMO/CI scheme of
analysis, localization of the σ and πorbitals according to
Ruedenberg21 was performed separately (Fig. 4). This al
lowed us to avoid formation of "banana" bonds.
The resonance structures making the major contribu
tion to the wave function of the whole system are listed in
Table 4. The contributions of the structures with orbitals
occupied by 0, 1, 3, and 4 electrons are negligible. The
resonance structures with the carbon atom acting as

σdonor are much more important than the structures in
which this atom plays the role of σacceptor. Donation
from the πMCorbital of the metal atom to the πCMorbital
of the carbon atom contributes largely to πbonding. Neu
tral and nucleophilic structures dominate over electro
philic ones. The greatest contributions to the wave func
tions of the complexes H—[M]s=CH2 come from the
covalent and σdonor structures.
The CASSCF(6,6)optimized structures of triplet
metal carbenes H—[M]s=CH2 (M = Nb, Ta) are shown
in Fig. 5. In this case the CASSCF wave function in
cludes a total of 189 configurations. T←SExcitation
causes elongation of the M=C bond by 0.18 Å and rota
tion of the =CH2 top by 37 (Ta) and 18° (Nb). No mini
mum corresponding to triplet vanadium complex was lo
cated on the potential energy surface (PES). T←SExci
tation of carbene H—[V]s=CH2 leads to its relaxation
immediately into the trivalent vanadium com
pound [V]s—Me.
The tripletstate wave function has a much lower
biradical character. In the triplet state, there are two
equivalent natural orbitals, π1 and π2, with unity popula
tions (Table 5) instead of the bonding (π) and antibonding
(π*) natural orbitals typical of the singlet state. Analysis of
the CI wave function composed of the localized orbitals
revealed a 99.8% contribution made by nine resonance
structures (Table 6). Similarly to the singlet state, the
resonance structures in which the carbon atom acts as σ
donor are much more important than the structures with
the carbon atom acting as σacceptor. Neutral and nu
cleophilic structures dominate over electrophilic ones and
the largest contributions to the wave function comes from
the covalent and σdonor structures.
The MRMP2 calculated T←Sexcitation energies
(π—π*transition) of the H—[M]s=CH2 complexes are
44 (M = Ta) and 38 kcal mol–1 (M = Nb).
Structure of complexes [M]s—Me. The molecular and
electronic structures of the singlet complexes [M]s—Me
(M = V, Nb, Ta) are shown in Fig. 6 and in Table 7. The
MCSCF and B3LYP calculated geometric parameters of
the complexes are similar, except for the M—C bond
length. The B3LYP method underestimates this param
eter by 0.05 Å compared to the MCSCF scheme.
For all complexes, the major contribution (95%) to
the total wave function is made by only three resonance
structures with two electrons occupying the n1 orbital.
These are the covalent structure :M—Me (55%), the
σdonor structure :M←Me (30%), and the σacceptor

structure :M→Me (10%) (Fig. 7). Neutral and nucleo
philic structures dominate over electrophilic ones; their
contribution to the total wave function is nearly the same
as in the case of the H—[M]s=CH2 complexes.
A feature of the molecular structure of the [M]s—Me
(M = V, Nb, Ta) complexes in the lowest singlet state is
nonplanar structure of the OM(C)O fragment, which was
not found in the Hartree—Fock calculations. This can be
due to a small (1—2%) contribution of the :M—Me reso
nance structure with two electrons occupying the n2 or
bital to the total wave function of the system. We can
suggest that deviation of the methyl fragment from the
O—M—O plane by 10 (M = Ta), 16 (M = Nb), and 5°
(M = V) is caused by repulsion between two electrons in

the triplet complexes [M]s—Me are shown in Fig. 8 and
in Table 8. As in the singletstate calculations, the MCSCF
and B3LYP calculated geometric parameters of the com
plexes are similar, except for the M—C bond length (the
results obtained differ by 0.06—0.08 Å). T←SExcitation
causes elongation of the M—C bond by 0.05—0.07 Å.
For all complexes, the major contribution (99.5%) to
the total wave function make three resonance structures
with the n1 and n2 orbitals occupied by one electron each.
These are the covalent structure M—Me (60%), the
σdonor structure M←Me (25%), and the σacceptor
structure M→Me (15%) (Fig. 9). As to the vanadium
complex, the contribution of the σdonor structure in
creases to 30% and that of the σacceptor structure de
creases to 10%.
The MRMP2 calculated T←Sexcitation energy of
the [Ta]s—Me complex is 5.5 kcal mol–1. The niobium
and vanadium complexes are characterized by the re
versed order of electronic energy levels, with the triplet

lated singlettriplet splittings are 9 (M = Nb) and

TS of these reactions calculated for the lowest and first
excited electronic states are shown in Fig. 10 and listed in
Table 9, respectively.
The key role in proton transfer to nucleophilic C atom
of metal carbene H—[M]s=CH2 is played by the interac
tion of the unoccupied σ*orbital of the M—H bond with
the occupied πorbital of the M=C bond. This is the so
called electron density back donation from the πorbital
of the M=C bond to the σ*orbital of the M—H bond.
The singlet and triplet tantalum complexes are char
acterized by activation barriers of 25 and 12 kcal mol–1,
respectively. The reaction involving the singlet complex is
endothermic (∆E = 17 kcal mol–1) while the reac
tion involving the triplet complex is exothermic (∆E =
–23 kcal mol–1). As a result, the separation between
the singlet and triplet PESs reduces to 5 kcal mol–1
(Fig. 11, a).
A comparison of the potential energy profiles obtained
for the singlet (S) and triplet (T) states revealed an impor
tant structural feature of the TS. The structure of the
triplet TS is similar to the reactant structure while the
structure of the singlet TS is more similar to the structure

niobium and tantalum complexes are characterized by
similar activation barriers (23 and 9 kcal mol–1 for the
singlet and triplet states, respectively), the energies of the
reaction being 18 kcal mol–1 for the singlet PES and
–28 kcal mol–1 for the triplet PES. The singlettriplet
splitting for H—[Nb]s=CH2 is 6 kcal mol–1 smaller than
for H—[Ta]s=CH2. Because of this, in the former case
the singlet and triplet PESs can cross before the barrier
is reached (Fig. 11, b). The reaction pathway can pass
through the PES crossing point rather than the singlet
transition state 1TS. This can be accompanied by a multi
plicity change and formation of a triplet complex
[Nb]s—Me characterized by a singlettriplet splitting of
9 kcal mol–1. The transition probability between two PESs
can roughly be estimated using the Landau—Zener rela
tion.22 This pathway leads to a decrease in the effective
activation energy.
A similar picture was established for vanadium com
plexes, although no minimum corresponding to the
H—[V]s=CH2 complex was located on the PES of the
triplet state. In the singlet state, the activation barrier and
the energy of reaction decrease to 12 and 6 kcal mol–1,
respectively, and the singlettriplet splitting for the
[V]s—Me complex increases to 20 kcal mol–1 (Fig. 11, c).
Thus, our calculations show that the stability of the
tantalum complexes increases from the triplet complex of
TaIII to the singlet complex of TaV. As to niobium and
vanadium, the triplet complex of NbIII occupies an inter
mediate position and the triplet complex of VIII appears to
be the most stable form (Fig. 12).

of the product reaction (see Table 9). This difference can
play a significant role when considering the reactivity of
the niobium and vanadium complexes. For instance, the

slightly from 15 to 19 kcal mol–1 and the heats of reac
tions decrease from 12 to 7 kcal mol–1 (exothermic reac
tion) in order Ta, Nb, V.
Although proton addition at the M=C bond requires a
small energy expenditure, activation of C—H bonds in
alkanes in the reactions with H—[M]s=CH2 complexes
is a much more difficult process. For instance, the
B3LYP/SBK(d,p) calculated activation barrier to alkane
addition at the Ta=C bond, resulting in the formation of
C—H and Ta—C bonds, is 28 kcal mol–1, being nearly
four times higher than the energy needed for proton addi
tion to occur. The interaction between the alkane C—H
bond and the M=C bond is governed by the electron
density donation from the σCHorbital of the C—H bond
to the π*MCorbital of the M=C bond and by the electron
density back donation from the πMCorbital of the M=C
bond to the σ*CHorbital of the C—H bond. Owing to
steric hindrances the alkane molecule is η3coordinated
to the metal atom. The M—H—C angle is much larger
than it is necessary for efficient orbital overlap to occur
and the activation energy for C—C bond formation ex
ceeds 50 kcal mol–1.
Catalytic cycles of ethane hydrogenolysis. The section
of the PES of ethane hydrogenolysis on tantalum tri
hydride (1a)23 (Scheme 3) is shown in Fig. 15. The pro
cess begins with C—H bond metathesis and formation of
ethyl dihydride complex 2a. Elimination of a proton re
sults in metal carbenes 3a; proton transfer in them leads
to formation of a tantalum(III) complex 4a. Subsequent
C—C bond cleavage and Me shift to Ta result in a Schrock
carbene 5a. Further interaction between a proton and the
Schrock complex leads to dimethyl hydride complex 6a.

Activation of alkanes on metal hydrides
Russ.Chem.Bull., Int.Ed., Vol. 54, No. 2, February, 2005

The last two stages (6a → 7a and 7a → 1a), by analogy
with the first stage, represent a σbond metathesis and
involve regeneration of tantalum trihydride and elimina
tion of methane. Relatively low activation barriers suggest
that the catalytic cycle of ethane hydrogenolysis can be
realized at relatively low temperatures. Indeed, experi
ments showed that the reaction does occur at 150 °C.6
Nearly identical picture was also established for the
catalyst based on niobium trihydride (1b). However, the
activation energy for the formation of methylcarbene com
plex decreases due to crossing of the triplet and singlet
PESs and emergence of a new lowenergy, highspin re
action pathway. It passes across the singlet PES until the
crossing point of the triplet and singlet PESs, goes to the
triplet PES, passes through the point corresponding to the
triplet state of the ethyl complex 4b, and again returns to
the singlet PES (Fig. 16).
As mentioned above, the most stable vanadium com
pound is the vanadium(III) complex. In this case the sin
glet and triplet PESs also cross each other but, in contrast
to the reaction involving the niobium complexes, ethane
hydrogenolysis begins with C—H bond metathesis in the
reaction of ethane with triplet vanadium monohydride
resulting in the ethyl complex of vanadium monohydride.
Then, the reaction pathway passes through the crossing
point of the singlet and triplet PESs corresponding to a
Fig. 15. B3LYP/SBK(d,p)calculated PES section of ethane
hydrogenolysis on tantalum trihydride (1a). The structures of

singlet carbene complex. Further interaction of this com
plex with hydrogen on the singlet PES results in a dim
ethyl hydride complex. Then, the reaction pathway passes
through the second PES crossing point, the multiplicity
changes again, and a methyl complex of trivalent vana
dium in the triplet state and methane are formed. The
cycle is completed with a process similar to the first stage,
which involves regeneration of vanadium(III) mono
hydride and elimination of yet another methane molecule
(Fig. 17).
The catalytic cycle of alkane hydrogenolysis on silica
supported metal hydrides can be used to explain the met
athesis of alkanes. A salient feature of the metathesis
mechanism is that it permits formation of intermediate
alkyl complexes in which the metal atom is bonded to the
alkyl fragment through primary or secondary carbon at
oms. This provides an explanation for the formation of
isomeric alkanes (Scheme 4).
Compared to hydrogenolysis of alkanes, metathesis of
these compounds is by and large both thermally and ki
netically unfavorable. Such a reaction cannot proceed at
rather high rates even at low partial pressures of hydrogen
when almost no hydrogenolysis is observed, so it should
be considered only as a side reaction accompanying
hydrogenolysis of alkanes.
Thus, our calculations showed that possible interme
diates of alkane hydrogenolysis and metathesis on silica
supported Group VB metal hydrides are (i) πcomplexes
and carbene complexes of MV and (ii) alkyl derivatives
of MIII. We analyzed peculiarities of the electronic struc
ture of the grafted complexes of Group VB metals and
showed that the biradical character of the wave function
increases in order Ta < Nb < V. A correct description of
the systems based on the vanadium complexes requires
the use of the multiconfiguration approach. Based on
analysis of the PES structure of the key transformations
of alkanes, a possible role of triplet states in the catalytic
processes involving the niobium and vanadium com
plexes was pointed out and an alternative lowenergy path
way characterized by the change in the spin state was
found.
