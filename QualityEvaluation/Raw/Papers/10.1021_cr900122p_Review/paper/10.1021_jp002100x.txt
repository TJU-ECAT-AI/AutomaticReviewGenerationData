Abstract
Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts. Competitive reactions of C3H6 and CH313CH2CH3 showed that propene is the most abundant primary product, and that CO and CO2 are formed via either secondary combustion of propene, or by direct combustion of propane. A mixture of C3H8 and C3D8 undergoes oxidative dehydrogenation without forming C3H8-xDx mixed isotopomers, suggesting that steps involving C−H bond activation are irreversible. Normal kinetic isotopic effects (kC-H/kC-D) were measured for propane dehydrogenation (2.3), propane combustion (1.6) and propene combustion (2.1). These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of C−H bonds in the respective reactant. H−D exchange occurs readily between C3H6 and D2O or C3D6 and H2O, suggesting that OH recombination steps are reversible and quasi-equilibrated. Reactions of 18O2/C3H8 on supported Mo16Ox species lead to the preferential initial appearance of lattice 16O atoms in H2O, CO, and CO2, indicating that lattice oxygen is required for C−H bond activation and for the ultimate oxidation of the adsorbed products of this reaction. 18O16O was not detected during reactions of C3H8−18O2−16O2 mixtures, consistent with irreversible O2 dissociation steps. These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars−van Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of C−H bond in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining O−H group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers. The reduced Mo centers finally reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The proposed reaction mechanism leads to a complex kinetic rate expression that accurately describes the observed dependences on the partial pressure of propane, oxygen, and water.

Introduction
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has been investigated as a potential route to propene. 1-7 Extensive evaluations of catalyst compositions have shown that the most active and selective ones contain V or Mo oxides as the active component.3 Over these catalysts, it has been proposed that the oxidation of propane occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1).3
Scheme 1:  Reaction Network for the Propane Oxidation Reactions
Propene is the primary product and carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts via propane and propene combustion. Several studies have addressed the primary and secondary reactions occurring during propane ODH, 8-15 but only a few of them have provided descriptions of the elementary steps involved or evaluations of the rate coefficients for the elementary steps. By analogy with other oxidation reactions, propane ODH has been proposed to proceed via a Mars−van Krevelen mechanism,9,12-15 in which propane reacts with lattice oxygen in the catalyst and the resulting vacancies then react by dissociative adsorption of O2. This mechanistic interpretation has been based largely on agreement between proposed sequences of elementary steps and experimental reaction kinetics. Only limited independent evidence for specific elementary steps has been reported.13 Although kinetic rate expressions for oxidative dehydrogenation and combustion pathways can provide a basis for developing mechanistic inferences, they are insufficient to establish the identity and reversibility of individual elementary steps. Isotopic tracer studies, however, can discriminate among various mechanistic proposals that may describe with similar accuracy the measured rate expressions. Such studies can also confirm the assumptions required in order to obtain a given rate expression from a sequence of elementary steps. 15,16
Vanadium-based catalysts have been widely studied as selective oxidation catalysts.3 Reaction mechanisms and detailed elementary steps for propane ODH on VOx species have been proposed, and the reversibility of proposed elementary steps has been confirmed by isotopic tracer studies.15 Molybdenum-based catalysts have also been widely studied, but less thoroughly than vanadium-based catalysts, because of their lower ODH reaction rates.3 Some Mo-based catalysts, however, show very high propene selectivity.3,4 Only a few studies have addressed the mechanism for alkane ODH reactions on Mo-based catalysts but, to our knowledge, the detailed elementary steps have not been examined using isotopic methods or detailed kinetic studies of the individual primary and secondary reactions involved.13,14
The structure and propane ODH properties of molybdate species supported on ZrO2 have been recently reported.4 The structure of MoOx species on ZrO2 depends on the MoOx surface density and on the temperature of thermal treatments. For Mo surface densities below 5 Mo/nm2, two-dimensional MoOx oligomers form on ZrO2 surfaces, irrespective of treatment temperature. For higher MoOx surface densities, treatment at low temperatures (∼673 K) leads to the formation of MoO3 crystallites, while treatment at high temperatures (∼873 K) causes the formation of ZrMo2O8 crystallites. Propane ODH turnover rate are widely different on MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 because of apparent differences in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds. On both structures, the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the combustion of propene is significantly higher than for propane ODH.4
The objective of this study is to determine the identity and reversibility of elementary steps involved in propane ODH on Mo-based catalysts and to infer the nature of the active surface species required to catalyze the rate-determining elementary steps. Isotopic tracer methods are combined with measurements of the concentration dependence for each reaction in Scheme 1. Most of the reported results were obtained on a MoOx/ZrO2 sample with a surface density of 3−4 Mo/nm2 and containing predominately two-dimensional MoOx oligomers as the active species. Rate expressions were also obtained on two other MoOx/ZrO2 samples containing predominately either MoO3 or ZrMo2O8 crystallites.
Experimental Section
Three MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were used in the present study. These samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of precipitated zirconium oxyhydroxide with an ammonium dimolybdate (99%, Aldrich, Inc.) solution, followed by drying and thermal treatment in dry air.4 One sample contained 11 wt % MoO3 and it was treated in air at 773 K. Structural characterization of this sample by X-ray diffraction and by X-ray absorption, Raman, and UV−visible spectroscopies indicated that Mo species exist predominantly as MoOx oligormers.4 The other two samples contain 37 wt % MoO3. One sample was treated in air at 673 K and the other at 873 K. After treatment at 673 K this sample contains predominately MoO3 crystallites, while treatment at 873 K leads to the preferential formation of crystalline ZrMo2O8 structures.4 Table 1 shows the structural properties and designation for each of the MoOx/ZrO2 samples used in this study.

Reaction rates were measured using a quartz microreactor containing 0.02−0.1 g samples.5 C3H8 and O2 conversions were varied by changing reactant flow rates between 0.8 and 3.5 cm3 s-1. C3H8 and O2 conversions were typically below 2% and 20%, respectively. Propane reaction rates were extrapolated to zero residence time in order to obtain initial dehydrogenation and combustion reaction, while propene combustion were obtained from the observed changes in propene selectivity with residence time.5 Water was introduced into the C3H8−O2 reactants by reacting a metered 20% H2/Ar side stream with CuO (150 g of CuO) at 623 K to form the desired amount of H2O. All transfer lines located down stream of the point of water introduction were kept above 393 K in order to prevent condensation.
All isotopic tracer studies were carried out in a gradientless batch reactor contained within a gas recirculation loop. 17 Reactants and products were recirculated at 3.3 cm3 s-1 using a graphite gear micropump in order to maintain low propane conversions per pass (<1%). The reactor was evacuated by mechanical and diffusion pumps isolated from the system by liquid nitrogen traps. The chemical and isotopic composition of reactants and products were measured by mass spectrometry after capillary gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard model 5972 GC-MS). The deuterium and carbon-13 contents in the products were determined from mass spectrometric data using matrix techniques that correct for ion fragmentation and natural 13C abundance. 18 Undeuterated propane (Matheson, instrument purity >99.5%), perdeuterated propane (Isotec, chemical purity >99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), 2-13C-propane (Cambridge Isotopes, chemical purity >98.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), propane-2,2-d2 (Isotec, chemical purity >99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%), 18O2 (Isotec, isotopic purity >99.0%), 16O2 (research grade, >99.999%), and propene (Matheson, C. P., >99.0%) were used as reactants without further purification. Perdeuterated water (D2O; Isotec, chemical purity >99.0%, isotopic purity >99.0%) and distilled water (H2O) were purified by several freeze−thaw evacuation cycles before use. Helium (research grade, >99.999%) was used as an inert diluent in all studies.
Results and Discussion
ReactionNetwork. Isotopic tracer and residence time studies have shown that propane reactions occur via a combination of parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1) on VOx-based catalysts.15 Similar reaction pathways are suggested by residence time effects on propene selectivity observed on MoOx/ZrO2 (Figure 1). Propene selectivity decreases with increasing contact time, as it converts to COx via secondary combustion pathways. Propene selectivities extrapolated to zero residence time are less than 100%, indicating that direct propane combustion reactions occur in parallel with ODH. Propene forms as the primary ODH product and COx forms via propene or propane combustion steps. The rates of propane and propene reactions in Scheme 1 can be determined from the 13C content in the products formed from mixtures of unlabeled propene and propane-2-13C.15,19-22 The 13C content in the reactants and products is shown in Figure 2 for reactions of propane-2-13C/propene/oxygen mixture on MoOx/ZrO2. The 13C fraction in propane remained at its initial value (0.33) throughout. Thus, the isotopic content in propane is not diluted by propene hydrogenation, as expected from the irreversible nature of the overall ODH reaction at the conditions of our study. The 13C fraction in propene increases with contact time, because propene-2-13C is gradually formed from propane-2-13C via dehydrogenation, at the same time as the propene isotopomers are consumed by combustion. The 13C fractions in CO and CO2 were very similar, suggesting that the CO2/CO selectivity ratios in primary propane combustion and secondary propene combustion were very similar. However, the 13C fraction in COx extrapolated to zero contact time is greater than 0, suggesting that COx forms via both propane and propene combustion reactions. The reaction rate constant ratio (k‘3/k‘2) for propene combustion (k‘3) to propane combustion (k‘2) can be calculated from the initial value of 13C in COx. The calculated k‘3/k‘2 value is 80 (based on the initial 13C fraction in COx). This value is very similar to the value of 87 calculated from the data in Figure 1 using the kinetic analysis procedures reported previously.4 Thus, these isotopic tracer results are consistent with the observed effects of reactor residence time on propene and COx selectivities,4,5,10-13 they confirm the parallel and sequential oxidation steps in ODH of propane over Mo-based catalysts.

Kinetic Dependence of Propane ODH Rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O Concentrations. The effects of varying the concentrations of C3H8, O2, and H2O on the initial rate of propene formation were determined. One kinetic rate expression was able to describe propane ODH rates on the three samples used in this study. This suggests that the elementary steps required for propane ODH reactions are similar on the surfaces of two-dimensional MoOx oligomers (MoOx/ZrO2), bulk MoO3 (MoO3/ZrO2), and bulk ZrMo2O8 (ZrMo2O8/ZrO2). Here, we show detailed data on MoOx/ZrO2. Figure 3 shows initial propene formation rates as a function of propane partial pressure at a given value of O2 partial pressure. Propene formation rates increased linearly with increasing propane partial pressure, in agreement with previous reports.11,13-15 Figure 4 shows that initial propene formation rates are independent of O2 partial pressure at a given propane partial pressure when H2O is not present in the C3H8/O2 feed, also in agreement with previous reports11-15 and suggesting a zero-order dependence on oxygen partial pressure. The effect of H2O partial pressure on initial propane ODH rates is shown in Figure 5 at constant C3H8 and O2 partial pressures. Water inhibits the rate of propane ODH, in a manner similar to that reported previously for propane and ethane ODH over V2O5-based catalysts. 15,23

Analysis of Elementary Steps. By analogy with our previous proposal on supported vanadia,15 the set of elementary steps below is used in order to describe the kinetic dependence of propene formation rates on O2, C3H8, and H2O for MoOx catalysts. Propane ODH can be proposed based on the obtained kinetic power law rate expressions.
1. Nondissociative adsorption of propane by interaction on a lattice oxygen (O*)
2. C−H bond activation by abstraction of H atom from adsorbed propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen atom
3. Desorption of propene by β-hydride elimination
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced Mo center (*)
5. Reoxidation of Mo centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2
In this scheme, O* is a lattice oxygen in MoO or Mo−O−Mo structures, OH* is a hydroxyl group in Mo−O−H, C3H7O* represents an adsorbed propoxide species bonded to a Mo cation through one of its O atoms (Mo−O−C3H7), and * represents a surface vacancy associated with either one Mo4+ or two Mo5+ cations in the MoOx lattice.
The assumption of pseudo-steady state for all reaction intermediates leads to a complex rate expression, which can be made simpler by additional assumptions about the reversibility of specific elementary steps. Step 1 involves weak nondissociative adsorption of propane; the small expected binding energy of molecularly adsorbed propane is likely to lead to rapid reversible adsorption−desorption and to quasi-equilibration during propane ODH. Step 2 is assumed to be irreversible based on the low C3H8−C3D8 isotopic scrambling rates during ODH (shown below). The recombination of OH groups is assumed to be reversible and quasi-equilibrated, based on the observed inhibition by H2O, which would not be possible if step 4 were irreversible, and on the results of C3H8−D2O exchange rate measurements during ODH reactions (shown below). O2 chemisorption is assumed to be irreversible based on the negligible rate of isotopic scrambling of 16O2−18O2 mixtures during ODH reactions (shown below). Both in situ X-ray absorption and UV−visible spectroscopy showed that MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts remain essentially oxidized state during propane ODH and that concentration of oxygen vacancies is very low. 24 The vacancy (*) concentration is likely to be much smaller than those of (O*) and (OH*) during propane ODH. These assumptions lead to the kinetic rate expression
in which ki is the rate coefficient and Ki is the equilibrium constant for reaction i. This equation predicts that the rate of propane ODH is first order in C3H8 concentration and zero order in the concentration of O2 at very low H2O concentrations. As the concentration of H2O increases, propane ODH rate decreases, and the apparent orders in C3H8 and O2 become smaller than unity and larger than zero, respectively. Figure 6 compares propane ODH rates predicted by this expression with rate data at various C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations. The estimated rate coefficients are different for the three molybdena catalysts of this study, because these coefficients depend on the dispersion of the Mo oxide species and on the number of accessible sites. The excellent agreement shown in Figure 6 for all three catalysts, however, confirms the mechanistic resemblance of propane ODH reactions on MoOx oligomers, bulk MoO3, and bulk ZrMo2O8. This is consistent with our previously proposed kinetic equivalence of MoOx species at polymolybdate and bulk MoO3 surfaces.4 Alternate elementary steps, including propane interactions with surface vacancies and irreversible OH recombination steps, did not lead to rate expressions in satisfactory agreement with experimental rates.

Irreversible Initial C−H Bond Activation in Propane. At very low H2O concentrations, the rate of propene formation depends linearly on C3H8 concentration, suggesting that propane activation is a kinetically relevant step. The reversibility of C−H bond activation steps can be probed by measuring the rate of H−D isotopic scrambling in “unreacted” propane during reactions of C3H8/C3D8−O2 mixtures.15 If the C−H bond activation is reversible, C3HxD8-x (0 < x < 8) isotopomers can form via the microscopic reverse of the C−H bond activation step.19,20 If C−H bond activation is irreversible, however, the formation of C3HxD8-x (0 < x <8) isotopomers will be much slower than propane conversion to propene and COx.15
Figure 7 shows the deuterium distribution in propane during the reaction of a C3H8/C3D8/O2 mixture over MoOx/ZrO2 at ∼4% propane conversion. At all propane conversions, only C3H8 and C3D8 were detected in the unreacted propane pool. No cross-exchange C3HxD8-x isotopomers were detected by mass spectrometry, suggesting that C−H bond activation is an irreversible step in the ODH reaction sequence. The isotopomer distributions were determined using deconvolution methods that neglect secondary kinetic isotope effects in the fragmentation process.18 This deconvolution procedure can lead to very small negative values of some isotopomer mole fractions (e.g., C3D7H in Figure 7). The mole fractions of all mixed propane isotopomers are zero within the accuracy of the measurements and the reliability of the deconvolution procedures. These conclusions are similar to those reached for propane ODH reactions on VOx/ZrO2.15

The kinetic relevance of C−H (and C−D) bond dissociation steps can also be inferred from the effect of deuterium substitution on the rate of propene and COx formation. The reaction rate constants for ODH reactions of undeuterated (C3H8) and perdeuterated (C3D8) propane (k‘C-H and k‘C-D, respectively) were obtained from the initial rates of propene formation using C3H8−O2 or C3D8−O2 mixtures. Kinetic isotope effects for propane direct combustion and for secondary propene combustion can also be measured from the initial rates of COx formation and from the effect of residence time on propene selectivity for C3H8−O2 and C3D8−O2 mixtures. 25
A rigorous analysis of the kinetic isotope effects requires that we treat the system using the reaction network of Scheme 1. At relatively low conversions and without external H2O addition, the rate of each of these reactions is well described by
where ki is the apparent first-order rate coefficient for reaction i. The propene selectivity at relatively low conversions in a batch reactor is given by5
where Cv is the concentration of Mo atoms per unit reactor volume, t is the reaction time in the batch reactor, and S0 = k‘1/(k‘1 + k‘2) is the initial propene selectivity (as t goes to zero). The initial rate of propene conversion (as t → 0) gives the value of k‘1. The initial propene selectivity (S0) depends on the k‘1/k‘2 ratio which can then be used to calculate k‘2. Finally, k‘3 is obtained from the dependence of selectivity on time predicted by eq 10.
Reaction rate constants (k‘i,C-H and k‘i,C-D) for ODH of undeuterated propane, perdeuterated propane, and propane-2, 2-d2, were obtained from the rate of initial propene formation using reaction mixtures containing CH3CH2CH3/O2, CD3CD2CD3/O2, or CH3CD2CH3/O2. Kinetic isotope effects (defined as k‘i,C-H/k‘i,C-D ratios) for the three reactions in Scheme 1 are shown in Table 2. When using C3H8 and C3D8 as reactants, the kinetic isotope effect is greater than unity for all reactions, suggesting the involvement of C−H bonds in kinetically relevant steps. Propane ODH and propene combustion show similar kinetic isotope effects (2.3 and 2.1, respectively) consistent with rate-determining initial C−H bond activation steps for both reactions. These similar kinetic isotope effects suggest a kinetic resemblance between these two reactions that may include the requirements for similar active surface oxygen species. The kinetic isotope effect for propane combustion (1.6) is slightly lower than for propane dehydrogenation, suggesting that the formation of propene and COx from propane involves different active sites, as proposed previously.4,5,13,25

Propane and propene reactions involve the cleavage of C−H bonds in kinetically relevant steps. There are two kinds of C−H bonds in propane. The methyl C−H bonds have a dissociation enthalpy of 420 kJ/mol, and the methylene C−H bonds have a dissociation enthalpy of 401 kJ/mol. 26 Kinetic isotope effect measurements using CH3CH2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 cannot determine which C−H bond is involved in the initial activation step. However, CH3CD2CH3 is expected to react more slowly than CH3CH2CH3 if methylene C−H bonds are involved in the initial activation step. A similar rate for CH3CD2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3 would indicate that only methylene C−H bonds are involved in the rate-determining step and that the isotopic identity of the rest of the propane molecule does not influence reaction rates. In turn, similar rates for CH3CD2CH3 and CH3CH2CH3 would indicate that only methyl C−H bonds are involved in the rate-determining step. The data in Table 2 show that CH3CD2CH3 exhibits a normal KIE (with respect to CH3CH2CH3) for both propane dehydrogenation (1.7) and combustion (1.3). These values are smaller than those obtained when using CD3CD2CD3 and CH3CH2CH3 as isotopes (2.3 and 1.6, respectively), but greater than unity, suggesting that C−H bonds in both methyl and methylene groups can be involved in the rate-determining steps required for both propane dehydrogenation and combustion at these reaction conditions. These results differ from those obtained for VOx/ZrO2 at 593 K (propane dehydrogenation KIE of 2.8 for CD3CD2CD3, and KIE 2.7 for CH3CD2CH3 vs CH3CH2CH3).25 On VOx/ZrO2, KIE values clearly showed that only methylene C−H bonds are involved in the rate-determining C−H bond activation step. These differences in KIE values for MoOx and VOx catalysts may reflect mechanistic differences or merely the different reaction temperatures required for the two catalysts to reach measurable turnover rates. As a result of the lower reactivity of MoOx catalysts, the temperature of the KIE measurements was higher (688 K) than on VOx catalysts (593 K). Such higher temperatures would tend to decrease the selectivity for activating one specific C−H bond in propane, because bond energy difference for the two types of C−H bonds in propane is only 19 kJ mol-1. Recent DFT calculations 27 show that C−H bonds in both methyl and methylene groups in propane can be activated on V2O5 species, but the activation energy for methyl C−H bond reactions was much higher (9.4 kcal mol-1) than for the methylene C−H bond (14.5 kcal mol-1). As a result, propene conversion pathways involving methyl C−H group activation are much more sensitive to reaction temperature than the more facile paths involving methylene C−H bonds. This would imply, in turn, that KIE values for CH3CD2CH3 vs CH3CH2CH3 should decrease with increasing temperature and the KIE observed for CH3CD2CH3 vs CD3CD2CD3 should rise with increasing temperatures. This is exactly the trend observed when KIE values on Mo-based catalysts at 688 K are compared with those the V-based catalysts at 593 K. Thus, it appears unnecessary to propose a different activation selectivity for the two types of C−H bonds in VOx and MoOx catalysts.
Kinetic isotopic effects for propene combustion on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were also measured; they are shown in Table 2. Propene molecules contain three types of C−H bonds.26 It is not possible, however, to determine which specific C−H bond is cleaved in the rate-determining step for propene conversion to COx by simple inspection of KIE values using CH3CD2CH3/O2 reactants. Figure 8 shows the deuterium distribution in propene during reactions of C3H8/C3D8/O2 mixtures. The binomial distribution of deuterium observed in propene at all chemical conversions shows that H is mobile on the catalyst surface and that multiple exchange of C3H6 and C3D6 with the surface adsorbed hydrogen (OH*/OD*) pool occurs rapidly during ODH reactions, leading to a statistical distribution of D atoms in propene molecules, irrespective of the isotopic locations in the starting mixture. Therefore, propene formed from CH3CD2CH3/O2 contains CH3CDCH2, as well as all other isotopomers (C3H6-xDx), and as a result the measured KIE reflects an average value for all possible propene isotopomers.

H/D ratios in the propene formed from C3H8/C3D8/O2 mixtures confirm the relative rates of C−H and C−D bond activation. The H/D ratio in the reactant mixture is approximately 1, but initial propene products have an H/D ratio of 2.6 on MoOx/ZrO2 at all contact times between 0.1 and 2 h (Figure 9). This value is very similar to that obtained for the kinetic isotope effect (2.3) from the conversion of separate C3H8−O2 and C3D8−O2 mixtures to propene (Table 2).
Figure 9 H/D ratio in propene formed from C3H8/C3D8/O2 mixtures on MoOx/ZrO2 (688 K, 7.1 kPa of C3H8, 7.1 kPa of C3D8, 1.7 kPa of O2, balance He, gradientless batch reactor).
Reversible Recombinative Desorption of OH Groups To Form Water. Water forms during propane ODH reactions and it inhibits propane reaction rates (Figure 5); therefore, the formation of water must involve a reversible elementary step. This effect of water is similar to that observed for propane reactions on VOx/ZrO215 and for ethane reactions on V2O5/SiO2.23 The reversible nature of the recombinative desorption of OH groups to form water was confirmed from the D-distribution in propene molecules formed on MoOx/ZrO2 from C3H8/D2O/O2 or C3D8/H2O/O2 mixtures. Neither mixture led to the formation of C3HxD8-x (0 < x < 8) isotopomers in unreacted propane even at ∼2 h contact times (∼4% propane conversion); this confirms that C−H bond activation steps are irreversible. Binomial D-distributions were detected at all contact times in the propene molecules formed from either C3H8/D2O/O2 or C3D8/H2O/O2 (Figure 10). These data show that water dissociatively adsorbs on MoOx surfaces during propane ODH, and that its microscopic reverse, the recombination of OH groups to form water during ODH, is therefore a reversible step. The binomial D-distributions in propene from C3H8/D2O/O2 or C3D8/H2O/O2 mixtures also suggest that H atoms formed from C−H bonds in propane and from O−H in water are mobile and that multiple exchange of C3H6 or C3D6 with this surface OH*/OD* pool occurs during propane ODH. These results are consistent with the assumption of quasi-equilibrated, recombinative desorption of OH groups (reaction 4), which was used in order to describe the inhibition of propane ODH by water. The form of the kinetic rate expression measured for propane ODH on MoOx is more specifically consistent with the quasi-equilibration of this step.

Irreversible Oxygen Dissociation and Involvement of Lattice Oxygen Atoms. The rate of propane ODH over MoOx/ZrO2 (in the absence of added water) is independent of the O2 concentration, suggesting that lattice oxygen atoms on a saturated surface are involved in this reaction, as also proposed by others.11-15 The involvement of lattice oxygen atoms was confirmed by carrying out propane ODH using 18O2 on Mo16Ox measuring the relative concentrations of 18O and 16O in the H2O and COx products initially formed. Figure 11 shows the isotopic content in the H2O formed from 18O2−C3H8 mixtures on 11 wt % Mo16Ox/Zr16O2. Initially, water consists predominately of H216O, as expected if C3H8 reacted with lattice 16O atoms in Mo16Ox. As contact time increased, the H218O concentration increased because 16O atoms in the lattice are gradually replaced by 18O from the 18O2 in the gas phase. Figure 12a shows the isotopic distribution in CO2. Initially, the predominant isotopomer is C16O2, suggesting that lattice oxygen atoms are also required for the combustion reactions that form COx. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature.15,28,29 Figure 12b shows the isotopic content of CO2 as a function of reaction time. Similar to what is seen for H2O, the percentage of 16O decreases with the increase of contact time, while that of 18O increases.

Figure 12 (a, top) Fraction of CO2 isotopes formed during reactions of 18O2−C3H8 mixtures on Mo16Ox/Zr16O2 (688 K, 14.2 kPa of C3H8, 1.7 kPa of 18O2, balance He, gradientless batch reactor). (b, bottom) Fraction of 18O and 16O in CO2 formed during reactions of 18O2−C3H8 mixtures on Mo16Ox/Zr16O2 (688 K, 14.2 kPa of C3H8, 1.7 kPa of 18O2, balance He, gradientless batch reactor).
The reversibility of dissociative O2 chemisorption steps was probed by using 18O2−16O2−C3H8 reactant mixtures and measuring the rate of formation of 18O16O molecules, which can only arise from a reversible dissociation event. Reversible dissociative chemisorption of O2 would lead to rapid isotopic equilibration of 16O2 and 18O2 during ODH reactions; irreversible chemisorption steps would preserve the isotopic purity of the reactant mixture. Figure 13 shows the rates of propane and oxygen chemical conversion and the rate of formation of 16O18O isotopomers on Mo16Ox/Zr16O2 as a function of contact time. 18O16O molecules are formed at a rate about 100 times smaller than the rate at which propane or oxygen are consumed by chemical reactions. Trace amounts of 18O16O are only observed after a contact time of ∼2 h (at ∼70% O2 conversion). This suggests that dissociative O2 chemisorption steps (step 5) required in propane ODH are irreversible at the conditions of these experiments.
Figure 13 C3H8 and O2 consumption rates, and 16O18O formation rates from 18O2−16O2−C3H8 mixtures on Mo16Ox/Zr16O2 (688 K, 14.2 kPa of C3H8, 0.85 kPa of 18O2, 0.85 kPa of 16O2, balance He, gradientless batch reactor).
Since O2 dissociation is irreversible and 16O18O molecules do not form during reactions of 18O2−C3H8 mixtures on Mo16Ox/Zr16O2, the amount of 16O coming from lattice oxygen can be calculated from O2 conversion and 16O concentration in products COx and H2O. The total amount of 16O in the Mo16O3 phase supported on ZrO2 is 80 μmol (calculated from MoO3 concentration and amount of catalyst used). At 70% O2 conversion, the 16O fraction in water and COx products is 0.5; this corresponds to 191 μmol 16O in the products, which must have come from the lattice. This value exceeds the number of lattice oxygens in the supported MoOx phase (80 μmol), but it is much smaller than the total amount of 16O available in the MoO3 and ZrO2 (587 μmol) components of the catalyst. Therefore, lattice oxygens in both the MoOx active phase and the ZrO2 support exchange rapidly during propane ODH reactions at 688 K. Consequently, lattice oxygens from both MoO3 and ZrO2 support are ultimately used in propane reactions.
Conclusions
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on MoOx/ZrO2, MoO3/ZrO2, and ZrMo2O8/ZrO2 catalysts occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps. Propene is the most abundant primary product. CO and CO2 form via either secondary combustion of propene, or by direct combustion of propane. The dependences of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical on supported MoOx, MoO3, and ZrMo2O8 powders, suggesting that similar active centers are present on these catalysts surfaces. The reaction kinetics are consistent with a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence in which lattice oxygen atoms participate in the irreversible activation of C−H bonds in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene and the remaining OH groups recombine to form water and reduced Mo centers. These reduced Mo centers reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. The recombination of OH groups to form water is reversible. The assumption that surface oxygen and OH groups are the most abundant surface intermediates leads to a rate expression that describes accurately the measured kinetics of propane ODH reactions. Isotopic tracer studies fully confirm the assumptions required in order to describe the observed effects of reactant and product concentrations on the rate of propane ODH reactions.
