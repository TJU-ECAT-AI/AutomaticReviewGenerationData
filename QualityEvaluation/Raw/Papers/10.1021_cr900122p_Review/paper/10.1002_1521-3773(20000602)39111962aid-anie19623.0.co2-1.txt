Low-Temperature Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes Catalyzed by a Silica-Supported Tantalum Hydride Complex, and Evidence for a Mechanistic Switch from Group IV to Group V Metal Surface Hydride Complexes
Graphical Abstract
Carbon-carbon bond cleavage by a new mechanism, probably based on σ-bond metathesis, is reported for a silica-supported tantalum hydride, (≡SiO)2TaH (1). This complex, which is also able to realize alkane metathesis, catalytically cleaves the carbon–carbon bond of alkanes under mild conditions.
