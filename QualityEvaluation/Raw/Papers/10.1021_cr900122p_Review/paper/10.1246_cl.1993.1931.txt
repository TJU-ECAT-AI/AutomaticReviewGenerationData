Abstract
Silica grafted hafnium hydride complexes were synthesized from tetra(neopentyl)hafnium and a partially dehydroxylated silica. These surface complexes are catalysts for hydrogenolysis of neopentane and butane and for hydrogenation of isobutene and propene, under mild conditions. Their catalytic properties are compared to the related supported Zr Hydride complexes.
