Abstract: A 75.4-MHz ”C CPMAS NMR spectroscopic study of the surface structures and reaction chemistry of a series 
of organoactinides adsorbed on 
various inorganic supports is reported. On Lewis acid surfaces such as dehydroxylated AlzO3, 
MgClz, and SiOz-A1203, 
it is found that organothorium complexes of the type C P ’ ~ T ~ R ~  
(Cp’ = $-(CH3)sCs; R = I3CH3, 
‘3CH213CH3), 
Cp’ThR, (R = l3CH2C6Hs), 
and Cp3ThR (Cp = qS-CSH5; 
R = I3CH3), 
undergo heterolytic Th-C scission to 
transfer an alkyl anion to the surface forming Cp’,ThR, Cp’ThR3-, or Cp3Th 
adsorbate species with ‘cation-like” character. 
Probe 
studies with paramagnetic 
Cp’2U(’%H3) indicate that the majority of the transferred methyl groups of Cp’2U(’3CH3)z/DA 
and Cp’2U(’3CH3)z/MgC1z 
are located 25 A from the U(1V) ion. O
n
 less dehydroxylated or more basic supports such as 
SiOZ-Mg0, SO2, 
and MgO, pox0 species of the type Cp’,Th(CH,)O- are formed, by Th-C protonolysis or by transfer of 
an alkyl group to the surface. For CP’~U(’~CH,)~/S~O~, 
the majority of the resulting 13CH3-Si(surface) functionalities are 
25 A from the actinide center. In agreement with heterogeneous catalytic studies, the NMR data reveal that only a small 
percentage of Cp’zTh(13CH3)2/DA 
or Cp‘Th(’3CHzC6HS)3/DA 
surface sites undergo reaction with ethylene or H2 
at 25 OC. 
In contrast, 50 f 
10% of Cp’zTh(’3CH3)2/MgC1z 
sites undergo reaction with ethylene; >90 f 
10% of ethylene insertion/ 
polymerization occurs at Th-CH, with k(propagation)/k(initiation) = 12 in the initial stages. There is no 
evidence for methane 
evolution via C-H functionalization nor for significant rates of Th(CHzCHz),13CH3-’3CH3Mg(surface) 
alkyl group permutation. 
At 25 ‘C, a large percentage of Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC1z 
Th-CH, and Mg-CH, functionalities undergo hydrogenolysis, with 
Th-CH, being slightly more reactive. In competition experiments, Th-CH, is far more reactive than Mg-CH, in migratory 
CO insertion, 
and products are inferred to be, inter alia, $-acyl complexes. Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/MgC12 
undergoes reaction with 
propylene to yield methane (derived from Th-CH3), a Th(q3-allyl) complex, and what appear to be propylene oligomers. 
It is well-established that adsorption on 
high surface area metal 
oxides can profoundly enhance the reactivity/catalytic activity 
of metal hydr~carbyls.’-~ 
While such phenomena are of con- 
siderable scientific and technological interest, our understanding 
of the surface coordination chemistry, much less the nature of 
the active catalytic sites, is at a very primitive level. Moreover, 
it is not clear that conventional photon/particle absorption, 
scattering, or diffraction surface science t00ls‘J will b
e
 particularly 
incisive in structurally characterizing such adsorbates on 
irregular 
surfaces at less than monolayer coverage. 
Recent research in this laboratory has employed organo- 
actinides6 
as model hydrocarbyl adsorbates.’ Organoactinides

Cp’,Th(CH3)* on PDA, PDS, and DS, along with spectral sim- 
ilarities to unreactive Cd2Th(CH3)OR 
compounds,ls suggests 
different, “p-oxo-like” adsorbate structures B, C, and D, re- 
spectively.I2 Nevertheless, these preliminary oxide support results 
leave many questions unanswered. From a descriptive, coordi- 
nation chemistry standpoint, the generality of this picture in regard 
to support (other oxides, halides) and complex (other precursor 
structures) is unclear. Whether A might be a p-alkyl,l6 E, whether 
Th-R and AI-R groups can interchange,16 
and what the reactivity 
of such surface functionalities is with respect to olefins, H,, CO, 
etc., remain to be answered. Finally, the relevance of the above 
phenomenology to the observed catalytic properties and the 
structural models to the actual catalytic sites are unexplored.

In the present contribution, we present a full discussion of our 
high field (75.4 MHz), high-resolution solid-state I3C NMR 
investigations of supported organoactinide structural and surface 
~hemistry.l’*~* 
This includes a full examination of a range of 
supports (AI2O3, 
MgCI2, SiO2-AI2O3, SO2-MgO, MgO) and 
metal complexes (Cp’,AnR2, Cp’AnR,, Cp,AnR), in situ chemical 
dosing/adsorbate reactivity studies, and the use of paramagnetic 
U(IV) adsorbates in a new approach to probing metrical aspects 
of the surface complexation. It is seen that this integrated 
chemical/spectroscopic approach affords a far more complete 
picture of this unusual but, in all likelihood, 
surface 
organometallic chemistry. Moreover, important connections are 
demonstrated between the heterogeneous catalytic phenomenology 
and the spectroscopic structure/reactivity observations. 
Experimental Section 
Materials and Methods. All procedures were performed in Schlenk- 
type glassware interfaced to a high-vacuum (10-4-10-5 Torr) line or in 
a nitrogen-filled Vacuum Atmospheres glovebox equipped with an effi- 
cient recirculating atmosphere purification system (typically 2-3 ppm 
02). 
Argon (Matheson, prepurified), hydrogen (Linde), and CO 
(Matheson CP) were purified further by passage through MnO/Ver- 
miculite and Davison 4A molecular sieves. Other gases including pro- 
pylene (Matheson), ethylene (Matheson), ethylene-1,2-”C2 (99% W ;  
Cambridge Isotopes), CO-I3C 
(99% I3C; Cambridge Isotopes), and pro- 
pylene-2-I3C (60% IsC; MSD Isotopes) were purified by passage through 
MnO/Si02. The 3,3-dimethylbutene (Aldrich) was dried over Na/K, 
vacuum transferred into a storage tube equipped with a Teflon valve, and 
stored under an argon atmosphere. Pentane (Aldrich HPLC grade) was 
vacuum transferred from either Na/K or CaH2 
and stored in vacuo over 
Na/K in bulbs on the vacuum line. 
The compounds ”CH3Li-LiI,’h Cp’,Th(CHJ2,I9 Cp’2Th(”CH,)2,1” 
(CH2CH3)2, and Cp’2Th(CHzCH2CH2CH3),22 
were prepared accord- 
ing to published procedures. Cp’zTh(13CH213CH3)2 
was prepared from 
[ C P ’ ~ T ~ ( ~ - H ) H ] ,  
and 90% ethylene-1,2-”Cz,19 
and Cp,Th(13CH,) was 
synthesized from Cp,ThCI and 13CH,Li.LiI.20 By using the synthetic 
procedure for Cp’Th(CHZC6H5),,2’ Cp’Th( 13CH2C6H5)3 
was prepared 
from C6H5I3cH2Li 
and Cp’ThC13(THF)z. The reagent, C6H513CHzLi, 
was in turn prepared from C6H5”cH3 and n-b~tyllithium;~’ 
the ”C 
labeled toluene was prepared from C6H5I3COOH 
(Cambridge Isotope, 
99% 13C).u The complex Cp’2U(13CH3)2 
was prepared from Cp’,UCI2 
and ”CH,Li.LiI by using the method for C P ’ ~ U ( C H ~ ) ~ . ’ ~  
The purity of 
these reagents was checked by IH NMR. 
The supports DA and DS were prepared as previously described.’J2 
Magnesium chloride (surface area = 100 m2 
g-l) was supplied by Dow 
Chemical Co. and was pretreated under high vacuum ( 
Torr), 30O0, 
2 (this code indicates heating at 300 OC for 2 h). Alternatively, MgC12 
was prepared by reaction of dibutylmagnesium (Lithium Corp. of Am- 
erica) with HCI (Matheson VLSl grade) in pentane by using greaseless 
high vacuum line techniques (surface area = 100 m2 
g-I). It was again 
pretreated under high vacuum, 300°, 2. SiOz-AlzO, (Davison 970 grade, 
13% AI20,, 60-80 mesh material) was purified by the same procedure 
as for PHF A1203,12 
followed by treatment in flowing He, 950°, 0.5 
(surface area = 56 m2 g-I). Partially dehydroxylated MgO (Calgon 
Maglite CG-I) was treated in flowing He, 680°, 0.5 (surface area = 
46 
m2 
g-l). and Si02-Mg0 (Grace SM-30) 
was treated in flowing He, Emo, 
0.5 (surface area = 275 mz g
l
)
.
 
All supports were stored in vacuum- 
tight glass storage tubes under an inert nitrogen atmosphere.

 Organoactinides 
solution containing a measured quantity of the organoactinide complex 
of interest was filtered onto a carefully weighed quantity of support. The 
resulting slurry was then stirred for at least 2 h with exclusion of light. 
The slurry was next filtered, and the impregnated support was collected 
on the glass frit. This material was then washed with 5 X 5 mL portions 
of pentane distilled and condensed from the filtrate and was dried in 
vacuo. Maximum loadings of organoactinides on MgCI2 were -0.25 
An/nm2, while higher loadings (-0.5 An/“) 
are achievable on DA 
and DS.

pmol Th) was spread 
on the bottom of a 250” 
Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was equipped 
with a Teflon valve adapter through which it could be interfaced to the 
high vacuum line. The flask was sealed, removed from the glovebox, 
connected to the vacuum line, and evacuated. The vessel was then cooled 
to 77 K, and a measured quantity of ethylene was admitted. The flask 
was maintained at 77 K for 30 min and was then allowed to warm slowly 
to rwm temperature while continuously monitoring the pressure. At ca. 
-10 OC, uptake of ethylene began. After ensuring that the reaction was 
complete (4 h at room temperature), the flask was evacuated to remove 
any volatiles, resealed, and returned to the glovebox so that an NMR 
sample could be prepared. Reactions of CO, I’CO, propylene, 60% 
propylene-2-I3C, and 3,3-dimethylbutene were conducted in the same 
way. For reactions with hydrogen, the procedure was modified such that 
after the initial evacuation of the flask containing the supported orga- 
noactinide, it was filled to ca. 1 atm with hydrogen and sealed off. After 
the desired reaction time, the excess hydrogen was removed in vacuo. 
High-Resolution Solid-State 
”C NMR Spectroscopy. All I3C solid- 
state NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VXR300 spectrometer 
(75.4 MHz) equipped with either a Doty Scientific 7 mm or 5 mm high 
speed solids probe. High-power ‘H decoupling (-65 kHz decoupling 
field), cross-polarization (CP), and magic angle spinning (MAS) were 
employed for routine experiments. Air-sensitive samples were loaded into 
cylindrical sapphire rotors in the glovebox. The rotors were capped at 
both ends with either O-ring sealed Macor caps (7- and 5-mm rotors) 
or Kel-F caps (5-mm rotors only). Both types of caps provide an air-tight 
seal under nonspinning conditions. MAS was achieved by using boil-off 
nitrogen as the spinning gas to prevent sample exposure to air. Spinning 
rates of 3.5-4.2 kHz were routinely achieved with the 7-mm probe. With 
the 5-mm probe, spinning rates of up to 8.5 (Macor rotor caps) and 10.0 
kHz (Kel-F caps) could be achieved. Control experiments using highly 
sensitive samples that undergo distinct color changes upon oxidation 
(NaC,H,; Cp’2U(CH3)2/DA) 
or in which the rotor cap was briefly re- 
moved in air (to determine oxidation-induced spectral changes) indicated 
negligible sample deterioration in this spinning configuration over time 
periods as long as 72 h. For both probes, the magic angle was initially 
set by using neat KBr. The stability of the angle setting was routinely 
monitored by observing the aromatic carbon line shape of neat hexa- 
methylbenzene. Spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (6 0) by 
using the aromatic carbon resonance of hexamethylbenzene (6 132.1) as 
a secondary reference by the substitution method. The I3C 90° pulse 
width and the initial Hartmann-Hahn matching condition were deter- 
mined by using the hexamethylbenzene standard sample. 
For routine spectra of neat and supported organoactinides, the opti- 
mum cross-polarization contact time was found to be 4.0-4.5 ms (7-mm 
probe) and 2.5 ms (5-mm probe). The optimum recycle time was found 
to be 4-5 s. For neat organoactinide complexes, satisfactory spectra 
could be obtained by coaddition of 100-500 transients, while for sup- 
ported organoactinides, the coaddition of 5000-1 5 000 transients was 
necessary. Before Fourier transformation, all FID’s were weighted with 
a standard apodization function, exp(-t2/a2), where a = 0.04 s for neat 
organoactinides (-3 Hz line broadening) and a = 0.003 
s for supported 
organoactinides (- I20 Hz line broadening). 
Because of the paramagnetism, atypical methods were necessarily 
employed to obtain Cp’2U(’3CH3)2 
13C NMR spectra. The solution 
I3CI1HJ 
spectrum (C6D6) 
of Cp’,U(I3CHJ2 was measured on the JEOL 
FX90 using a 50 kHz window. The U-I3CH3 
resonance was located at 
6 1480, and variation of the transmitter offset confirmed that this peak 
was not a foldover. The Cp’-CH3 resonance was located at 6 -30, and 
the Cp’C signal was not observed. In the solid-state ”C CPMAS NMR 
spectrum of Cp’2U(’3CH3)2 
obtained by the standard procedure (vide 
supra), the Cp’-CH3 resonance was very broad (2500 H
z
)
 
and appeared 
at 6 
-32. No 
other resonances were observable by using CP techniques, 
presumably due to the short I3C Ti's. However, the U-I3CH3 resonance 
could be observed by application of simple 90° I3C observation pulses 
combined with dipolar ‘H decoupling and MAS. This resonance evi- 
denced an extensive manifold of spinning sidebands, and the largest 
possible spectral window was employed (100 kHz). The spectrum was 
referenced by setting the upfield edge of the window to 6 
200 by using 
J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 112, No. 17, 1990 6223 
the carbonyl resonance of liquid acetone (6 205.4) as a secondary ref- 
erence. With this external referencing, the U-I3CH3 
isotropic chemical 
shift was located at 6 1430 and confirmed by varying both the transmitter 
offset and the spinning speed. Unfortunately, the spectral window was 
not large enough to encompass the entire sideband pattern. 
Results and Discussion 
We begin with a structurally oriented discussion of the I3C 
CPMAS NMR spectroscopy of Cp’,Th(I3CH3), adsorbed on 
various dehydroxylated (Le., having the lowest surface OH cov- 
erage readily achievable 
by thermal or chemical means) supports. 
We then probe the generality of selected aspects of the surface 
chemistry by using Cp‘Th(13CH2C6H5)3, 
Cp3Th(I3CH3), 
and 
Cp’zTh(13CH213CH3)2 
as labeled adsorbates. Methyl group spatial 
relationships in surface complexes are next examined by using 
paramagnetic Cp’,U(I3CHJ2 as an adsorbate. Finally, the surface 
chemistry of the CP’~A~( 
13CH3)2/support 
complexes is examined, 
in situ, with respect to ethylene polymerization and H2, 
CO, and 
propylene reactivity.

Figure 1A shows 
the 75.4-MHz 13C 
CPMAS spectrum of Cp’,Th(I3CH3), adsorbed 
on DA at a coverage of ca. 0.25 Th nm-2. Assignments (Table 
I) follow straightforwardly from 13C/’2C 
substitution, dipolar 
dephasing  experiment^,^' and data for model compounds. The 
low field (6 71.0) methyl signal is assigned to a “cation-like” 
Th+-CH3 
functionality (cf., 6 71.8 in Cp’zTh(CH3)+B(C6HS)4-)13 
and the upfield signal to an 27A1-CH3 
functionality. This latter 
assignment and the quadrupole-induced broadeningz6 are sup- 
ported by model compounds,l” and the expected26 
line narrowing 
is observed at higher magnetic fields. Several experiments were 
also carried out to probe the motional characteristics of 
Cp’,Th(13CH3)z/DA. Cessation of dipolar decoupling 
and Bloch 
decay experiment~l~q~~ 
yielded featureless spectra, while variable 
CP time  experiment^^^ (0.8-10.0 ms) produced no significant 
changes in relative spectral intensities. Thus, any motional pro- 
cesses that appreciably average C-H dipolar interactions do not 
differ greatly in anisotropy. Spectra of Cp’zTh(13CH3)2/DA 
frequently exhibit a second, smaller Th-I3CH3 signal at 6 
= 
60. 
This feature is the dominant Th-13CH3 resonance in Cp’,Th-

Dipolar dephasing and 13C/’2C 
substitution support 
this assignment (Table I). Interestingly, Bloch decay experiments 
yield a featureless I3C spectrum except for a weak signal in the 
Mg-CH3 region, suggesting limited isotropic mobility of these 
surface functionalities. The weak spectral feature at ca. 6

can 
be assigned on 
the basis of results with PDA (vide infra)IIa 
and 
other supports (vide infra) to a Cp’,Th(CH3)O- species (B).)O” 
Figure 1 C presents the CPMAS spectrum of Cp’,Th( 13CH3), 
adsorbed on highly dehydroxylated (a. 
0.4 a-OH nm-2)30b 
silica 
(DS; 
ca. 0.25Th nm-,). Assignments are given in Table I. On 
the basis of model compounds, the resonance at 6 
-5.4 is ascribed 
to a surface Si-CH, functionality (cf., 
6 -1.0 for I3CH3Li 
adsorbed 
on DS).12b 
The Th-CH3 
resonance at 6 59.0 occurs at considerably 
higher field than is associated with “cation-like” species (vide 
supra), 
but in close proximity to 6 
Th-CH3 
for Cp’,Th(CH,)OR’ 
model complexes (6 59.2, R’ = Si(CH3)2(t-C4H9)).’2b 
These 
results are most compatible with a fully Th-0 a-bonded “p- 
oxo-like” 
structure (e.g., D). Noteworthy in addition to the ab- 
sence of a ”cation-like” species is the complete lack of olefin 
hydrogenation activity by Cp’,Th(13CHJ2/DS.

cannot 
be rigorously identified, the spectral line shape in the 6 -20-20 
region is consistent with the presence of an underlying, quadru- 
polar-broadened 27AI-CH3 
signal superimposed 
upon the narrower

The CPMAS 
spectrum of CP’,T~(I~CH~)~/DSM 
(Figure IE, Table I) exhibits 
a high field resonance at 6 -7.3 assignable to Si-CH3 and/or 
Mg-CH, groups (vide supra). The Th-CH3 signal at 6 59.1 is 
consistent with a Cp’,Th(CH,)O- 
a-bonded structure. The 
CPMAS spectrum of Cp’,Th( 13CH3)2/partially 
dehydroxylated 
MgO (PDM, Figure 1 
F, Table I) provides no 
evidence of methyl 
transfer to surface Mg2+ 
centers. Rather, only relatively high field 
Th-CH, signals at 6 62.1, 55.5, and 52.3 are observed. These 
can be ascribed to Cpt2Th(CH3)G 
species with the multiplicity 
of Th-CH, chemical shifts presumably reflecting the heterogeneity 
of surface microenvironments. The basic spectral pattern is 
reminiscent of that exhibited by Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/PDA.1k

The resonances 
at 6 123.3 and 6 13.0 are ascribed to the Cp’-C and CpCCH, 
groups, respectively (Table I). The crystallographically non- 
equivalent2I 
Th-13CH2 moieties give rise to the three intense signals 
at 6 81.8,79.0, and 76.2; assignment is confirmed by the dimin- 
ution of these features in Cp’Th(CH2C6H5), (Figure 2B). The 
aromatic benzyl carbon atoms give rise to several resonances in 
the 6 145-120 region. The CPMAS spectrum of Cp’Th- 
(13CH2C6Hs)3/DA 
is shown in Figure 2C. In 
addition to Cp’-C 
and Cp’-CH, resonances at 6 126.8 and 10.1, respectively, an 
intense 27AI-CH2 
signal is observed at 6 20.2 (6 21.0 in AI-

(other Th-CH2- resonances at 6 75.2 and 66.4). The 27AI-CH2 
assignment is additionally supported by the observation of an 
identical feature when Li13CH2C6H5 
is adsorbed on 
DA. These 
results for C P ‘ T ~ ( ” C H ~ C ~ H ~ ) ~ / D A  
are in accord with benzyl 
transfer to AI3+ surface sites and the formation again of 
“cation-like” 
species (eg., F). Evidence against a a-bonded pox0 
species (e.g., G) is provided by the spectrum of the aryloxide

(Figure 2D). As in the case of 
C P ’ , T ~ ( C H ~ ) ~  
versus CP’~T~(CH,)OR 
(vide supra), alkoxide 
ligands induce an upfield displacement of hydrocarbyl a-carbon 
resonances. Thus, the Th-CH2 signals now occur at 6 35.4 and 
32.3. In accord with the ‘cationic” formulation for Cp’Th- 
(CH2C6H5),/DA, 
this material exhibits very high activity for olefin 
hydrogenation and polymerization (higher than Cp’,Th- 
(CH3)2/DA).7b*34 
However, as assayed by CO poisoning ex-

(Figure 3A)35a

is adsorbed upon

the spectrum (Figure 3B, Table I)35a shows essentially complete 
transfer of the methyl groups to surface AI3+ 
sites, as evidenced 
by an 27AI-CH3

broader in Cp’2Th(’3CH213CH3)2

same FID weighting). This broadening is doubtless a consequence 
of residual I3C-I3C dipolar coupling3” that is not completely 
removed by the MAS employed as 
well as 13C-13C 
scalar coupling 
(anticipated to be -35 Hz’~~). 
The spectrum of Cp’,Th- 
(13CH213CH3)2/MgC12 
(Figure 4B) is consistent with the 
’cation-like” model advanced for Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12 
with 
Cp’-C at 6 
126.3, a Th-CH2- resonance centered at lower field 
(6 76.0), 
a broad Mg-CH2- resonance centered at ca. 6 20 (6 -2.9 
in CH3CH2MgBr),29b 
and sharper coincident Th-CH2CH3, 
Mg- 
CH2CH3, and Cp’-CH3 signals at 6 10.0 (6 12.2 in 
CH3CH2MgBr). An alternative assignment would attribute the 
broad envelope at 6 40-0 to overlapping Mg-CH2- and Mg-C- 
H2CH3 resonances, broadened by the heterogeneity of surface 
environments, residual I3C-l3C dipolar coupling, and scalar 
coupling. 
Attempts were also made to adsorb Cp3Th(I3CH3) 
on

by using the standard procedures. However, thorough pentane 
washing removed all traces of the organometallic, and a CPMAS 
spectrum could not be detected.

In 
general, the observed solution paramagnetic shifts are composed 
of “dipolar” (from magnetic anisotropy in the absence of cubic 
symmetry) and ‘contact” spin density delocalization (from a 
variety of mechanisms, including polarization of ligand orbitals 
by metal 6s and 6p orbitals as well as direct covalent spin density 
transfer from metal 5f orbitals)  contribution^.^^^ Assuming a 
purely f orbital description for U(IV) (unquenched orbital angular 
momentum) and a point dipole approximation, the dipolar shift 
for ligand nucleus i in solution can be expressed in terms of 
structure-dependent geometric factors and the magnetic anisotropy 
of the complex (eq 1).38*39 Here, N is Avogadro’s number, the

simplifies considerably (eq 2).38*39 
In 
cases of axial symmetry 
(uranocenes, Cp3UX), it has been possible to approximately de- 
compose the observed paramagnetic shifts into dipolar and spin

spectrum of Cp’,U(I3CH3), 
exhibits 
a U-CH, resonance at 6 1480 
ppm, considerably downfield from that of the diamagnetic thorium 
analogue (6 68.5). Hence, the effects of the U(IV) center are 
extremely large for this directly u-bonded alkyl group. The 
Cp’-CH3 resonance occurs at 6 -30.0, and the Cp% signal could 
not be located. For solid Cp’,U(I3CH3),, it was found that the 
U-CH3 signal could be most effectively observed (presumably 
because of the very short TI and very large shift) without CP 
techniques. As a consequence 
of the large solid-state paramagnetic 
anisotropy, an extensive spinning sideband pattern is observed 
(Figure 5A). Variation of the spectral window and spinning rate 
allowed location of the U-CH3 resonance at 6 1430 f 
20. 
Considering the slight differences in the FX90 
and VXR300 probe 
temperatures and the experimental difficulties in acquiring the 
solid-state spectrum, this result is in good agreement with that 
in solution (6 1480, vide supra). The Cp’-CH3 signal could be 
observed by standard CPMAS as a broad peak at 6 -25 (Figure 
SB), 
only slightly displaced from the solution position (6 -30, vide 
supra). These results indicate that useful 13C 
spectra of Cp’,UR, 
complexes can be recorded in the solid state and that MAS 
sufficiently removes condensed phase anisotropy effects to reveal 
isotropic spectral features. The large shifts imparted to proximate 
nuclei suggest an efficacious means to probe metal-alkyl group 
distances on 
the surface.

(‘3CH3)2/DA 
and C P ’ ~ U ( ~ ~ C H ~ ) ~ / D A ,  
respectivley, 
at identical 
loadings. Adamantane has been added as an internal standard 
for normalizing intensities. The spectrum of Cp12U( 
‘3CH3)2/DA 
evidences no obvious Cp’U or U-CH, specral features either in 
Figure 6B or in scans over wider sweepwidths. Of course, such 
features are expected to be broad and rather weak under these 
conditions (cf., Figure 5
)
.
 In contrast, the center of the AI-CH3 
signal in Cp’2U(’3CH3)2/DA 
is only slighly displaced upfield (55 
ppm) from that in CP’~T~( 
13CH3),/DA, 
is only slightly broadened, 
and represents 90 f 
10% of the expected spectral intensity. If 
the Cp’-CH3 resonance were present at the same field position 
as in neat Cp’2U(13CH3)2, 
it would be a broad envelope extending 
from -6 -50-0, having ca. 1/10 the intensity of the AI-CH3 
signal, Le., it would likely be obscured by the AI-CH, resonance. 
These results indicate 
that little if any U(1V) unpaired spin density 
or magnetic anisotropy is transmitted to the majority of the 
AI-CH, moieties. In similar experiments Th, U pairs were also 
examined for the Cp’2An(13CH3)z/MgC12 
(Figure 7) and 
Cp’2An(’3CH3)2/Si02 
(Figure 8) systems. In both cases, the 
surface methyl group signals experience little displacement (15 
ppm) and only minor broadening. In both cases, 90 f 
10% of 
the methyl signal intensity is accounted for. Again, little inter-

While exact quantitative analysis of U-CH3(surface) inter- 
actions requires detailed, presently unavailable knowledge of 
surface Cp’,UCH3+ magnetic anisotropy and spin delocalization, 
it is still possible to make physically reasonable, qualitative es- 
timations of the range of possible U.-CH,(surface) distances. In 
doing so, it is pragmatically assumed that spin delocalization and 
dipolar shifts are roughly similar to those in the well-studied,

Ethylene. In addition to probing 
adsorbate structure, CPMAS NMR offers the fascinating op- 
portunity to directly probe adsorbate reactivity. For example, the 
relative reactivity of An-alkyl versus surface-alkyl groups or of 
“cation-like” 
versus “p-oxo” species can be 
directly examined via 
in situ competition experiments with a variety of reagents. It will 
be seen that the study of polymerization processes by using iso- 
topically labeled reagents is particularly informative since the 
immobilized products encode “memory” 
effects. Experiments 
were 
first carried out in which Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/support 
systems were 
incrementally dosed with measured amounts of gaseous reagents 
and CPMAS spectra recorded. All possible efforts were made 
to rigorously exclude oxygen and water (see 
Experimental Section). 
Ethylene polymerization was investigated by using high vacuum 
line experiments in which Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/support 
catalysts were 
exposed to measured quantities of ethylene. Exposures were 
carried out at 77 K 
to allow diffusion of ethylene into the pores 
of the catalyst prior to polymerization, thus minimizing mass 
transport effects. The catalyst was then slowly warmed to room 
temperature, 
during which time ethylene uptake could be detected 
manometrically. The Cp’,Th(”CH,),/DA + 
ethylene system 
(Figure 9) reveals that incremental doses of olefin result in the 
growth of polyethylene resonances, with PE-CH2- expected at 
6 33 and PE-CH3 expected at 6 10-15 (degenerate with the 
Cp’-CH3 
but induces no perceptible changes in the 
CP’,T~(I~CH,)~/DA 
spectrum. Since insertion of ethylene into 
a Th-13CH3 or AI-13CH3 bond would result in large I3CH3 
chemical shift displacements, 
and since no obvious diminution of 
relative signal intensities is evident, it is concluded that only a 
small percentage of the surface sites is responsible for the po- 
lymerization (510%). Importantly these results agree well with 
the aforementioned carbonylation and protonolysis poisoning

change in either Th-13CH2- or AI-13CH2- resonances could be 
observed. Again, polymerization is deduced to occur at only a 
small percentage of the surface sites, in agreement with catalytic

ethylene doses under identical conditions results neither in the 
development of polyethylene signals nor in alteration of the existing 
adsorbate spectrum. This result is also in accord with results of 
catalytic 
studies7b 
and with a polymerization mechanism requiring 
an initiating, surface Thalkyl or Th-H functionality. 
In principal, it should be possible to estimate the degree of 
ethylene polymerization from these CPMAS spectra via the 
relative intensities 
of the CH2 
and CH3 
signals. However, since 
longer chains will have considerable mobility, which in turn will 
degrade CP effi~iency,~’,~~ 
we are reluctant to quantitatively 
analyze such data without exhaustive calibration studies. Fur- 
thermore, as noted above, the Cp’-CH3 and PE-CH, signals are 
nearly coincident. 
One characteristic 
of MgC12-supported 
Ziegler-Natta catalysts 
vis-&vis those supported on more conventional materials (e.g., 
AI2O3, 
Si02) 
is a far higher percentage of active sites? This effect 
is also observed in catalytic studies of MgC12-supported 
organo- 
actinides.”

relative to Cp’-C. During this same period, the polyethylene-CH2

of ethylene recorded as a function of Cp contact time (1, 3 - 5 4 ,  
and 9 ms) indicate that this quantitation is not adversely affected 
by changes in CP dynamics. Indeed, a strength of this assay is 
that it quantitates untransformed starting material of known CP 
and spin-lattice relaxation characteristics, 
rather than an emerging 
product of unknown characteristics. 
Relative spectral peak areas for the Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12 
+ ethylene experiment are plotted in Figure 11 as a function of 
equivalents of added ethylene. It is concluded that 50 f 
10% 
of 
the Th-CH, sites undergo olefin insertion under the experimental 
conditions. This result is in favorable 
agreement with protonolytic 
poisoning experiments, which indicate 35 f 
10% of Cp’,Th- 
(CH3),/MgC12 sites are active for propylene hydrogenation at 
-63 0C.7p 
In terms of selectivity, 
greater than 90 
f 
10% of olefin 
insertion events take place at the surface Th-CH3 functionality 
versus less than 10 f 
10% 
at the Mg-CH3 bond. Furthermore, 
comparison of the Th-CH3 peak 
intensity in Figure 11 versus the 
summed Cp’-CH, + PE-CH3 peak intensities as a function of 
added ethylene provides an important self-consistency 
check. If 
PE-”CH3 formation only occurs at the expense of Th-I3CH3 
moieties, then the consumption of the latter species should be 
correlated with the formation of the former. The coincidence of 
the levelling-off portions of the PE-I3CH3 and Th-I3CH3 plots 
in Figure 1 1  substantiates this relationship. That the entirety of 
the Th-l3CH3 intensity is not recovered in the PE-I3CH3 resonance 
is evidence of (not surprisingly) rather different methyl group 
motional characteristic, 
hence CP 
effi~iencies.~-~~ 
It is also possible 
to estimate kWption/kinitiation 
for the polymerization via analysis 
of the diminution of the Th-13CH3 signals as a function of ethylene 
uptake. Assuming that 50% of the Cp’,ThCH3+ surface sites 
undergo ethylene insertion at a uniform rate (OnCH,kiPdefin), 
that 
subsequent ethylene insertions also occur at a uniform rate 
($h(CHICH 
CH,k$dcfiJ, and that neither chain transfer (8-H 
e1imination)lnor chain termination is important, then eq 3 applies.‘8 
M is equivalents monomer consumed, f
,
 is the initial equivalents 
of initiator (Th-CH3) 
present, andJis the fraction of the initiator 
(3) 
consumed. For the initial region of ethylene uptake in Figure 10 
(0-5 equiv), this relationship 
yields k,/ki i
=
 12 ( M i =  
5; 
f 
i= 0.6). 
This result can be compared to relative ethylene insertion rates 
in the analogous, homogeneous Cp’,Sc-R 
system of k(R = 
CH2CH2CH3)/k(R 
= CH3) = 7.5 (4) at -80 OC.slc 
An alternative or at least competing interpretation of the 
spectral changes observed in Figure 10 would be a vinylic C-H 
activation 
which would also result in ethylene-

dependent decay of the Th-I3CH3 signal (eq 4). To test such 
Me - 
I I 
an alternative, gases evolved in the Cp’,Th(CH3),/MgC1, + 
ethylene reaction were collected by vacuum line techniques (77 
K silica gel trap) and released as a pulse to a calibrated gas 
chromatography 
Any evolved methane was below the 
detection limits, hence 52% of the Th sites react in this manner. 
The experiments of Figure 10 reveal other interesting aspects 
of Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12 
surface chemistry. First, the Th-I3CH3 
feature at 6 
60 assigned to a Cp’,Th(CH3)O- species (B) does 
not significantly change in intensity with ethylene dosing. This 
lower reactivity is in accord with other observations on Cp’,Th- 
(OR’)CH3 
chemistry in s o l ~ t i o n . ~ ~ . ~ ~ ~  
Second, these spectra and 
those recorded several days later evidence no perceptible 
variations 
in the residual Th-13CH3 and Mg-I3CH3 spectral intensities. 
Thus, transalkylative exchange of Th-R and Mg-R’ groups must 
be slow on 
the time scale of days. 
In principle, it should also be possible to carry out an experiment 
complementary to Figure 10 in which Cpt2Th(CH3),/MgCl2 
is 
incrementally 
dosed with I3CH,=l3CH,. 
In this case, the relative 
reactivity (but not the fraction of reactive sites) of the Th-CH3 
and Mg-CH3 
moieties would be monitored by the growth of the 
corresponding Th-13CH2- or Mg-I3CH2- signals. Efforts to 
conduct such experiments 
and to observe well-resolved M-I3CH2- 
signals as opposed to broad envelopes were frustrated by several 
factors. First, for significant degrees of ethylene polymerization, 
the very large ( 
13CH2’3CH2), 
resonance creates severe dynamic 
range problems and spinning sidebands in the spectral region 
expected for the Th-I3CH2- signal (cf., Figure 4). Secondly, the 
M-13CH213CH2- 
resonances are expected to be broadened by 
13C-13C scalar and unremoved dipolar coupling (vide supra).36 
Thirdly, 
diffraction 
structural, 
NMR spectroscopic, and theoretical 
results indicate that Cp’,AnR2 complexes occupy a very shallow 
potential energy surface for deformations of the Th-C(a)-C(B) 
valence angles.6d*s2b*53 
Such distortions are frequently accom- 
panied by C(a)H “agostic“ interactions, (e.g., J). For NMR 
M-C- 
J 
spectroscopy, solid-state 
613C(a) 
parameters can therefore occur 
over a surprisingly broad spectral range and C(a) nonequivalences 
are common in Cp’,ThR2 CPMAS s p e ~ t r a . ~ ~ ~ . ~ ~  
A relevant 
example containing an n alkyl group is that of Cp’,Th(n-C4Hg), 
(Figure 12,35a 
Table I). Assignment of the solution spectrum 
follows straightforwardly from 13C{’HJ 
and coupled spectra: 6

(d) This equation has been derived for a transferless and 
terminationless living polymerization in the ‘slow initiation” regime. Con- 
sidering the substantial polydispersities observed in most heterogeneous 
ethylene polymerization processes,’ the present working assumption that in- 
itiation and propagation are described by single rate constants is clearly an 
approximation.

122.2 (Cp’-C), 89.2 (Th-CH3), 31.4, 31.1 (C(8) and C(a)), 14.4 
(C(b)), and 11.2 (Cp’-CH,). The major difference in the CPMAS 
spectrum (Figure 12B) 
is the large magnetic nonequivalence 
observed for the C(a) resonances, viz., 6 81.0 and 93.8. Similar 
effects are observe in Cp’,Th[CH,C(CH3)3]2 
(A6 = 26) and 
Cp’,Th[CH2Si(CHJ3J2 
(A6 = 27) and are associated with major 
solid-state structural distortions (e.g., J).6d*S2b This behavior 
suggests that the Th-C(a) resonances of surface-bound Th- 
(13CH213CH2),,CH3 
species are likely to occur over a broad spectral 
range, reflecting the modest energies required for Th-C(a)-C(B) 
deformation, differing n values, and the heterogeneity. 
Supported organoactinide hydrides are also active olefin hy- 
drogenation and polymerization  catalyst^.'^ That the surface 
chemistry is similar to that of the supported hydrocarbyls is verified 
by CPMAS studies of [Cp’zTh(p-H)H]z/MgClz. 
The spectrum 
of the supported complex is essentially identical with that of 
Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12 
except for the absence of Th-I3CH3 and 
Mg-I3CH3 signals (Table I). Dosing with ethylene gives rise to 
the characteristic 
signatures of polyethylene (Figure 1 3)3sa 
minus, 
of course, the strong PE-I3CH3 resonance previously observed at 
6 12 (Figure IO). In work to be reported elsewhere,ss 
we show 
that ‘H 
MAS NMR spectroscopy is an effective method to detect 
surface-bound organoactinide hydrides and to monitor their 
chemical transformations. 
Additional Adsorbate Chemistry. Hydrogenolytic transfor- 
mations of actinide-alkyl bonds are important in both olefin 
hydrogenation4 
and, for molecular weight control, in polymeri- 
zation catalysis. Exposing Cp’,Th( 13CH3),/DA samples to large 
molar excesses of H, at temperatures up to 100 “C for a period 
of several hours effects no 
perceptible changes in the CPMAS 
spectrum. This result agrees excellently with the low percentage 
of active olefin hydrogenation sites inferred from poisoning 
st~dies.’~*~ 
We estimate that <lo f 
10% of the Th-CH3 or 
AI-CH3 
sites undergo hydrogenolysis under these conditions. In 
contrast, exposure of Cp’2Th(13CH3)2/MgC12 
to excess Hz 
at room 
temperature for 1 h (Figure 14) results in diminution of both the 
Th-13CH3 and Mg-13CH3 signals, with the former decaying 
slightly more rapidly. Interestingly, samples exhibiting a sig- 
nificant Cp’,Th(l3CH3)@ resonance at 6 = 
60 
respond differently 
in that hydrogenolytic diminution of the 6 = 70 Cp’,ThCH3+ 
resonance is not accompanied by a significant decay of the p-oxo 
Th-13CH3 signal. This additional example of lower surface 
Cp’,Th(CH,)O- reactivity is again in accord with the solution 
chemistry of these less electrophilic ~pecies.’~J’ 
That the chemistry 
of Figure 148 indeed generates reactive surface hydrides is con- 
firmed by the observation that exposure of such samples to ethylene 
results in the formation of polyethylene (Figure 14C). 
The potency of CO as a poison of Cp’,Th(CH3)z/support 
catalytic activity promoted studies with this reagent. The reaction 
of Cp’zTh(CH3)2/MgClz 
with 1 equiv of 13C0 
(CO/Th = 1) is 
quantitative by manometry; however, no 
new 13CO-derived 
fea- 
tures are evident in the d -50-489 region of the CPMAS spectrum. 
In contast, exposure of Cp’2Th(’3CH3)2/MgC12 
to 1 equiv of either 
CO or I3CO results in a nearly identical spectrum with disap- 
pearance of the Th-I3CH3 signal, no change in the Cp%, 
Cp’-CH3, or Mg-I3CH3 resonances, and two new features of 
approximately equal intensity at 6 31 and 6 17 (Figure 1 
5).3s8 No 
other resonances are observed in the 6 -50-489 spectral region. 
Although the interpretation of these changes is not unambiguous, 
note that typical organothorium dihaptoacyl (K) 
chemical shifts 
are -6 350 (-*3C(0)CH3) 
and -6 30 (-C(0)13CH3)6b,37*4s*M*s7

a sample exposed to 15 equiv of propylene (6 h at 25 “C) reveals 
almost complete disappearance of of Th-I3CH3

posure of this sample to H2

large quantities of propane and propylene, but no 
detectable C4 
products (isobutane, isobutylene, n-butane, etc.). Higher propylene 
oligomers would not be detected in this assay. Treatment with 
water also failed to evolve C4 
products. These results are in accord 
with the aforementioned NMR spectroscopic evidence (Figure 
16A)3Sa 
for some residual surface methyl groups. Since the support 
was likely to have adsorbed propylene during the initial propylene 
dosing and since Cp’,Th(CH3)2/MgClz 
is a propylene hydro- 
genation catalyst? nothing about an v3-allyl (eq 
5 )  can be inferred 
from the C3 
products. However, the absence of isobutane argues

CPMAS NMR Spectroscopic Study o

 Organoactinides 
against significant Th-CH3 
single step insertion chemistry (e& 
eq 6). However, the NMR feature at -6 25 is conceivably a 
( 6) 
I3CH3 
end group of a propylene oligomer which would not have 
been detected in the trapping/GC assays (cf., 6 22.5 in solid 
isotactic and 6 21 .O in solid syndiotactic polypropylene60s61). 
Cp’2Ln(r13-allyl) 
and Cp’,Ln(isobutyl) compounds are known to 
undergo propylene insertion (in competition with allylic C-H 
activation) to yield propylene  oligomer^.^^^^ Further support for 
the importance of allylic C-H functionalities here is provided by 
the observation that prolonged exposure of Cp’,Th(l3CH3),/MgCI2 
to 3,3’-dimethylbutene has no effect on the CPMAS spectrum 
(eq 7). 
(7) 
Additional information on the Cp’,Th(i3CH3)2/MgC12 + 
propylene reaction is provided by studies with propylene 60% 13C 
labeled in the C-2 position. The CPMAS spectrum (Figure 
1 
6B)3Sa 
reveals a multiplicity of resonances in the 8 20-70 and 
6 120-1 50 regions. The most straightforward interpretation is 
in terms of repetitive propylene insertion by a surface q3-allyl (M) 
to yield a mixture of oligomers (eq

that an q3-allyl can be regenerated via a competing processs9 
analogous to eq 5), end group, and stereo- and possibly regi- 
oregularity. Thus, spectral features in the 6 140-155 region can 
be assigned to C2 resonances of an q3-allyl (6 147.3 and 8 153.3 
in solid Cp’Th(.r13-C3HS)23*62) 
or to the C2 carbon of an olefinic 
end group (cf., eq 8; 6 140-145 in analogous olefins63). The 
resonance at -6 60 
is assigned to an unreactive Cp’,Th(13CH3)O- 
species, while the signals in the 820-45 region must be due, 
predominantly, to labeled positons of propylene oligomers. Note 
that methine resonances in regioirregular polypropylenes fall in 
the range -6 28.3-38.5 in 
It is conceivable that lower 
molecular weights, different chain folding on the surface, olefin 
isomerization, and possible chemisorptive interactions with the 
surface8 would increase the chemical shift dispersion further. 
Conclusions 
The results of this chemical/spectroscopic investigation con- 
siderably amplify what is known about organoactinide hydrocarbyl 
adsorbate structure and reactivity. Connections 
have been drawn 
between catalysis and spectroscopy which also convey implications 
for other adsorbed hydrocarbyl systems.’ 
Basically, three CPMAS spectroscopic patterns are observed 
for supported actinide hydrocarbyls. O

Cp’,Th(CH3)+BPh4- and Cp’,Th(CH,)(THF),+BPH< 
l3 suggest 
‘cation-like” character. The present work shows this pattern is 
generalizable to other supports (MgCI,, DSA), complexes 
(Cp’ThR3, Cp3ThR), and hydrocarbyl groups (ethyl, benzyl). 
From NMR experiments using paramagnetic U(IV) probes, it 
can be surmised that the great majority of Cp’,Th(CH3),-derived 
adsorbate molecules on both DA and MgCl, are not p-alkyls (E) 
but rather the transferred surface alkyl moiety is 5 5  
8, displaced 
from the actinide center. The second type of CPMAS pattern 
is observed on hydroxylated supports (PDA, PDS, MgO) where 
it is known’ that extensive An-R protonolysis occurs. Here, the 
Th-I3C(a)H2R resonance is at considerably higher field (in the 
region of Cp’,Th(CH3)O-type complexes), and no transferred 
surface alkyl group is evident. A “poxo-like” structure (B, C) 
is suggested for these adsorbates. Traces of these structures are 
occasionally observed on Lewis acid supports and provide an 
interesting reactivity comparison. The third type of spectroscopic 
pattern is observed on dehydroxylated supports without strong 
Lewis acid character and having relatively weak surface metal- 
oxygen bonds (DS, portions of the DSA surface). Here both a 
“p-oxo-like” Th-13C(a)H2R resonance and a transferred surface 
alkyl resonance are observed, suggesting a structure such as D. 
Paramagnetic probes indicate that the majority of the surface alkyl 
groups are 5 5  
8, from the actinide center. 
In regard to heterogeneous olefin hydrogenation and polym- 
erization catalysis, the present NMR results add considerably to 
the structure-catalytic activity picture that is emerging. Im- 
portantly, significant catalytic activity is only observed in systems 
exhibiting “cation-like” spectral signatures1IcJ3 
(and metal alkyl 
or hydride bonds to effect the catalysis), while negligible activity 
is observed in systems exhibiting only “p-oxo-like” (Cp’,Th- 
(CH3)0-) spectral  feature^.^^^.'^ Moreover, “p-oxo-like” species 
do not display significant reactivity in direct competition with 
‘cation-like” species on the same surface. These reactivity trends 
accord well with solution chemical e x p e c t a t i o n ~ . ~ J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Fur- 
thermore, the fractions of surface organoactinide complexes re- 
active in stoichiometric dosing experiments monitored by NMR 
are in good agreement with percentages of active sites assayed 
by catalytic CO and/or H 2 0  
poisoning  experiment^.^^,^ Thus, 
only -4% of Cp’,Th(CH,),/DA sites are important in propylene 
hydrogenation and ethylene polymerization as deduced by catalytic 
pois~ning,’~?~ 
while the present NMR studies evidence ethylene 
polymerization by a fraction of sites below the detection limit 
(Figure 9; 510% 
of the total) and response to hydrogenolysis at 
the same level. In contrast, 35 f 
10% 
of Cp’,Th(CH3),/MgC12 
sites are found to be significant for propylene hydrogenation by 
catalytic poisoning,78 
while the present NMR studies show 50 f 
10% of the observed sites active for ethylene insertion (Figures 
10 and 11) and a comparable or larger percentage reactive with 
respect to hydrogenolysis (Figure 14). 
The gross structural formulation for alkyl-transferred surface 
sites as “cation-like” (A) follows from chemical, structural, and 
spectroscopic analogies to solution chemistry.I3J4 Not surprisingly, 
the chemical properties of a particular “cation-like” adsorbate are 
expected to be highly dependent upon the characteristics of the 
local counterion-in 
this case, the local support microstructure. 
This surface is not expected to be topologically uniform8 and it 
is likely, depending upon the bulk support structure and local 
heterogeneities, that different adsorbate sites will experience 
different counterion/surface interactions. The present results for 
spectroscopically “cation-like” Cp’2Th(CH3)2/DA 
and Cp’,Th- 
(CH3),/MgC1, adsorbates underscore this point, and solu- 
tion12,’3*64*6s

Abstract: Halide ion abstraction from the neutral iridiacyclopentadiene complexes, I;(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2Cl 
(1, R 
= C02CH3), 
and Ir(CR=CRCRkR)(PPh,),(CO)(CI) 
(2, R = C02CH3), 
leads to high yields of the cationic complexes, 
Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh,),(L)(L’)+BF,- (3, L = CO, L’ = H 2 0  
4, L = CO, L’ = NCCH3; 5, L = L’ = NCCH,; and 
6, L = CO, L’ = PMe,). Reaction of complex I and 3-butyn-1-01 generates the first example of a metallacycle-carbene 
complex 
Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2(Cl)[=C(CH2)30] 
(7; 
81%). Similarly, reaction of 3 
or 4 and 3-butyn-1-01 
leads to formation 
of the carbene complex Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2(CO)[=C(CH2)30]+BF4- 
(8; 96%). Reaction of 4 and 4-pentyn-2-01 
gives a 95% yield of the substituted carbene complex Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2(CO)[=C(CH2)2CHCH30]+BF4- 
(9). 
The acetonitrile analogues, Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2(NCCH3)[=C(CH2)30]+BF4- 
(10) and Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)- 
( 
PPh3)2(NCCH3) 
[=C(CH2)2CHCH30]+BF,- (1 
I), are also prepared in excellent yield. The bis(carbene) complex Ir- 
(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2[=C(CH2)30]2+BF4- 
(12) is available in one step from 5 (87%). The mixed bis(carbene) complex 
Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3)2[=C(CH2)2CHCH30] 
[=C(CH2)30]+BF4- 
(13) is prepared from 7 
by sequential reaction with 
AgBF, and 4-pentyn-2-01. Complex 8 crystallizes in space group Cc, with a = 12.723 (2) A, b = 21.195 (4) A, c = 18.432

Pi, with a = 12.951 (2) A, b = 13.371 (2) A, c = 18.071 (4) A, (Y = 78.42 (2)0,

( I )  A’, Z = 2, R(F) = 4.35%, 
R,(F) = 4.87%. Reaction of compounds 8 and 9 with pyridine gives the pyridinium-substituted 
acyl complexes lr(CR-CRCR=CR)(PPh3),(CO)[C(=O)CH,CH2CH2NC5H5]+BF4- 
(14) and Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)- 
(PPh3)2(CO)[C(=O)CH$H2CH(CH3)NC,HSI+BFi 
(17). Methylamine and bis(oxacyc1opentylidene) complex 12 give a 
nearly quantitative yield of the iridium hydride complex Ir(CR=CRCR=CR)(PPh3),(NH2CH3)(H) 
(19), CH3NH3+BF4-, 
and 2-(2(5H)-furanylidene)tetarhydrofuran (20; 92%). The mixed bis(carbene) complex 13 undergoes 
reaction with methylamine 
to give iridium hydride 19 and the carbene coupling products 2-(2(5H)-furanylidene)-5-methyltetrahydrofuran (24; 45%) and 
2-(2(5-methyl)furanylidene)tetrahydrofuran (25; 5
5
%
)
.
 Iridium hydride 19 reacts with HCI to regenerate 1 
and with HBF4 
in acetonitrile to regenerate the bis(carbene) precursor 5. The mechanism of this novel carbene ligand coupling chemistry 
is discussed.
