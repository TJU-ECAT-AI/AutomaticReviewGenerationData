A molecular level 
mechanism 
is proposed for the highly selective 14-e- oxidative transfor- 
mation of 
n-butane to maleic 
anhydride on the surface 
ofvanadyl 
pyrophosphate. The mechan- 
ism suggests 
that the dimeric active sites assume at any given time, 
one of four possible inter- 
convertible 
states which 
differ 
from each other in the number of 
available 
oxygen 
atoms and the 
formal oxidation states of the individual vanadium atoms. The relative ratios of active sites 
in each of the four possible 
states are dictated by the reaction conditions, the redox properties 
of the reacting gases and the structure of the vanadyl pyrophosphate active surface. A crucial 
feature of the mechanism is a "pseudo-ozonide" surface species 
formed by the interaction of 
a chemisorbed dioxygen molecule and an adjacent metal-oxo group. This unusual species 
is responsible for the initial activation of the n-butane, which occurs when the chemisorbed 
dioxygen abstracts an H-atom from the alkane and the adjacent metal-oxo group reacts 
with the incipient alkyl radical to form an alkoxy group. The proposed mechanism is entirely 
consistent with literature reports describing the behaviour of (VO)2P207 in flow, pulse and 
TAP reactors.

1. Introduction 
Over the past two decades, intensive studies in both academic and industrial 
laboratories have shed considerable light on the title reaction and the nature of the 
catalyst performing this remarkably selective, 14-electron oxidative transforma- 
tion of n-butane to maleic anhydride [1,2]. There are several hypothetical mechan- 
istic schemes that have been proposed to describe this system at the molecular 
level [3,4], however, they differ considerably from each other and no comprehen- 
sive scheme has yet been formulated that would describe the surface state dynamics 
of the catalyst during the complete redox reaction cycle, as has been done in great 
detail for the propylene oxidation and ammoxidation on Bi-molybdates and Fe- or 
U-antimonates [5].

Recently, Thompson and Ebner [6] reexamined the crystal structure of the 
active phase, (VO)2P207, of these highly selective paraffin oxidation catalysts and 
postulated a detailed "zeroth-order" model of the topology of the catalytically 
active surface, which is formed by terminating the crystal parallel to the (100) plane 
[7]. The "site-isolation" principle, first proposed by Grasselli and Callahan [8], 
which requires that the active oxygen on the surface of the selective 
catalyst be pres- 
ent in isolated regions, is one of the key features of their model. Although it is clear 
that subsurface, i.e. lattice, oxygen does not play a dominant role in this reaction, 
the exact chemical form of the active oxygen involved in the reaction is still uncer- 
tain [9]. 
Based on an analysis of the electronic structure of the vanadyl pyrophosphate 
surface using extended Hiickel calculations, Schiott et al. [10] suggested that 
1,3-butadiene, assumed to form from n-butane by some mechanism involving the 
initial abstraction of a methylene 
hydrogen [11], undergoes a [4 + 2]-like concerted 
cycloaddition reaction with an oxygen atom of a vanadyl group on the surface, 
and the thus formed adsorbed 2,5-dihydrofuran species is transformed to maleic 
anhydride by reaction with molecular dioxygen adsorbed on the adjacent Lewis 
acidic vanadium atom. 
We report now some experimental results supporting a key feature of this incom- 
plete mechanism, viz. that molecular dioxygen is an obligatory oxidant in the 
highly selective transformation of n-butane to maleic anhydride on the surface 
of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst. However, the main thrust of our paper is a 
proposed detailed molecular level mechanism, which describes step-by-step, the 
surface dynamics involving redox transformations of the active sites during the 
14-electron oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride. This newly proposed 
mechanism can be used to explain a large number of experimental observations 
reported to date on this system.

2.1. CATALYST 
SYNTHESIS 
Preparation of VO(HP04). 1 HeO [12]. V205 (100 g, 0.55 mol) was refluxed in 
isobutanol (1 g) for 20 h. Tetraethoxysilane (122 g, 0.59 tool) was then added fol- 
lowed by phosphoric acid (85% w/w, 150 g, 1.30 mol). The mixture was then stirred 
and refluxed for 14 h and allowed to cool. The light blue precipitate was collected 
by filtration through a medium pore glass frit. The XRD pattern, fig. 1, showed 
that this was the precursor phase VO(HPO4).IH20. The surface area, determined 
by N2 BET measurements, was found to be ,,~ 24 m 2 g-1.

was mixed with Tiz(CzO4)3.10H20, oxalic acid (5 g) and water (200 ml). 
The slurry was stirred and evaporated to dryness. The residue was then ground 
and heated at 500~ 
for 10 h. A solution of Co(NO3)2.6H20 (1.05 g) and 
(NHa)6Mo7024.H20 (0.65 g) in 25 ml of water was then added and the mixture eva- 
porated to dryness. The residue was ground and heated to 550~ for 3 h. The light 
purple product was used without any further treatment. The surface area, deter- 
mined by N2 BET measurements, was found to be ~ 24 m 2 g-1. 
2.2. REACTION APPARATUS 
The catalysts prepared as described above were evaluated in a standard fixed-

pyrophosphate 
bed microreactor unit. The analysis of the product stream was performed using an 
on-line Varian model 3600 GC and a Carle refinery gas analyser. The product 
stream was maintained at > 220~ until it had passed through the sampling loop of 
the Varian GC. A large diameter (6.0 cm) air-cooled trap in-line immediately after 
the Varian GC was found to be an effective way of avoiding the clogging of the sys- 
tem by the solid maleic anhydride. 
2.3. DATA ANALYSIS 
The composition of the feed was adjusted to approximate 1.5% n-C4 in air, 
which is below the lower explosion limit for this mixture. The conversions are 
defined as the molar percentage of each reactant in the feed that is converted to 
products. The yields of carbon containing products are defined as the percentage of 
carbon in the butane converted that is present in each of these products. The selec- 
tivity to each product is defined as the ratio of the yield of that product divided by 
butane conversion. The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen balances were 
100 + 5% and all results were normalized assuming no loss of carbon. Blank runs 
conducted over acid-washed quartz chips under conditions similar to the actual 
experimental runs showed no reaction. Blank runs were also conducted to establish 
that nitrous oxide is not decomposed over any of the catalysts in the temperature 
range 400-500

3. Results 
The precursor phase prepared as described above was pelleted to 20-40 mesh 
size, loaded in the quartz microreactor and converted to the active phase, vanadyl 
pyrophosphate, in situ by heating to 400~ with the feed gas consisting of ,-~ 1.5% 
n-butane in a ~ 20/80 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen flowing over it at a rate of 
100 ml min 
-1 . The X-ray powder diffraction patterns (Cu Ka radiation) of the 
precursor phase and the equilibrated catalyst unloaded from the reactor after the 
catalytic experiments are shown in fig. 1. The catalyst bed volume was ~ 2.6 ml, 
thus giving a contact time of,-~ 1.5 s. The only products observed were maleic anhy- 
dride and carbon oxides. The stability of the catalyst was monitored during the 
course of the experiments described below by periodically returning to these initial 
conditions and determining the n-butane conversion and the product distribution. 
After the catalyst had equilibrated about 80 h on stream, the feed gas composition 
was changed to ~ 1.5% n-butane in a 40 : 60 v/v mixture of N20 and N2, and the 
product stream analyzed as described above. The feed gas composition was then 
switched back to the original composition and the products again analyzed to con- 
firm that the catalyst was still active under the normal operating conditions. This 
complete set of experiments was also conducted at 450~ and similar experiments 
were also performed under comparable conditions after changing the catalyst to (i)

50% V205/SIO2 and (ii) 10% CoMoO4/TiO2. The latter is one of the few catalysts 
for maleic anhydride synthesis from n-butane that does not contain vanadium [13]. 
The n-butane conversions over the three catalysts when molecular oxygen is the oxi- 
dant are plotted together in fig. 2, while fig. 3 shows a plot of the conversions 
observed when nitrous oxide is the oxidant. 
4. Discussion 
The active surface of vanadyl pyrophosphate consists of dimeric units formed 
by edge-sharing between two square-pyramidal VO5 groups, with the apical oxy- 
gen atoms of the two groups pointing in opposite directions, so that on the surface, 
each dimeric unit has one metal-oxo group adjacent to a strong Lewis acid site. 
These active sites are linked together by phosphorus atoms to form layers that in 
turn are linked together by P-O-P linkages to form the three-dimensional structure 
of (VO)2P207. The layers are aligned so that the vanadyl groups form pairs of 
V=O- -V=O chains pointing in opposite directions perpendicular to the surface. 
The dimeric active sites form clusters on the surface, composed each of four vana- 
dium dimers, that are isolated from each other by excess phosphorus, present in the 
form of pyrophosphate groups, as shown schematically in fig. 4. These pyrophos- 
phate groups serve as diffusion barriers, preventing excess oxygen from neighbour-

Fig. 3. Conversion of n-butane over three different catalysts at 400 and 450~ and contact times of

CoMoOa/TiO2 are about half to a third of those observed when the oxidant is dioxygen. However, 
over (VO)2P207, the n-butane conversion 
is essentially 
zero. This difference 
in behavior between oxi- 
des in which bulk diffusion of lattice oxygen is possible and (VO)2P207 in which such diffusion is 
not possible, is consistent with our hypothesis 
that molecular oxygen

vation of

used catalyst, (VO)zP207. 
ing clusters reaching the reactive surface bound intermediates and thus help pre- 
vent overoxidation [14]. They are also Bronsted acid sites and participate in the 
overall reaction, as described below. 
The mechanism we propose for the selective oxidative transformation of 
n-butane to maleic anhydride on the (100) face of the (VO)2P20 7 crystallites, sug- 
gests that each of the four dimeric active sites per geometrically isolated surface 
cluster can assume the four distinct states So, $1, $2 and $3 described below. The 
clusters of four active sites are diffusionally isolated from the rest of the surface by 
the pyrophosphate groups, as described above, and chemisorbed oxygen can hop 
from site to site within each cluster, possibly aided by an intervening phosphate 
group, transforming the state of the active sites involved. 
We denote the virginal state of the active site by $1, since it has one available oxy- 
gen atom associated with it. When a molecule of dioxygen is adsorbed on the Lewis 
acid site, the active site is transformed to a state denoted by $3. This chemisorbed 
dioxygen could either be a superoxo or a peroxo species [15], however, even though 
extended Hiickel calculations favour the peroxo form by ~ 0.5 eV [10], the super- 
oxo species might still be the predominant form if it is stabilized to some extent by 
interaction with the adjacent metal-oxo atom. Two additional possible states that

the active sites can assume, are denoted by S0 and $2, with zero and two oxygen 
atoms respectively. The structure of the active site in each of these four states is 
shown in fig. 5, with formal oxidation numbers assigned to each vanadium atom. 
Further, according to our proposed mechanism, the initial activation of the 
n-butane is accomplished by hydrogen abstraction from one of the methylene 
groups of n-butane by a superoxo species to give a surface bound hydroperoxy 
group, and simultaneously the capture of the alkyl radical by the adjacent vanadyl 
group to give a surface bound alkoxy group. The hydroperoxy group can then 
rapidly abstract another hydrogen, from either the same methylene group or from 
one of the adjacent -CHx groups, to generate a molecule of water and a metal 
bound ketaloxy or glycoloxy group respectively, as shown in fig. 6. The surface spe- 
cies formed as a result of this step can also be considered to be 2-butanone and 
1- or 2-butene, strongly adsorbed on the active site in state $1 or $2 respectively. 
In a TAP reactor [16], due to the extremely low pressure conditions, the butenes can 
desorb and exit the catalyst bed without undergoing further reaction and therefore 
be observed as the primary product [9]. Under normal operating conditions, how- 
ever, the butenes do not desorb as observable intermediates, staying on the surface 
to react further. 
The mechanism we propose suggests that the next step in the sequence of reac- 
tions leading to maleic anhydride formation involves the participation of a 
Bronsted acid site. There is considerable evidence to support this idea, e.g. Aguero

Fig. 5. Schematic representations of the structure of the dimeric active site in the various dynamic 
states that it can assume during the course of 
the reaction of 
n-butane with molecular oxygen 
to form 
maleic anhydride. In $3 and $2 the dimeric active site may undergo one- or two-electron oxidation 
by the adsorbed dioxygen or atomic oxygen. We propose a one-electron oxidation in state $3 and a 
two-electron 
oxidation in state $2. 
et al. [17] observed that neopentane, which has only three contiguous carbon 
atoms in the chain, can be converted to maleic anhydride in high yields, a result that 
can be explained on the basis of the participation of Bronsted acid sites in the 
mechanism of the reaction. In addition, Centi et al. [18] reported recently that dop- 
ing the surface of active vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst with potassium selec- 
tively removes the Bronsted acid sites while leaving the Lewis acid sites unaffected. 
This K-doped catalyst is unable to convert n-butane to maleic anhydride, how- 
ever, it can activate n-butane and generate surface bound species of unknown struc- 
ture, which are slowly oxidized to COx in the presence of gaseous oxygen. 
According to the mechanism we propose these surface bound species are mainly 
intermediates such as butenes and butanones which, on an undoped catalyst sur- 
face, can all be converted to 1,3-butadiene and one molecule of water by acid cata- 
lyzed reactions [19], as shown in fig. 7. Thus though there are several alternate 
intermediates possible in the early stages of the reaction of n-butane, as described 
above, the observed selectivity towards the final product, maleic anhydride, is very

Fig. 6. Surface species generated by the reaction of n-butane with the active site in state S3. The initial 
activation of the n-butane occurs by hydrogen abstraction from a methylene group to give a surface 
bound hydroperoxy group. The adjacent vanadyl group simultaneously captures the alkyl radical to 
form a surface bound alkoxy group. The hydroperoxy group can abstract a hydrogen, either a or 13, 
from the alkoxy group to generate water and either of the two surface bound species shown above. 
These can be seen to be respectively, 2-butanone chemisorbed on the active site in state S], or

high. As a result of the acid catalyzed step, 1,3-butadiene is produced and the 
active site returns to state $1. Again in a TAP reactor, 1,3-butadiene is able to de- 
sorb and exit the catalyst bed, and is observed as the secondary product. The course 
of the reaction beyond this point has been considered and described in detail on 
the basis of extended Hiickel calculations [20]. 
At the end of this sequence of elementary reactions, when maleic anhydride is 
desorbed from the surface, the active site is in state So. In this state it can react with 
dioxygen to from state S2 or it could also accept an oxygen atom from an adjacent 
site in state $2 to form state $1. If there are two adjacent sites in state S2, transfer 
of oxygen atom from one to the other leads to the formation of one site in state S~ 
and one site in state $3. The pathways for the interconversion of the various states 
of each active site and the substrate reactions that accompany them are shown in 
fig. 8a. A minimum of three active sites is needed to complete the transformation of 
n-butane to maleic anhydride in the absence of gaseous oxygen [21], however, a 
fourth site is needed in order to regenerate the original state of the catalyst. A sim- 
ple model of the surface dynamics [22] of vanadyl pyrophosphate can be written 
in terms of the proposed isolated cluster of four active sites, and is given in fig. 8b. 
The mechanism suggests that oxidants which can provide only one oxygen

Fig. 7. Acid catalyzed conversion of partially oxidized surface bound intermediates to 1,3- 
butadiene. The active site is first converted to state Sl which is capable therefore of adsorbing a mole- 
cule of dioxygen and therefore is converted to state $3. The 1,3-butadiene formed stays strongly 
adsorbed on the active site by interacting with the oxygen of the vanadyl group and undergoes further 
reaction to yield maleic anhydride. 
atom at a time to the active site, would not be good alkane oxidants over vanadyl 
pyrophosphate. Thus, nitrous oxide would form structures similar to $2 which are 
much less reactive than $3, the surface state derived directly by the interaction of 
gaseous dioxygen with the surface. However, the difference in the reactivity of 
dioxygen and nitrous oxide with alkanes over other metal oxides in which subsur- 
face bulk oxygen is also available for reaction would not be as great as in 
(VO)2P207, since in the former an oxygen depleted i.e. reduced, active site is readily 
replenished with oxygen from the bulk and not necessarily from the gas phase [5]. 
Our results, which are summarized in figs. 2 and 3, are consistent with the 
mechanism we propose. In fig. 2, it is seen that under comparable conditions, 
n-butane is converted to approximately the same extent by all three catalysts inves- 
tigated, albeit with vastly different selectivity to maleic anhydride, when molecular 
oxygen is the oxidant. In contrast, fig. 3 shows that when nitrous oxide is the oxi- 
dant, n-butane conversion drops to < 1% over the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst

Fig. 8. (a) Transformation pathways linking the four distinct states of the active site and the asso- 
ciated substrate reactions. (b) Surface dynamics of conversion of n-butane to maleic anhydride on one 
four-fold cluster of active sites on (VO)2P207. 
(i.e. a reduction in yield of at least 30-70 fold) but drops only by a factor of ~ 2-3 
over the V205 and CoMoO4 catalysts. However, it is important to note that while 
at longer n-butane contact times even nitrous oxide is capable of supporting 
n-butane oxidation over vanadyl pyrophosphate, (e.g. at 450~ and ~ 3.5 s con- 
tact time, the n-butane conversion was ~ 18%) the selectivity to maleic anhydride is 
much lower (~ 30%). This is consistent with our postulate that the active site can 
be ultimately transformed from state $2 to state $3 by activated diffusion of the 
adsorbed oxygen atoms. 
We considered several alternate explanations of our results but found them to 
be unsatisfactory. For example, we found no decomposition of nitrous oxide to 
nitrogen and dioxygen over any of the three catalysts that we tested, thus the differ- 
ence in n-butane conversion could not have its origins in the difference in reactivity 
of the nitrous oxide itself. We also found that the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst 
was not greatly altered, when it was placed in an atmosphere containing nitrous 
oxide instead of oxygen since its selectivity to maleic anhydride was essentially the 
350 
P.A. Agaskar et al. / n-butane oxidation over vanadylpyrophosphate 
same before and after the experiment and the XRD-pattern of the V-P-O catalyst 
at the end of this series of experiments showed that it was essentially pure phase 
(VO)2P207. 
5. Conclusions 
We compared the efficacy of molecular oxygen and nitrous oxide, N20, as oxi- 
dants for the oxidation of n-butane over (VO)2P207, 50% V205/SIO2 and 10% 
CoMoO4/TiO2. The results reveal that both these gases readily, but not selectively, 
oxidize n-butane over V2Os and CoMoO4. In marked contrast, only molecular oxy- 
gen, effectively and with high selectivity, oxidizes n-butane to maleic anhydride 
over (VO)2P207, while N20 does not oxidize n-butane at all over this catalyst. 
We interpret this result in terms of a new mechanism which we have formulated 
to model the dynamics of the highly selective conversion of n-butane to maleic 
anhydride on the surface ofvanadyl pyrophosphate. According to this mechanism, 
each dimeric active site on the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst can 
assume four distinct states that differ from each other in the number and nature of 
the available oxygen. The active sites are isolated in clusters of four by the presence 
of excess phosphorus, present on the surface in the form of pyrophosphate groups 
that serve as diffusion barriers to prevent excess oxygen from reaching the reactive 
surface bound intermediates. The initial step of n-butane activation involves a 
"pseudo-ozonide" structure formed from a vanadyl group and a dioxygen mole- 
cule chemisorbed on an adjacent vanadium atom. This unusual species is responsi- 
ble for the initial activation of the n-butane, which occurs when the chemisorbed 
dioxygen abstracts an H-atom from the alkane and the adjacent metal-oxo group 
reacts with the incipient alkyl radical to form an alkoxy group. Subsequent trans- 
formations of the surface bound intermediates involve the participation of dioxy- 
gen adsorbed on adjacent sites. Dioxygen is thus an obligatory oxidant in this very 
selective reaction.
