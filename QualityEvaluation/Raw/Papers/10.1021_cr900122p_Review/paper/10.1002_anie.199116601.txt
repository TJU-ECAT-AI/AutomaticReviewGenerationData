Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Oxides: 
Selective Catalytic Low-Temperature 
Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes by a Highly 
Electrophilic Zirconium Hydride Complex 
Supported on Silica 
By Christine Lecuyer, Francoise Quignard, Ag&s Choplin, 
Danielle Olivier, and Jean-Marie Basset * 
The electrophilic activation of the C-H bond of alkanes 
on do 
complexes of early transition metals (groups 111-VI), 
lanthanides, and actinides is now well documented.['] How- 
ever, if one excludes H/D exchange between methane and 
deuterium,"' no catalytic reaction involving a C-H activa- 
tion step has been reported so far with do 
metals. We report 
here the catalytic properties of a zirconium hydride support- 
ed on silica for the hydrogenolysis of neopentane, isobutane, 
and propane; the reaction forms isobutane, propane, and 
ethane respectively, together with methane. 
Reaction of tetraneopentylzirconium ([ZrNp,]) with the 
surface of silica previously dehydroxylated at 500 "C leads to 
the surface complex [(

which has been char- 
acterized by elemental analysis, 13C

dride 2 is obtained when 1 is reacted with molecular hydro-

[**I The financial support of the consortium ACTANE (Centre National de la 
aqueous KOH.15] Although this surface species is not yet 
fully characterized, the structure [( +SiO),ZrH] can be tenta- 
tively assigned to 2. The only gaseous products detected on 
formation of 2 are methane and ethane. Therefore under 
these conditions, the neopentyl ligand, or the neopentane 
initially produced by cleavage of the neopentyl-zirconium 
bond, has undergone hydrogenolysis to yield as final prod- 
ucts methane and ethane. 
In effect, above 50 "C 2 catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of 
alkanes such as neopentane, isobutane, and propane. At 
50 "C, 
neopentane (pNpH 
= 
40 torr, pH2 
= 230 torr) is totally 
converted in 100 hours. Up to a level of 50 % conversion,

higher conversion, isobutane is transformed into methane 
and propane, and the propane is subsequently transformed 
into methane and ethane. Interestingly, ethane does not un- 
dergo any significant further hydrogenolysis: this must have 
a mechanistic implication. Traces of 2-methylbutane are ob- 
served during the hydrogenolysis of neopentane. 
When the reaction is performed at higher temperatures 
(e.g. 100 "C), the rate of hydrogenolysis is higher, but an 
increase in secondary reactions of the first-formed alkanes is 
observed: isobutane gives propane and methane and subse- 
quently ethane and methane (Fig. 2). Hydrogenolysis of 
isobutane and propane has been carried out independently 
at 150 "C. The results confirm the relative simplicity of the 
reaction path observed with neopentane. In particular, hy- 
drogenolysis of propane yields only methane and ethane at 
any conversion.

The surface hydride 2 is highly electrophilic: if one applies

be considered an 8-electron do 
species. Formation of molec- 
ular hydrogen and of a surface zirconium-neopentyl com- 
plex results from this first step."] 
The next step is probably a /?-methyl transfer leading to 
isobutene and a surface zirconium-methyl moiety.[". ''1 
Hydrogenolysis of this latter fragment would then lead to 
methane. Isobutane would result from the hydrogenation of 
isobutene on a surface zirconium hydride.[4c' 
Formation of 
2-methylbutane is easily explained by an anti-Markovnikov 
type addition of isobutene into the Zr-Me moiety followed 
by the hydrogenolysis of the Zr-alkyl bond. The reason why 
hydrogenolysis of ethane does not occur may be related to 
either the absence of a P-methyl group or the possible exis- 
tence of an agostic interaction with the P-hydrogen as al- 
ready observed on a scandium-ethyl fragment,'l2I or both. 
The results indicate clearly that an immobilized zirconium 
hydride is able to activate catalytically the C-H bonds of 
alkanes at low temperature, which has never been reported 
for any molecular analogue. Various reasons may be invoked 
for such a behavior: 
- the zirconium hydride is very likely an 8-electron species 
which has, to our knowledge, no equivalent in molecular 
chemistry. Molecular zirconium(rv) hydrides are generally 
stabilized by two cyclopentadienyl ligands; they are thus 
16-electron species and therefore less electrophilic than 2. 
- the extremely strong zirconium-oxygen bond which is re- 
sponsible for the strong grafting of the transition metal to 
the support, does not allow any bimolecular deactivation 
as would certainly occur with a true molecular species. 
Experimental procedure 
Silica (Aerosil Degussa, 200 m'g-') 
was dehydroxylated under vacuum 
(500 'C. 16 h, 
torr) and used in situ. [ZrNp,] was synthesized following 
published procedures [13]. [ZrNp,] was sublimed under vacuum (60 "C, 
lod4 
torr) on the freshly dehydroxylated silica; unreacted complex was re- 
moved by evacuation 
at the same temperature. 
The solid samples thus obtained 
were 1.5 wt% Zr. All gaseous reactants were carefully dried and deoxygenated 
over freshly regenerated molecular sieves (4 A) and deoxo traps. All thecatalyt- 
ic tests were carried out in a Pyrex batch reactor. The composition of the gas 
phase was followed by chromatography.
