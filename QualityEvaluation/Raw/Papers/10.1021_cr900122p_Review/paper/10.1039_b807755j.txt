The Al siting in the ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated by 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy and
QM/MM calculations. It was found that the occupation of the framework T-sites by Al and the
concentration of Al in these T-sites are neither random nor controlled by a simple rule. They
both depend on the conditions of the zeolite synthesis. At least 12 out of the 24 distinguishable
framework T-sites of ZSM-5 are occupied by Al in the set of the investigated zeolite samples.
A partial identiﬁcation of the Al sites is possible. The calculated 27Al NMR shielding values were
converted to 27Al isotropic chemical shifts using the experimental isotropic chemical shift of
60.0 ppm referenced to the aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3 and the corresponding calculated NMR
shielding of 490.0 ppm of a silicon rich (Si/Al 38) chabazite structure zeolite as a secondary
internal standard. The observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts of 50.0 and 54.7 ppm correspond to
Al atoms in the T20 and T6 sites, respectively. The pair of measured isotropic chemical shifts of
52.9 and 53.7 ppm can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair. At the low-shielding end, two assignments
are plausible. The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic chemical
shifts are reached for the assignment as follows: T24 (64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples
and that the observed isotropic chemical shifts 63.6, 62.8, and 60.0 ppm belong to T1, T17, and
T7, respectively. It follows then that T-sites T12 (60.8 ppm), T3 (61.7 ppm), and T18 (62.0 ppm)
are most likely not occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. If we assume that the calculated
isotropic chemical shifts are systematically larger than the observed ones then we can assign the
largest observed isotropic chemical shifts of 63.6 and 62.8 ppm to the least shielded T24 and
T1 sites, respectively, and 60.0 ppm to T12. Then the sites T3 (61.7 ppm), T18 (62.0 ppm), and
T17 (62.5 ppm) would be unoccupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. It was further shown that
there is no simple linear relationship between the observed 27Al isotropic chemical shifts and the
average Al–O–Si angles.

Introduction
Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates widely
used as molecular sieves and catalysts in industrial chemical
processes. In the past thirty years, attention was drawn
to ZSM-5 and other silicon-rich zeolites (with Si/Al > 12).
Their protonic forms are currently used as acid catalysts for
hydrocarbon transformations in petrochemistry.1–4 Their
transition metal exchanged forms have been discovered as
exceptional redox catalysts for nitrogen oxide abatement,5,6
and a selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by nitrous oxide.7
The species assumed to be the active sites in the mentioned
reactions, i.e. protons, metal ions and metal-oxo species, are
positively charged and compensate the negatively charged
aluminosilicate framework. Therefore the Al siting in zeolite
frameworks governs the location of the active sites as well as
their properties. This is important for both the acid catalyzed
hydrocarbon syntheses8 as well as redox reactions.9,10 Thus, Al
siting in zeolites is of crucial importance for their catalytic
behavior.
A typical feature of many silicon-rich zeolites is a high
number of crystallographically distinguishable tetrahedral
framework sites (T-sites, T = Si or Al) resulting in a high
variability of the Al siting. The very ﬁrst attempts to shed light
on the Al siting in silicon-rich zeolites were based on theore-
tical calculations of the energies of Al atoms in the distinguish-
able T-sites of these materials.11–16 The calculated energy
diﬀerences between structures with Al in diﬀerent T-sites were
small11,14,15 if the substituted structures were fully relaxed

leading to the conclusion that Al siting is either largely random
or kinetically controlled during synthesis. Larger energy diﬀer-
ences repeatedly reported in quantum mechanical cluster
studies for ZSM-5 are an artifact of geometrically constraint
cluster models with ﬁxed atoms at their boundaries.12,13,16
Diﬀraction techniques cannot distinguish between Al and Si
atoms and thus do not allow direct identiﬁcation of the Al
siting in zeolites. However, Olson et al. studied the Cs+ siting
in extraframework positions of ZSM-5 by X-ray diﬀraction
and concluded that the three observed Cs+ sites indicate a
nonrandom Al siting.17
27Al solid state NMR spectroscopy was found to be a
powerful tool for analyzing the coordination of Al atoms in
zeolites,18–20 and moreover, recent developments of multiple
quantum NMR experiments21 opened new possibilities for
studying the structure of AlO4 in zeolite frameworks. Sarv
et al.22 applied this approach to ZSM-5 and found three
diﬀerent tetrahedral Al coordinations. Investigations of the
eﬀect of Al concentration in the framework on the 27Al (MQ)
MAS NMR spectra of ZSM-523 and zeolite Beta24 indicated a
non-random Al siting in these matrices.
Key to the identiﬁcation of the Al siting in high silica
zeolites is assigning the observed 27Al resonances to individual
framework T-sites. A linear correlation between the
27Al
NMR
isotropic
chemical shift,
d(Al), and the average
T–O–T angle, y, of the zeolite framework was suggested by
Lippmaa et al.25 making reference to the correlation between
the 29Si NMR chemical shift and the average Si–O–Si angle for
which a semiempirical quantum mechanical rationalization
exists.26
Problems
arise
from
the
inability
of
X-ray
crystallography to distinguish between Al and Si atoms. The
crystallographic T–O–T angles used in the correlation corres-
ponded to the average values of the Al–O–Si and Si–O–Si
angles for the same T-sites (only partly occupied by Al) and do
not correspond to the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra. Note
that experimental studies employing this correlation did not
succeed in deriving the Al siting from the measured NMR
parameters.22–24,27–29 Therefore another approach relating
measured NMR parameters to individual T-sites is needed.
Developments in computational chemistry have allowed
calculating reasonable zeolite structures as well as NMR
parameters. Employing the GIAO-CPHF method30 Sauer
et al.31 calculated the 29Si NMR chemical shifts of all-silica
zeolite structures in good agreement with observed chemical
shifts (standard deviation of 2.8 ppm). For structures calcu-
lated with ab initio parametrized force ﬁelds32 the agreement
was slightly better than for X-ray structures. For the ortho-
rhombic structure of ZSM-5, the calculations reproduced the
correct order of all 12 observed
29Si-NMR signals. Bull
et al.33,34 used the GIAO method for calculating the 17O
isotropic chemical shifts and the electric ﬁeld gradients of
oxygen in siliceous faujasite and ferrierite. For faujasite a
complete assignment of the four observed lines was possible,
while for ferrierite only a partial assignment could be achieved.
Periodic DFT calculations brought some improvement,35 but
did not change the sequence of signals for the diﬀerent
positions.36 Kuc
ˇ era and Nachtigall37 studied the MCM-58
zeolite by periodic DFT. They found that the 27Al NMR
isotropic chemical shift of Al in the framework dramatically
varies with the coordination of the counter cation in the
cationic site and with the number of water molecules coordi-
nated to the counter cation.
In this paper, the distribution of Al atoms over the indivi-
dual T-sites of the ZSM-5 framework is examined.38 We found
that a bare charged framework represents a realistic model for
our calculations of the local geometry of AlO4 tetrahedra in
fully hydrated, cation-containing silicon-rich zeolites.38 The
predictions of the 27Al isotropic chemical shifts corresponding
to Al in the individual T-sites are based on calculations of the
local structure around the Al-site using a quantum mechanics–
molecular mechanics hybrid approach (QM-Pot).38–40 The
subsequent evaluation of the NMR shielding values uses the
GIAO method.30 Both steps are based on the density functional
theory (DFT). The calculated Al shieldings were converted to
Al isotropic chemical shifts employing the experimental and
theoretical NMR parameters obtained for the silicon-rich
structure of chabasite.38
The predicted isotropic chemical shifts are compared with
the results of 27Al 3Q MAS NMR measurements for a set of
ZSM-5 samples synthesized under diﬀerent conditions. Good
agreement between calculated and measured 27Al isotropic
chemical shifts is found and a partial assignment of observed
resonances to speciﬁc crystallographic sites in ZSM-5 is made.
Moreover, our combined computational and experimental
study shows that the Al siting in ZSM-5 is not random
and can be substantially varied by the conditions of zeolite
syntheses.
2.
Experimental methods and samples
A set of samples (A-R) of the ZSM-5 zeolite with Si/Al ratios
in the range from 14 to 140, with no Al–O–Si–O–Al sequences
and a low concentration of Al–O–(Si–O)2–Al sequences
(see section 3.1) was prepared under hydrothermal conditions
and autogenous pressure at a temperature of 170 1C with
agitation for a period of 7–10 d. The aluminium, silicon and
sodium sources and the structure directing agents (SDA) used
for synthesis are given in Table S1 of the ESI.w Na-ZSM-5/B
and Na-ZSM-5/N were purchased from Conteca B.V. Sweden,
Na-ZSM-5/H was provided by the Institute of Oil and Hydro-
carbon Gases, Slovnaft and ZSM-5/K by the Research In-
stitute of Inorganic Chemistry Inc., Unipetrol. Na-ZSM-5/M
was purchased from Su
¨ d-Chemie AG Mu
¨ nchen, Germany.
Calcined samples were equilibrated with 0.5 M NaCl to obtain
Na-ZSM-5. Ion exchange of zeolites with 0.5 M LiCl was
employed to prepare Li-ZSM-5/A and Li-ZSM-5/E from
Na-ZSM-5.
Na-ZSM-5/E
and
Na-ZSM-5/H
were
ion
exchanged with 1.0 M NH4NO3 and subsequent calcination
in an oxygen stream resulted in H-ZSM-5/E and H-ZSM-5/H.
An equilibration of the Na-zeolites with 0.05 M Co(NO3)2 at
ambient temperature led to the maximum [Co2+(H2O)6]2+
loaded zeolites. The synthesis of silicon rich chabazite (Si/Al
38) is described in detail in ref. 41. XRD, KBr-FTIR and SEM
indicated good crystallinity of calcined ion exchanged samples.
Moreover, FTIR characterization of acid sites via adsorption
of d3-acetonitrile as well as
29Si MAS NMR indicated a
negligible amount of extraframework Al atoms. The chemical
composition of the Na-, Li- and H-ZSM-5 zeolites was

determined by using atomic absorption spectrometry and is
given together with the maximum [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ exchange
capacity of zeolites in Table 1. 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR and
27Al 3Q MAS NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker
Avance 500 MHz (11.7 T) Wide Bore spectrometer using
4 mm o.d. ZrO2 rotors with a rotation speed of 5 kHz in the
case of 29Si MAS NMR and 12 kHz for 27Al MAS NMR. All
the Na- and Li-samples were dried only at ambient tempera-
ture to guarantee their full hydration. H-ZSM-5 zeolites were
after deamonization at 450 1C washed on a ﬁlter and then
dried at ambient temperature. A 29Si MAS NMR high-power
decoupling experiment with the p/6 (1.7 ms) excitation pulse
and the relaxation delay of 30 s was applied to collect a single
pulse spectrum. The chemical shifts were referenced to Q8M8.
The framework aluminium content (Si/AlFR) was estimated
from the 29Si NMR data.
To allow a quantitative evolution of the 27Al MAS NMR
spectra, high-power decoupling pulse sequences with p/12
(0.7 ms) excitation pulse were applied. The isotropic chemical
shifts were referenced to the aqueous solution of Al(NO3)3.
Two-dimensional multi-quantum experiments (2D 3Q) were
used to determine the 27Al isotropic chemical shift-diso
27Al.
The 3Q experiments were performed using the two-pulse
z-ﬁltered procedure. A p pulse was used for the excitation
and a p/3 pulse for the conversion. The pulses were individu-
ally optimised for each sample. The 2D contour plots
presented in the paper are results of a 2D Fourier transforma-
tion followed by a shearing transformation. The isotropic
chemical shift was estimated using
diso = (17dF1 + 10dF2)/27
where dF1 is the chemical shift in the isotropic and dF2 in the
observed dimension. The 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectroscopy of
silicon-rich zeolites is discussed by van Bokhoven24 and the 3Q
MAS NMR technique is explained in detail by Alemany.21
The 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, the F1 and F2 projec-
tions and the F1 slices of the 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectra were
simulated using the Origin software (Microcall Inc., USA).

Experimental results
3.1
Al local density and characterization of investigated
materials
A typical 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of hydrated Na-zeolite
(ZSM-5/F) and its simulation is shown in Fig. 1. It is similar to
those reported previously for ZSM-5 zeolites.42,43 Thus, the
resonances above 110 ppm were assigned to Si(4Si) sites. The
bands between 103 and 108 ppm correspond to Si(3Si,1Al)
sites, i.e. Si atoms with one neighboring Al atom. The reso-
nances with chemical shifts below 100 ppm representing
Si(2Si,2Al) sites with two Al neighbors were not observed.
The spectra of other investigated samples were similar, also
without any bands corresponding to Si(2Si,2Al) atoms. This is
evidence that Al–O–Si–O–Al sequences are absent in the
investigated samples.
The silicon to framework aluminium ratio (see Table 1) of
the samples (Si/AlFR) was estimated using44
Si/AlFR = I/0.25 I1
where I denotes the total intensity of the 29Si NMR signal in
the single pulse experiment and I1 denotes the intensity of the
NMR line corresponding to the Si(3Si,1Al) atoms. This value
of Si/AlFR corresponds well to the Si/Al values obtained from
the chemical analysis revealing that extra framework Al atoms
are not present in the investigated samples.
Table 1 shows the maximum ion exchange capacity of
zeolites for divalent [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ complexes. The exclusive
presence of the [Co2+(H2O)6]2+ complexes in our samples was
checked by visible spectroscopy (not shown in the ﬁgures).

The low ion exchange capacity of the ZSM-5 zeolites for
divalent complexes indicates that the concentration of close
Al atoms in the framework is low (6–30% of Al atoms). The
details of the determination of the Al local density by Co2+
ions as a probe are discussed elsewhere.45,46
3.2
27Al NMR spectra and Al distribution
All the investigated samples exhibit exclusively the signal
centered around 55 ppm in the SP (single pulse) 27Al MAS
NMR spectrum (not shown in the ﬁgures). This signal corres-
ponds to the Al atoms with a tetrahedral coordination.25 The
resonance around 0 ppm corresponding to octahedrally
coordinated Al atoms was not observed in the spectrum con-
ﬁrming the conclusion of the exclusive presence of Al atoms in
the zeolite framework based on the 29Si MAS NMR experiment
(see above). The 3Q 27Al MAS NMR method was employed to
resolve the individual resonances corresponding to diﬀerent
tetrahedrally coordinated Al atoms. A typical 2D plot of the
results for Na-ZSM-5 is shown in Fig. 2 and S1 of the ESIw
together with the F1 (along the y axis) and F2 projections as
well as with selected F1 and F2 slices. The F1 and F2 projec-
tions of all the samples and their simulations are depicted in
Fig. 3 and 2 and Fig. S1 of the ESI.w The NMR parameters
(Tables 2 and 3)—the dF1 and dF2 values and the Al isotropic
chemical shifts (diso) were obtained from a simulation of the F1
and F2 projections and F1 and F2 slices. Note that the same Al
isotropic chemical shift can correspond to diﬀerent resonances
diﬀering in their dF1 and dF2 NMR parameters (e.g. R-VII and
R-VIII). Thus, analysis of these NMR parameters is necessary
to identify individual resonances in the spectrum. Comparison of
the spectra of the hydrated Na-, Li-ZSM-5/A; Na-, H-ZSM-5/H;
and Na-, Li-, H-ZSM-5/E (Table 2) indicates that there is no
observable eﬀect of the type of counter cation balancing the
framework negative charge on the 27Al NMR parameters of
the hydrated ZSM-5 zeolite.
3.3
Al distribution in ZSM-5
At least 12 resonances, designated as I–XII, can be identiﬁed
in the
27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectra of the investigated
Na-ZSM-5 zeolites (Table 3). Almost all resonances exhibit
a low dispersion of the isotropic chemical shifts (%0.2 ppm)
and of the dF1 and dF2 values for the diﬀerent ZSM-5 samples.
This fact indicates that the accuracy of the estimation of the
27Al NMR parameters is better than 0.2 ppm for the
majority of samples. Thus, each of the resonances I–V and
VII–XII could be assigned to Al in one particular framework
T-site. The scattered NMR parameters of the signal of R-VI

can rather correspond to several unresolved resonances with
very close shieldings but located at diﬀerent T-sites. Note that
each of the resonances I–XII was found for at least two
samples. Moreover, the resonances III, IV, VI, IX, XI, and
XII were also observed for the zeolites exchanged with diﬀer-
ent counter cations (Li+, H+). Thus, the attribution of the
resolved resonances to an experimental artifact can be ruled
out. At least two resonances of each sample were also observed
for at least one more sample indicating that the change of the
NMR parameters is not due to a variation of macroscopic
parameters. We conclude that at least 12 framework T-sites
are occupied by Al atoms in the set of the investigated ZSM-5
samples.

Quantiﬁcation of Al distribution in ZSM-5
The details of the single pulse 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the
Na-zeolite samples in the tetrahedral region and their simula-
tions are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 of the ESI.w These spectra
were used to quantify the concentration of the Al atoms in the
individual T-sites. The estimated distribution of Al atoms is
shown in Fig. 4. Both the siting as well as the relative
concentration of Al in the individual T-sites vary signiﬁcantly.

Zeolite models used for calculations
High-resolution
27Al MAS NMR spectra of zeolites can
be successfully measured only for fully hydrated matrices
due to the strong quadrupolar interaction of the aluminium
atoms in dehydrated zeolite.47 Thus, the NMR parameters

characterizing the Al atoms and their environments in the
ZSM-5 framework can be measured only for samples contain-
ing counter cations or H3O+ and water molecules. Due
to the large number of possible conﬁgurations, isotropic
chemical shift calculations including the hydration of zeolite
and the solvated counter cation would require extensive
sampling over isotropic chemical shifts calculated quantum
mechanically
for
the
individual
conﬁgurations
and
structures.
To avoid this massive computational problem we look for a
simple model of the complex structure of a hydrated zeolite.
We adopt a bare charged framework with a single Al atom in a
unit cell to describe the local geometry around the Al nucleus.
This is a realistic model because of the reasons as follows: in
completely hydrated zeolites, the fully solvated counter cation
is located close to the center of the cavity/channel and does not
directly interact with the AlO4 tetrahedra as evidenced by a
number of XRD studies of hydrated zeolites.48 This fact is
further supported, for example, by the optical spectroscopic
studies of Co2+ or Cu2+ ions in hydrated zeolites.49,50 More-
over, the cation in hydrated zeolites is rotationally free, as
indicated by the sharp and narrow resonances in the 7Li and
133Cs MAS NMR spectra of hydrated Li-ZSM-5/E51 and
Cs-MOR,52 respectively. Therefore, the eﬀect of the hydrated
counter cation on the local geometry of the AlO4 tetrahedra in
hydrated silicon rich zeolites and thus on the 27Al isotropic
chemical shift is negligible as shown in Table 2. This observa-
tion is in agreement with the result of Sarv et al. who reported
a tiny diﬀerence 0–0.2 ppm in the F1 values of the resonances
observed with Na- and Ca-ZSM-5.22 Similar observations
have been made on calculated 29Si-NMR shifts for mono-
silicate species.53 The calculated shifts for hydrated H+ and
K+ counterions agree within 0.1 ppm.
The explanation of all these ﬁndings is that the shielding
depends primarily on the local structure around the magnetic
nucleus and that solvent and counterions do not aﬀect the
shielding by ‘‘through space’’ eﬀects. Hence 27Al isotropic
chemical shift calculations can be made on models that
do not include water molecules and counter ions explicitly.
This assumption, by the way, is also implicit in the angle
correlation
model25
that
has
been
applied
in
previous
studies.23 Our model goes beyond it in as far as it includes
up to ﬁve bonds away from the magnetic nucleus instead of
two and it calculates the shieldings explicitly instead of relying
on a correlation.
We conclude that a bare charged framework with a single
Al atom in a unit cell represents a realistic model to describe
the Al local geometry and predict the 27Al isotropic chemical
shift for individual T-sites in ZSM-5. The ﬁnal proof that this
model is adequate can only come from a favorable agreement
of calculated isotropic chemical shifts with observed ones. This
is indeed the case as discussed in section 7.3. and exempliﬁed
by the close agreement between calculated (14.1) and mea-
sured (13.6 ppm) ranges of
27Al isotropic chemical shifts
(Table 4) and by the similar shift patterns (Fig. 5).
5.
Computational methods
5.1
Models and optimization of structures
The computations are performed for a single Al atom in a unit
cell of ZSM-5. A bare zeolite framework model is adopted that
includes neither cations nor water molecules and possesses
P1 symmetry. Each Al atom bears a formal charge of 1. The
starting structure was generated from the X-ray structure of
mutinaite,54,55 which is the natural analogue of ZSM-5. First,
both the lattice constants and the atomic positions of the all-
silica MFI structure were optimized at constant pressure by
the GULP program56,57 using interatomic potential functions
only. Then the silicon atom in the site of interest was replaced
by an aluminium atom and the structure and the lattice
constants were further optimized at constant pressure. The
optimized structure was subsequently used for deﬁning a
cluster around the Al atom for our QM-Pot calculations.39,40
The clusters were embedded into a super cell composed of two
unit cells of the zeolite framework and the structure of the
entire system was optimized by QMPOT at constant volume.
5.2
Cluster models
For all calculations, clusters having the Al atom in the center
and including ﬁve coordination shells (Al–O–Si–O–Si–O–Hlink)
were used.31 They were cut out from the corresponding
optimized super cells. Due to the presence of silicate rings in
the framework of ZSM-5, the created ﬁve-shell clusters
contained pairs of very close Hlink atoms. Since the close Hlink
atoms represented the same Si atom, they were replaced by the
corresponding Si(OHlink)2 moiety. This was repeated until the
cluster contained no such pairs.

5.3
QM-Pot method
The QM-Pot method employed39,40 partitions the whole
system (S) into two parts. The inner part (I) is treated by
quantum mechanics (QM) and the outer part (O) as well as all
the interactions between the inner and outer layers are treated
by parametrized interatomic potential functions (Pot). The
dangling bonds of the inner part are saturated by link hydro-
gen atoms. The atoms of the inner part together with the link
atoms form the cluster (C). The QM-Pot energy of the whole
system is given by
EQM–Pot(S) = EQM(C) + EPot(S) – EPot(C)
where EQM(C) is the energy of the cluster at the QM level,
EPot(S) is the energy of the entire system at the Pot level and
EPot(C) is the energy of the cluster at Pot. The QM-Pot
approach is discussed in detail elsewhere.58
The calculations were performed by the QMPOT program40
which utilizes the Turbomole program59–63 for the QM part
and the GULP program56,57 for the periodic potential function
calculations. The pure DFT method employing the BLYP64–66
functional and the TZVP basis set of Ahlrichs67 were used for
the QM calculations. Shell-model ion-pair potentials68 para-
metrized on DFT results for zeolites69 were employed as
interatomic potential functions (Pot). The electrostatic energy
was evaluated by standard Ewald summation techniques for
all cores and shells. A cut-oﬀradius of 10 A
˚ was chosen for the
summation of short-range interactions.
5.4
Calculation of 27Al isotropic chemical shifts
Subsequently to the QM-Pot structure determination, the
Gaussian program70 was employed to calculate NMR shield-
ing tensors of the atoms of the optimized clusters at the BLYP/
TZVP level using the gauge-independent atomic orbital
method (GIAO).30
5.5
Conversion of chemical shieldings into 27Al isotropic
chemical shifts
A chabazite sample having a Si/Al ratio of 38 was employed to
convert the calculated chemical shieldings into isotropic che-
mical shifts. A 2D plot of the 27Al 3Q MAS NMR spectrum,
F1 and F2 projections and their simulation of the sample
are described in Fig. 6. Two resonances are present in the
spectrum. The strong one exhibits an isotropic chemical shift
at 60.0 ppm (F1 = 60.4 and F2 = 59.3), weak (ca. 25% of the
intensity) resonance exhibits an isotropic chemical shift at
59.2 ppm (F1 = 60.0 and F2 = 57.9). The same approach
and the same cluster size as described above were used to
calculate the 27Al chemical shielding of chabazite utilizing a
model of four chabazite unit cells with one Al/Si substitution
(Si/Al 47). The Al/Si substitution breaks down the symmetry
of the chabazite framework and one distinguishable T-site of
all-silica chabazite splits into three distinguishable T-sites. The
QM-Pot relative energies, average T–O–T angles and 27Al
chemical shieldings of Al in the 3 T-sites of chabazite (Si/Al 47)
are listed in Table 5. The diﬀerences between the distinguish-
able T-sites are signiﬁcantly smaller than those for the ZSM-5
zeolite. The splitting of one T-site into 3 T-sites is reﬂected in
three values of the calculated 27Al chemical shielding, how-
ever, two of them have very similar values. This result is in
very good agreement with the two observed
27Al NMR
resonances (Fig. 6) for the silicon rich chabazite. The 27Al
NMR shieldings of 490.0/489.9 and 490.4 ppm relate to the
experimental values of 60.0 and 59.2 ppm, respectively, for the
27Al isotropic chemical shift. The relation of the shielding of
490.0 corresponding to the 27Al isotropic chemical shift of
60.0 ppm is used for the conversion of the calculated 27Al
NMR shieldings to 27Al isotropic chemical shifts.
6.
Local AlO4 structures and 27Al NMR shieldings
Our QM-Pot calculations of ZSM-5 structures (P1 symmetry)
containing one Al atom per unit cell resulted in 24 distinguish-
able structures corresponding to Al substitution into the 24
T-sites of monoclinic ZSM-5. The force ﬁeld relative energies
of Al in the 24 T-sites of ZSM-5 are all within 10 kcal mol1
(Table S2 of the ESIw). This is similar to previous studies.11,15
The sites T13 and T5 are most stable, T18 is the least
stable site.
Table 6 shows the calculated average T–O–T angles, the
GIAO 27Al NMR shieldings and the corresponding isotropic
chemical shifts (calibrated employing the chabazite zeolite, see
section 5.5) for the 24 T-sites; for the four individual T–O–T
angles of each site see Table S3 of the ESI.w The calculated
Al–O–Si angles scatter between 124 and 1721, but the average
Al–O–Si angles vary signiﬁcantly less—from 1401 (T24 site) to
1541 (T20 site). The site with the smallest average angle (T24)
corresponds to the smallest GIAO-calculated 27Al NMR shield-
ing, 485.2 ppm, and the one with the largest average angle
(T20 site) to the largest shielding, 499.3 ppm. Note that a higher
shielding corresponds to a lower isotropic chemical shift.

Based on comparison between the crystallographic and 27Al
NMR data of aluminium rich zeolites, Lippmaa et al.25
suggested a linear correlation between the 27Al NMR isotropic
chemical shift d(Al) and the average T–O–T angle (y) of the
zeolite framework.
d(Al) = –0.50y + 132 ppm
The calculated GIAO 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts are
plotted against the average Al–O–Si angles in Fig. 7. The plot
shows that the linear correlation does not hold even when the
calculated Al–O–Si angles are used instead of crystallographic
T–O–T angles. Let us select two pairs of sites from Table 6
(see also Fig. 7) to illustrate this point. The average Al–O–Si
angles for T1 and T7 are virtually identical (143.5 and 143.31,
respectively). Thus the isotropic chemical shifts d(Al) calcu-
lated using linear correlation were essentially the same,
whereas the GIAO 27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts vary
signiﬁcantly (63.7 and 60.0 ppm, respectively). On the con-
trary, the T10 and T15 sites diﬀer considerably in their average
T–O–T angles (146.1 and 153.51, respectively) but their GIAO
27Al NMR isotropic chemical shifts diﬀer by 0.1 ppm only
(57.7 and 57.6 ppm, respectively). These examples show that
there is no simple linear correlation between the 27Al NMR
isotropic chemical shift and the corresponding average T–O–T
angle of the AlO4 tetrahedron.
Our conclusion regarding the failure of the linear correla-
tion is in agreement with that reached by Kuc
ˇ era and
Nachtigal37 for the MCM-58 zeolite from periodic DFT
results. They explained the failure by diﬀerent eﬀects of the
Na+ counter cation and its hydration degree on the geometry
of the four distinguishable T-sites. On the contrary, our results
clearly indicate that the relationship between the 27Al NMR
isotropic chemical shift and the local geometry of AlO4 is more
complex and does not depend only on the average Al–O–Si
angles.
7.
Discussion
7.1
Al siting in ZSM-5
As detailed in the Results section, the observed resonances for
all ZSM-5 samples correspond to Al located in at least 12
diﬀerent tetrahedral sites of the zeolite framework. Two new
resonances were identiﬁed compared to our preliminary results
reported in ref. 38 This can be explained by a signiﬁcantly
larger set of ZSM-5 samples used. The local coordination of Al
and its isotropic chemical shift could be aﬀected by the atom
type (Si or Al) of the second neighboring T-sites of the Al
atom. Thus, the assignment of several observed Al resonances
to one framework T-site cannot be excluded a priori. The Si/Al
ratios of the ZSM-5 samples considered are in the 14–140
interval. Our 29Si NMR measurements show that there are no
Al–O–Si–O–Al pairs, which allows us to rule out the eﬀect of
an Al atom as a next-nearest neighbor. There is also a low
population of close Al atoms (Al–O–(Si–O)2–Al sequences) in
the samples as our cobalt(II) exchange experiments indicate.
Moreover, no correlation between the presence of the close Al
atoms and the observed 27Al resonances was found. Thus the
12 observed resonances correspond to Al atoms in 12 distin-
guishable framework T-sites indicating that at least half of the
24 distinguishable T-sites predicted by our QM-Pot calcula-
tions are occupied in the set of the investigated ZSM-5
samples.
A previous study,23 in which only two resonances have been
resolved, came to a diﬀerent conclusion. The authors em-
ployed the empirical isotropic chemical shift—average T–O–T
angle correlation25 to predict 27Al NMR isotropic chemical
shifts from the (orthorhombic) XRD structure of a ZSM-5
sample with an Si/Al ratio of 86. The calculated isotropic
chemical shifts for the 12 T-sites varied over a range of
5.1 ppm only. Furthermore, all the F1 and F2 parameters

calculated for the 12 T-sites fell into the observed 3Q
spectrum.23 The present calculations show that this is an
artifact due to the use of the bond angles from the X-ray
structure. These are essentially Si–O–Si bond angles with only
small contributions of Si–O–Al bond angles because of the low
Al content.
The 12 resonances identiﬁed in the spectra of Na-ZSM-5
samples represent a signiﬁcant progress compared to previous
studies.22,23 Sarv et al.22 could report only three Al resonances,
which is due to the fact that they examined just one ZSM-5
sample. Also in the present study there are only between three
and ﬁve T-sites occupied by Al in a given ZSM-5 sample, but
there are 18 diﬀerent samples. Han et al.23 report only two
resonances. They investigated a set of samples, all prepared by
one procedure and diﬀering only in the framework Al con-
centration. In addition, the structure-directing agent was not
removed from their samples.
Note that the isotropic chemical shifts reported by Sarv22
(54.5, 57.1 and 59.4 ppm) are close to the resonances IV, VI
and IX which we ﬁnd at 54.6, 56.4 and 58.9 ppm, but a safe
assignment cannot be made, for the sample investigated
by Sarv et al.22 was not examined for the presence of
Al–O–(Si–O)2–Al sequences which can aﬀect the Al isotropic
chemical shift.
7.2
Al distribution over T-sites of the ZSM-5 framework
The results shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4 clearly indicate a large
variability in both sites occupied by Al atoms and the con-
centration of the Al atoms in these sites for the ZSM-5 samples
studied. Even samples with similar framework aluminium
concentration exhibit very diﬀerent Al sitings as well as Al
concentrations in the individual occupied T-sites. This fact
clearly rules out that the Al siting in the zeolite framework is
random or is controlled by thermodynamic stability. It rather
shows that the conditions of the synthesis are responsible for
the Al siting in the framework. A similar conclusion was
reached based on the presence of Al–O–(Si–O)1,2–Al sequen-
cies and isolated Al atoms (Al–O–(Si–O)n>2–Al) in ZSM-5
zeolites.45,46,71 Corma et al. discussed the role of the structure
directing agents72,73 or ﬂuorine anions74 on the Al siting in
zeolites.
The observed non-random Al siting in ZSM-5 is in good
agreement with the results of the high-resolution 27Al NMR
experiments not only for ZSM-5,22,23 but also for the zeolite
Beta.75 This shows that the dependence of the Al siting on the
synthesis conditions may be a general feature of silicon-rich
zeolites.
Our results summarized in Fig. 4 point to a complex
relationship between the conditions of the zeolite syntheses
and the Al siting, but one observation regarding the Al
distribution is made. The site corresponding to R-VI is
signiﬁcantly more often occupied in the investigated samples
than the other ones. However, the high occupation is likely
caused by the fact that this resonance represents several T-sites
having close NMR parameters as Fig. 5 shows.
Fig. 8 shows the eﬀect of Si/Al on the number of T-sites
occupied by Al atoms. Clearly, there is no eﬀect of the
framework Al content on the number of occupied T-sites.
From three to ﬁve T-sites are occupied by Al in the whole
concentration range (Si/Al 14–140). This conclusion is coun-
terintuitive and indicates that the conditions and mechanisms
of the zeolite synthesis are crucial for the Al distribution in the
zeolite framework.
7.3
Assignment of observed resonances to T-sites
Fig. 5 compares the calculated and measured 27Al isotropic
chemical shifts. The values for the diﬀerent T-sites extend over
the ranges of 14.1 and 13.6 ppm, respectively. In addition, the
patterns of the predicted and observed isotropic chemical
shifts show similarities. Based on similar spacings and least
deviations between calculated and observed isotropic chemical
shifts a partial assignment of observed resonances to crystallo-
graphic sites in ZSM-5 is possible (Table 4): Resonance I
(hereafter R-I) corresponds to T20 and R-IV to T6. The pair
R-II, R-III can be assigned to the T4, T8 pair. At the low-
shielding end, two assignments are plausible. The smallest
deviations between the calculated and observed isotropic
chemical shifts are reached if it is assumed that T24
(64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that R-XII
belongs to T1, R-XI to T17 and R-X to T7. The isotropic
chemical shift deviations are all between +0.7 and 0.3 ppm
and the calculated range is 13.0 ppm, 0.6 ppm smaller than the
I to XII range of observed resonances (13.6 ppm). It follows
then that T-sites T12 (60.8), T3 (61.7), and T18 (62.0) are most
likely not occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. To which of
the remaining 13 T-sites Resonances V to IX belong remains
open, see Fig. 5. If we assume that the calculated isotropic
chemical shifts are systematically larger than the observed
ones by 0.7–1.3 ppm (see Fig. 5 and Table 3) due to a shift
of the secondary standard we can assign R-XII and R-XI with
the largest isotropic chemical shifts to the least shielded T24
and T1 sites, respectively, and R-X to T12. Then the sites T3
(61.7), T18 (62.0), and T17 (62.5) would be unoccupied by Al
in our ZSM-5 samples. This second assignment leads to
deviations between +1.3 and –0.3 ppm and the calculated
isotropic chemical shift range (14.1 ppm) would be 0.5 ppm
larger than the observed one.
These results represent a signiﬁcant progress in interpreting
27Al MAS NMR spectra of zeolites and the ﬁrst partially
successful analysis of the Al siting in a framework of a

silicon-rich zeolite. These achievements clearly demonstrate
the power of the high resolution NMR experiment combined
with DFT (QM-Pot) calculations and also support the
pure framework model adopted in the calculations. The chosen
experimental approach of controlling the Al siting in silicon-
rich zeolites by varying the synthesis conditions can be
employed to investigate the eﬀect of the Al siting on the
physicochemical properties of zeolite catalysts. This might lead
to a better design of acidic and redox catalysts with a controlled
Al siting and thus tuned properties of the active sites.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have demonstrated that a combined experi-
mental (27Al 3Q MAS NMR) and theoretical (QM-Pot
employing the bare framework model) approach represents a
powerful tool for the determination of the local geometry of
framework AlO4 tetrahedra, the prediction of 27Al isotropic
chemical shifts in hydrated zeolites, and the identiﬁcation of
Al siting in the framework of silicon-rich zeolites.
Experimental evidence is provided for the occupation of at
least 12 out of 24 distinguishable framework T-sites by Al
atoms in silicon-rich ZSM-5. The observed
27Al isotropic
chemical shifts of 50.0 and 54.7 correspond to Al atoms in
the T20 and T6 sites, respectively. The pair of resonances at
52.9 and 53.7 ppm corresponds to the pair of the T8 and T4
sites. At the low-shielding end, two assignments are plausible.
The smallest deviations between the calculated and observed
isotropic chemical shifts are reached if it is assumed that T24
(64.8 ppm) is not occupied in the samples and that R-XII
belongs to T1, R-XI to T17 and R-X to T7. It follows then that
T-sites T12 (60.8), T3 (61.7), and T18 (62.0) are most likely not
occupied by Al in our ZSM-5 samples. If we assume that the
calculated isotropic chemical shifts are systematically larger
than the observed ones then we can assign R-XII and R-XI
with the largest isotropic chemical shifts to the least shielded
T24 and T1 sites, respectively, and R-X to T12. Then the sites
T3 (61.7), T18 (62.0), and T17 (62.5) would be unoccupied by
Al in our ZSM-5 samples. The assignment of the remaining
three resonances remains ambiguous. The conclusion is
reached that the Al distribution over framework T-sites is
neither random nor controlled by a simple rule, but depends
on the conditions of zeolite synthesis.
Furthermore, although there is a trend for smaller 27Al
isotropic chemical shifts with increasing average Al–O–Si
bond angles, we have shown that the correlation is not good
enough for assignment purposes. Therefore, the local geo-
metry of framework AlO4 tetrahedra cannot be inferred from
experimental isotropic chemical shifts but can only be
obtained from theoretical calculations.
