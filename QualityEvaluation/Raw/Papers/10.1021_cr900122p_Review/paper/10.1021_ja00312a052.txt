Abstract: The organolanthanides (Cp’,MH),, Cp’ = v ~ - ( C H ~ ) ~ C ~ ,  
M = La, Nd, Sm, and Lu, and (Me2SiCp”2MH)2, 
Cp” 
= T ~ - ( C H ~ ) ~ C ~ ,  
M = Nd, Sm, and Lu are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrogenation. In 
the case of 1-hexene - 
n-hexane, 
activities decrease in the order Cp’,Lu > Cp’,Sm > Cp’,Nd > Me2SiCp”,Lu > Cp’,La > Me,SiCp”,Sm > Me,SiCp”,Nd, 
with N, for the most active catalyst exceeding 120000 h-’ at 25 O
C
 and 1 atm of H2. Under the conditions employed, the 
rate law is Y 0: [~lefin]~[Lanthanide] 
[H2] 
suggesting rapid, exothermic Lanthanide-Hlolefin addition and rate-limiting M-C 
hydrogenolysis. When D2 uptake is not mass-transport-limited, the predominant product is hexane-l,2-d2. For all catalysts 
except (Cp’,LuH),, cyclohexene hydrogenation (to yield predominantly cyclohexane-1,2-d2 
under D2 
in a non-mass-transport-limited 
regime) obeys the rate law u 0: [olefin] 
[Lantha~~ide]’/~[H,]~, 
suggesting rate-limiting Lanthanide-H/olefin addition. For 
Cp’,Lu, the rate law is u 0: [olefin] 
[lanthanide] 
[H,]’, suggesting rate-limiting (Lu-H),/olefin addition or that the hydride 
dimer is largely dissociated under these conditions. The relative activities are less than for 1-hexene and follow the order 
(Me2SiCp”zNdH)2 
> (Me2SiCp”,SmH), > (Cp’,LaH), I 
(Cp’,NdH), > ( M ~ , S ~ C ~ ” , L U H ) ~  
I 
(Cp’,SmH),. Addition of 
THF significantly decreases the rate both of 1-hexene hydrogenation and (more so) cyclohexene hydrogenation. For all catalysts 
examined, 3-hexyne hydrogenation follows a two-stage rate law u 0: [alkyneIo[Lanthanide] 
[H2] 
(3-hexyne - 
cis-3-hexene) 
and Y 0: [olefin] [Lanthanide]’/z[H2]0 
(cis-3-hexane - 
n-hexane) except for (Cp’,LuH), where Y 0: [olefin] [Lanthanide] 
[H2Io. 
The rate laws and relative activity trends for trans-2-hexene and trans-3-hexene hydrogenation parallel those for 1-hexene, 
while cis-2-hexene behaves like cis-3-hexene. While the present olefin and acetylene hydrogenation catalysis can be understood 
largely on the basis of established or reasonably extrapolated organo-f-element 
reactivity and bond enthalpy patterns, the steps 
in the catalytic cycles must proceed with remarkably low activation energies and must be coupled with high efficiency. 
In the two preceding papers in this i s ~ u e , ~ . ~  
we describe general 
syntheses, chemical, and structural properties of broad classes of 
lanthanide CP’,MCH(TMS)~, 
(Cp12MH),, Me,SiCp”,MCH- 
(TMS),, and (Me,SiCp”,MH), complexes (Cp’ = $-(CH3)5CS, 
Cp” = (CH3),CS, TMS = Si(CH3),). The hydrides, prepared 
by hydrogenolysis of the alkyls, were found to be highly reactive. 
For example, the lighter members of the series were found to be 
some of the most active “homogeneous” ethylene polymerization 
catalysts known. Survey experiments also indicated surprisingly 
high activity for olefin hydrogenation, which is the topic of the 
present contribution. 
Mechanistically, homogeneous olefin hydrogenation catalysts4 
with early transition-metal,s lanthanide,6 and actinide’ catalysts 
is not well understood and offers a much different mechanistic 
situation than conventional group 8 or late transition-element 
 catalyst^.^^^ In 
particular, the metal center may be in a relatively 
high (33) formal oxidation state, may not possess energetically 
accessible formal oxidation states for oxidative addition/reductive 
elimination processes, may be engaged in relatively polar met- 
al-ligand bonding with a strong preference for “hard” ligands (not 
olefins), and may exhibit unusual M-H/M-C 
bond disruption 
enthalpy relationships vis-&vis middle and late transition elements. 
Lanthanide ions represent the extreme cases of many of the above 
considerations and as such offer an opportunity to better un- 
derstand hydrogenation catalysis in such environments. We 
present here a full account of our kinetic and mechanistic studies 
using bis(pentamethylcyclopentadieny1) and related organo- 
lanthanides as homogeneous olefin hydrogenation  catalyst^.^ The 
investigation has been carried out as a function of lanthanide (La, 
Nd, Sm, and Lu), lanthanide supporting ligation (Cp’,M vs. 
Me,SiCp”,M), solvent, and olefin. It will be seen that the com- 
In this paper the periodic group notation is in accord with recent actions 
by IUPAC and ACS nomenclature committees. A and B notation is elimi- 
nated because of wide confusion. Groups IA and IIA become groups 1 and 
2. The d-transition elements comprise groups 3 through 12, and the p-block 
elements comprise groups 13 through 18. (Note that the former Roman 
number designation is preserved in the last digit of the new numbering: e.g., 
I11 - 
3 and 13.) 
0002-7863/85/1507-8111$01.50/0 
ponent transformations of the catalytic cycles can be largely 
understood on the basis of established f-element reactivity and 
thermodynamic relationships. What is surprising, however, is how 
efficiently the sequences of transformations can be coupled when 
in the proper coordination environment.

Catalytic Experiments. Kinetic studies were carried out in an all glass, 
metal, and Teflon grease-free constant-volume, pseudo-constant-pressure 
gas-uptake apparatus. The glass reaction vessel (ca. 20 mL in volume, 
Figure 1) was fitted with Morton-type indentations and a high-speed 
vortex agitator (American Scientific MT-5 
1 vortex mixer) to ensure 
efficient mixing, a water jacket connected to a recirculating pump and 
a Haake constant-temperature bath (25.0 & 0.1 "C) for thermal regu- 
lation, calibrated burets for admitting reagents, and a large diameter 
flexible stainless steel connection to a high-vacuum line with an efficient 
diffusion pump. The gas handling system was of the Hussey-Burwell 
type"as with gas ballasts (all thermostated at 25.0 * 
0.1 "C except for 
a large, 21.0-L steel gas cylinder ballast employed for very rapid reac- 
tionsI2) and a Datametrics 1023 Barocel Differential Electronic Ma- 
nometer to measure small pressure changes. In addition to the standard 
gas purification columns, H2 
(or D2) was passed through an additional 
MnO/Si0210as column immediately prior to entering the gas handling 
manifold. Data (pressure in the system vs. an adjustable reference 
pressure as a function of time) were outputed to a Linear Systems strip 
chart recorder. Data analysis and plotting were carried out with a 
Hewlett-Packard HP-1000 F series minicomputer and interfaced graphics 
system. 
In a typical experiment, the oven-dried reaction vessel was attached 
to the vacuum line while still hot, pumped down for at least 1 h, closed 
under vacuum, and taken into a Vacuum Atmospheres glovebox with a 
high-capacity recirculating system. The burets were then filled with 
catalyst solution (freshly prepared on the vacuum line using calibrated 
volumetric vessels) and olefin. The reaction vessel was then filled with 
a measured quantity of freshly distilled solvent (cyclohexane, toluene, or 
THF), closed, and transferred outside to the vacuum line. The reaction 
volume was evacuated and the solvent freeze-thaw-degassed, back-filling 
repeatedly with H2. Next, the thermostated water circulating system was 
connected and actuated. After all parts of the system had appropriate 
time to reach thermal equilibrium and equilibrium with the reactor at- 
mosphere, measured volumes of catalyst solution and olefin were added 
to the reaction vessel. High-speed vortex mixing was then initiated and 
the H2 
pressure recorded as a function of time. Appropriate corrections 
in data analysis were made for solvent and reactant/product vapor 
pressures. In general, conditions were adjusted such that all of the olefin 
was consumed in 0.13-10 min and the overall pressure drop in the system 
was always less than 2% (usually less than 1%). A number of control 
experiments were conducted to determine experimental boundary con- 
ditions beyond which the rate of H 2  
uptake became mass-transport-lim- 
ited;"d,e Le., the regime in which the measured rate of gas uptake was 
limited by the rate at which hydrogen could be delivered (diffuse) to all 
parts of the reaction solution rather than by the actual rate of the 
chemical reaction being studied. Under such conditions, the concentra- 
tion of H2 in the liquid phase is no longer that corresponding to equi- 
librium with gas-phase H2. This situation was evident when, for constant 
PH2, 
constant mixing rate, and constant concentrations of olefin and 
catalyst, plots of turnover frequency (N,) 
vs. increasing overall quantity 
of reaction solution began to deviate from linearity (Le., N, 
was no longer 
constant) or when, at very high rates of gas uptake, the measured reaction 
rate began to deviate (in a negative direction) from a well-behaved rate 
law for further increases in rate. Such effects were, of course, most 
evident at low mixing speeds, and conditions for optimum mixing (to 
ensure the maximum reaction solution surface area, the reaction solution 
should appear as a dense aerosol) as well as optimum reaction solution 
volume were carefully established. In all experiments employed for 
kinetic analyses, experimental N, 
values were at least 25% below the point 
where it was determined that mass-transport effects became significant. 
Reproducibility in N, values for the same reaction at the same H2 
pressure using different batches of olefin and catalyst solution was within 
5-10%.

vis-&vis various substrates, the disposition of deuterium labels, 
the effects of a coordinating solvent, and stoichiometric model 
reactions were carried out. Considerable attention was devoted 
to the scrupulous maintenance of anaerobic conditions and to the 
avoidance of mass-transport effects. In the ensuing discussion, 
it is implicitly assumed that the catalysts are homogeneous in 
nature. Indeed, it will be seen that all the mechanistic data and 
stoichiometric model reactions are readily interpreted in terms 
of 
the chemistry of 
soluble (Cp',MH),, 
Cp',MR, 
(Me,SiCp",MH),, 
and M ~ , S ~ C P " ~ M R

Hydrogenation of 1-Hexene. The hydrogenation of 1 
-hexene 
by the members of either organolanthanide series was found to 
be extremely rapid. In 
both series, the relative 
ordering of activities 
was found to be approximately inversely proportional to metal 
ionic radius: Lu > Sm > Nd > La. For constant M, the CP'~M 
derivatives are more active than the corresponding Me,SiCp", 
complexes. To view the present activities in perspective, it is 
instructive to compare Nt 
for (Cp',LuH),-catalyzed hydrogenation 
at 25 OC, 1 atm of H2

Under the conditions of the present studies, 1-hexene hydro- 
genation in cyclohexane or toluene solutions was found to be 
zero-order in olefin (over 399% of the reaction), first-order in 
catalyst, and first-order in hydrogen pressure. The ranges of 
concentrations/pressures employed are given in the representative 
kinetic plots of Figure 2. These observations and those with other

(eq 
3) is rate-limiting. For 1-hexene, 
the assertion that K2 
is large 
is borne out by both thermodynamic datal9 and numerous em- 
pirical observations relating to P-hydride elimination processes 
in organo-)element systems.20*21 
Moreover, ‘H NMR studies 
of eq 2 described in the first paper in this series2 
also indicate that 
k, (and probably K2) 
are very large, since at millimolar concen- 
trations, hydride is consumed by 1-hexene at a rate which is too 
rapid to measure by NMR at room temperature. 
The best information on eq 1 comes from variable-temperature 
NMR studies of C ~ ’ , L U ( ~ - H ) L U ( H ) C ~ ’ , . ~ ~  
Here, kl and k-, 
are reported to be rapid on the NMR time scale and AGO C 
2 
kcal/mol. Thus, at 25 OC, a 1 mM solution of this hydride will 
be greater than 10% dissociated. This conclusion is also in 
agreement with our cryoscopy results.2 It is reasonable to expect 
that the behavior of the other lanthanide hydrides will be similar, 
although species with M(p-H),M structures appear to be some- 
what less dissociated2 or reactive (vide infra). In regard to the 
irreversibility of eq 3, thermochemical  estimate^'^ place AH = 
-15 kcal/mol. Kinetic data for 1-hexene hydrogenation are 
compiled in Table I. The highest k3 
value is for the M = Lu 
system, 7700 M-I SKI. For comparison, the rate-determining 
hydrogenolysis step in the catalytic hydrogenation of methyl 
(Z)-a-acetamidocinnamate by Rh(diphos),+ proceeds with k = 
100 M-I s-I at 25 O C B b  
When the (Cp’,NdH),-catalyzed hydrogenation of 1-hexene 
is carried out under D2, 
the n-hexane obtained is 397% n-hex- 
ane-1 
,2-d2 
by GC/MS and I3C 
NMR.lW-fsh 
There are only traces 
of n-hexane-d3 
(-2%). 
Similar results are observed for M = La 
and Lu (the Lu-catalyzed reaction yields slightly more n-hex- 
ane-d3). If the Nd-catalyzed reaction mixture is sampled at 33% 
conversion, 2.9% of the unreacted olefin is present as 2-hexene 
(approximately equal amounts of cis and trans isomers); under 
D2, 
this 2-hexene is ca. 65% d, and 0% d,. There is no deuterium 
detectable (<1%) in the unreacted 1-hexene at 33% conversion, 
nor do control experiments evidence detectable exchange between 
n-hexane and D, under these conditions. O
n
 
the other hand, 
carrying out the (Cp’2NdH)2-catalyzed 
reaction with a deficiency 
of hydrogen (Le., slower stirring) results in a mixture of n-hexane 
and branched, saturated 1-hexene oligomers2 (predominantly a 
dimer). For one such experiment under D,, the n-hexane was 
found to be ca. 10% 
d3, 
72% d,, and 14% dl. Under approximately 
the same conditions, results for M = La were similar, while the 
d3 
and dl products are somewhat less abundant (ca. 6%) for M 
= Lu. A similar trend is observed for the (Me2SiCp”,MH), series. 
Isotopic analysis by I3C NMR and GC/MS of the hexene oli- 
gomers reveals in all cases species which are largely d2, 
with the 
dimer containing approximately equal quantities of CH,D and 
CHD functionalities.2’lod-f 
These results suggest that the lan- 
thanide hexyl intermediate of eq 2 can suffer several competing 
fates, shown in Scheme I: hydrogenolysis (A), allylic hydrogen 
atom transfer (B), olefin insertion (C). At sufficiently high D2 
pressures, the reaction is predicted to predominantly cycle through 
pathway A to produce n-hexane-l,2-d2 
catalytically, as observed. 
Although the scheme is drawn for a 1-hexyl product, it is im- 
possible to rule out a contribution from 2-hexyl regiochemistry,

although such a product seems less likely on the basis of steric 
and thermodynami~’~ 
considerations as well as kinetic results with 
internal hexenes (vide infra). It is conceivable that the traces of 
partially deuterated 2-hexenes observed at partial conversion could 
result from P-hydride 
elimination 
of a 2-hexyl compound. At lower 
D2 pressures, competing v3-allyl formation2 (pathway B) and 
insertion (pathway C) become significant. Reaction of B with 
D2 should yield hexane-d,, (presumably in a stepwise process). 
Scheme I also predicts that the allyl pathway should yield ap- 
proximately equal amounts of hexane-d, and hexane-d,, in accord 
with the isotopic analyses (vide supra). Pathway C will yield, after 
D2 
scission of C, saturated (C6)n-d2 
species. The spectroscopic 
information for n = 2 is in good accord with Scheme I., 
Experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of 
added THF on (Me2SiCp”2NdH)2-catalyzed 
I-hexene hydro- 
genation. When a solution in the molar ratio 220:220:1 l-hex- 
ene/THF/Nd was studied, it was found that the reaction was still 
zero-order in olefin but that k = 
0.045 atm-’ &-a 
factor of 16 
lower. Thus, any effect the Lewis base might have in altering 
k2 
or K2 
in eq 2 (e.g.. D)21cs22 
is obscured by the degree to which 
k3 
is altered. Further experiments would be required to place 
D 
this conclusion on a more quantitative footing. That a Lewis base 
can also alter the kinetics of eq 2 is confirmed by experiments 
with cyclohexene (vide infra).

hydrogenation where k2 
and K2 
are very large and hydrogenolysis 
is rate-limiting, such molecularity differences as a function of M 
would not have been discernible. When the (C~’,LaH)~-catalyzed 
hydrogenation is carried out with D,, the cyclohexane produced 
under non-mass-transport-limited conditions is 398% cyclo- 
hexane-1,2-d2 by I3C 
NMR and GC/MS.lod-f,’ 
If the reaction 
is stopped at either 15% or 80% conversion, the unreacted cy- 
clohexene 
contains traces (a. 
1%) of cyclohexene-dl. This isotopic 
distribution is suggestive of a minor P-hydride elimination pathway 
(vide infra). In the case of (Cp’,LuH),/D, 
under non-mass- 
transport-limited hydrogenation at 95% conversion, the cyclo- 
hexane produced contains large quantities of non-d2 
products: d4 
(ca. 7%), d3 
(ca. 24%), d2 (ca. 38%), and d, (ca. 25%). At 95% 
conversion, the unreacted cyclohexene contains principally cy- 
clohexene-d2 (ca. 50%) and cyclohexene-dl (ca. 50%). These 
results are best rationalized by a combination of @-hydride 
elim- 
ination-readdition sequences (eq 2 and 7) and possibly allylic 
hydrogen atom abstraction (cf., reaction B, Scheme I, and the 
ca. 1:l d1/d3 ratio observed). Since the hydride is expected to

incorporation of the label 
in the cyclohexene is expected. That 0-H elimination is more 
favorable in this secondary alkyl system is readily argued on steric 
and thermodynamic groundsIg 
as well as on the basis of empirical 
observations concerning other Cp’,MR systems where R is 
bulky.21c,22 
Under mass-transport-limited conditions (slower 
stirring), (CP’,L~H)~/D, 
gave cyclohexane which was approxi- 
mately 11% d3, 
78% d,, and 12% d, at 100% conversion. Under 
conditions of very slow stirring at 10% conversion, 
the cyclohexene 
in a ( C ~ ’ , L U H ) ~ / D ~  
reaction mixture was already 8% d,. The 
cyclohexane produced was approximately 21% d2, 47% d,, and 
31% do, the latter suggesting incorporation of the Cp’, allylic 
(Scheme I, process B), or (less likely) cyclohexane solvent hy- 
drogen atoms2Ic 
in the product at this stage in the reaction. 
The rate laws for the (Me2SiCp”,MH),-catalyzed cyclohexene 
reactions parallel the results for the lighter members of the 
( C P ’ ~ M H ) ~  
series-the 
reactions are first-order in olefin, one- 
half-order in [Lanthanide], and zero-order in P
,
,
 (eq 5). Rate 
constant data are set out in Table I. That Lu is not anomalous 
in this series is in accord with structural similarities across the 
Nd - 
Lu series deduced by infrared spectro~copy.~ 
It is also 
interesting to note that, excluding M = Lu, the catalytic activities 
for the (Me2SiCp”2MH)2 
complexes are greater than those of the 
corresponding (CP’,MH)~ 
complexes. A similar trend was noted 
in (Me2SiCp”2ThH2)2- 
vs. (Cp’2ThH2)2-catalyzed 
olefin hydro- 
genati~n;,~ 
however, the differences are even more pronounced 
for the thorium complexes. In viewing the data in Table I, it can 
be seen that general trends in activity for cyclohexene hydro- 
genation parallel ionic radius, Le., La > Nd > 
Sm > Lu (excepting 
anomalous (CP’,LUH)~). 
This is opposite the trend for I-hexene 
hydrogenation (vide infra). When cyclohexene hydrogenation by 
(Me2SiCp’’2SmH)2/D2 
was carried out with adequate stirring, 
the cyclohexane produced was 2 
98% cy~lohexane-1,2-d,.~~~-~~’ 
Experiments were also conducted in the presence of added THF. 
Under the conditions in which the overall rate of 
(Me2SiCp”2NdH)2-catalyzed 
1 
-hexene hydrogenation is reduced 
by a factor of ca. 16 (but still zero-order in olefin), the rate of 
cyclohexene hydrogenation was immeasurably slow. This result 
argues that for less reactive olefins, rate-limiting addition to the 
hydride (eq 2) can be drastically impeded (cf., D).

to determine the reaction order in hydride. 
Hydrogenation of Cyclohexene. The kinetics of cyclohexene 
hydrogenation exhibit an interesting sensitivity to metal identity 
and supporting ligation. For all complexes, the rate law is 
first-order in olefin (e.g., Figure 3) and zero-order in P H ~  
(over 
a pressure range of 0.2-1.5 atm). In the (CP’,MH)~ 
series under 
the conditions employed, the reaction is one-half-order in lan- 
thanide for M = La, Nd, and Sm, while it is first-order in lan- 
thanide for M = Lu. Figure 4 illustrates representative results, 
plotted according to the procedure of van? H ~ f f . ~ ~  
Least-squares 
analysis of these data yields orders of 0.57 (9) for La, 0.54 (9) 
for Nd, and 0.90 (15) for Lu. Rate constant data are set out in 
Table I. This kinetic behavior can be most simply interpreted 
if addition of the lanthanide hydride to the sterically shielded 
cyclohexene double bond is now rate-limiting. Previous ‘H NMR 
studies2 
indicate that (CP’,N~H)~ 
addition to cyclohexene is far 
slower than to 1-hexene under the same conditions. The kinetic 
order in the lanthanide complex most reasonably reflects the 
dissociation characteristics of the dimer. Thus, La, Nd, and Sm 
possess M(p-H),M structures,2 
and application of an equilibrium 
treatment to eq 1-3 would yield rate law (5) if k2 were rate-lim- 
iting and k, very large. I

Hydrogenation of 3-Hexyne. The hydrogenation of 3-hexyne 
was of interest since lanthanide atom-derived catalysts are very 
weakly active in reducing this substrate to cis-3-hexene 
(maximum 
Nt = 1.2 h-’ at 25 “C, 1 atm of H2) and are even less active in 
reducing the cis-3-hexene to n - h e ~ a n e . ’ ~ ~  
Experiments with the 
present hydrides would help to differentiate between the two classes 
of catalysts. In 
addition, Evans et a1.26 
have reported that several 
Cp’,Sm-derived catalysts reduce 3-hexyne to n-hexane with a 
maximum Nt = 220 h-’ (ca. 60 h-I for (Cp’,SmH),). In 
view of 
our results with other substrates and lanthanides, it was of interest 
to determine whether either the 3-hexyne or Sm was intrinsically 
anomalous. It will be seen that neither is the case. 
Hydrogenation of 3-hexyne to n-hexane by (CP’,MH)~ 
com- 
plexes, M = La, Nd, Sm, and Lu, or by (Me2SiCp”2NdH)2 
occurs 
in two kinetically and mechanistically discrete stages, which can 
be readily understood on the basis of the foregoing 1-hexene, 
cyclohexene results as well as supplementary experiments with 
cis-3-hexene. As monitored manometrically and by GC/MS, the 
hydrogenation proceeds slowly (relatively) until essentially all of 
the 3-hexyne is converted to cis-3-hexene (eq 8) at which point 
the rate of gas uptake accelerates by a factor of ca. 10. The 
relative rates for the first stage are Lu > Sm > Nd > La > 
(Me,SiCp”,NdH),, 
with N,(Sm) = 2940 & 200 h-I. Repre- 
sentative plots are shown in Figure 5, and data are set out in Table 
I. This relative ordering of rates is reminiscent of the 1-hexene 
system, as is the rate law (eq 
9), determined over the concentration 
ranges illustrated in Figure 5 (cf. eq 1-3). 
Thus, the alkyne

genolysis of what is reasonably formulated as alkenyl E is rate- 
limiting. The relative magnitudes of k, and K2 
can be rationalized 
both in terms of the steric accessibility and high unsaturation of 
the CEC bond (compared to an analogous olefin-vide 
infra) 
and the relatively large anticipated bond disruption enthalpy of 
a lanthanide ~ i n y l . ~ ~ . ~ ’  
That only the cis-3-hexene isomer is 
produced in the hydrogenation argues that free 3-hexenyl radicals 
do not play an important role.,* 
The second stage of 3-hexyne reduction, conversion of cis-3- 
hexene to n-hexane, is considerably more rapid than the first. 
Although approximate rate data could be extracted from the 
hexyne -
+
 
hexene - 
hexane data, kinetic orderings were more 
conveniently and accurately determined from independent ex- 
periments with cis-3-hexene. The situtation is reminiscent of 
cyclohexene (as were the experimental conditions) in that metal 
hydride addition to the substrate is rate-limiting, with the kinetics 
being half-order in metal for the lighter lanthanides (eq 11) and 
first-order for Lu (eq 
12). Kinetic data are given in Table I. The

reason why the hydrogenation rate appears to accelerate as 3- 
hexyne consumption nears completion is straightforwardly ex- 
plained by the kinetic results. Although hydrogenolysis of E is 
relatively slow (eq lo), k2 
and K2 
are so large that cis-3-hexene 
cannot successfully compete for M-H (it becomes more compe- 
titive as the olefin concentration increases) until the alkyne is 
nearly exhausted. 
It is interesting to note from Table I that the rate of cis-3-hexene 
hydrogenation is not as sensitive 
to the identity of M as is the rate 
of cyclohexene hydrogenation. This argues that the rate differ- 
ences for cyclohexene 
are largely steric/reactivity (k2) 
rather than 
dimer dissociation ( K , )  in origin. Our (Cp’,SmH), turnover

attention to mass-transport effects are the cause of this discrep- 
ancy. 
Hydrogenation of Other Hexenes. Exploratory hydrogenation 
investigations were also carried out with trans-2-hexene, trans- 
3-hexene, and cis-2-hexene with ( C P ’ ~ M H ) ~  
catalysts. A repre- 
sentative kinetic plot is shown in Figure 6. The rate laws for the 
former two substrates parallel the behavior of 1-hexene (eq 1-3, 
Table I), with the rate-limiting process being M-C bond hydro- 
genolysis. For trans-2-hexene, the activity trend Lu > Sm > 
Nd 
> La parallels that observed for 1-hexene. Hydrogenation rates 
for trans-3-hexene were the greatest of any substrate studied, and 
the extreme rapidity as well as only an approximate adherence 
to eq 4 introduced inaccuracy in the kinetic analysis. As can be 
seen in Table I, for constant M (La, Nd, and Sm) and rate law 
kinetic orders, the relative reactivities trans-3-hexene > 1-hexene 
> 
trans-2-hexene are obeyed. Since hydrogenolysis is rate-limiting, 
the high reactivity of a lanthanide 3-hexyl compound could 
presumably be rationalized via steric and electronic destabilization 
of the 1anthanide-C bonding. However, the relationship between 
1-hexene 
and trans-2-hexene reactivities is less easy to understand. 
In any case, these results provide no kinetic evidence that rapid 
isomerization of all three hexenes to a common lanthanide 1-hexyl 
compound precedes hydrogenation. The same is concluded from 
isotopic labels (vide infra). The kinetic behavior of cis-2-hexene 
parallels that of cis-3-hexene and cyclohexene in that the 
(Cp’,NdH),-catalyzed reaction is half-order in [Nd] and first- 
order in olefin, while the (Cp’,LuH),-catalyzed 
reaction is 
first-order in metal and olefin. For both metals, the relative 
hydrogenation rates are cis-2-hexene > cis-3-hexene >
>
 cyclo- 
hexene, which in view of the observed rate laws must be a measure 
of relative olefin reactivity with respect to a given hydride (eq 5).

that under the reaction conditions, 
migration of the initially formed 
Nd-C u bond (e.g., by P-hydride elimination and readdition) is 
not competitive with hydrogenolysis. 
Hydrogenation of Other Olefins. Several exploratory experi- 
ments were conducted with other olefins. It was found that 
tetramethylethylene could not be hydrogenated by any of the 
present catalysts at a measurable rate (25 “C, 1 atm of H2 
pressure). Using (Me,SiCp”zNdH)2 as a catalyst, it was found 
that trans-stilbene 
was rapidly hydrogenated to 1,2-diphenylethane. 
In a single experiment, neat (R)-(+)-llimonene was hydrogenated 
largely at the terminal C=C bond in 1.5 h (eq 13). Presumably

the regio- and stereoselectivity of this type of reaction could be 
modified by varying the reaction time or conditions (e.g., H2 
pressure, addition of THF). These aspects of the catalysis are 
presently under investigation. 
Discussion 
This work establishes that organolanthanides of the type 
(Cp’,MH), and (Me2SiCp”,MH), are some of the most active 
homogeneous 
olefin hydrogenation catalysts yet discovered. There 
is no evidence that oxidative addition/reductive elimination se- 
q u e n c e ~ ~  
are involved in the catalysis but rather a close coupling 
of olefin/hydride insertion (eq 14) followed by “four-center” 
hydrogenolysis’ (eq 15, drawn arbitrarily in an eclipsed confor- 
mation). We presume eq 14 to be a “cis-addition”: although

this has so far only been established for an alkyne. One interesting 
nuance introduced by f-element bond disruption enthalpy trendsI9 
(D(M-H)-D(M-primary 
alkyl) <
<

8118 J. Am. Chem. SOC., 
Vol. 107, No. 26, 1985 
Jeske et al. 
olefins, eq 14 is probably exothermic on the order of ca. 15 
kcal/mol or more. For an cy-olefin such as 1-hexene, it can be 
calculated that the rate constant for this insertion must be in exms 
of ca. 3000 M-I s-I. Assuming that essentially all the lanthanide 
is present as an alkyl, metal-carbon bond hydrogenolysis is the 
rate-limiting step in the hydrogenation. For constant supporting 
ligation, the rate constant and N, at fixed H2 
pressure for this 
process decrease almost linearly with increasing lanthanide ef- 
fective ionic radius,z9 
suggesting that higher charge/radius ratios 
accelerate the “heterolytic” activation30 
of H, (eq 15) and that 
the accompanying steric changes are not as important. These 
qualitative relationships are illustrated for 1-hexene, 3-hexyne, 
and trans-2-hexene in Figures 7, 8, and 9, respectively. It is also 
interesting to note in the 1-hexene data (Figure 7) that the nearly 
linear relationship between N, and effective ionic radius includes 
the actinide catalyst (Cp’zUH)2.z9b Rate constants for the 
M-(n-hexyl) hydrogenolysis process as high as 7700 M-’ s-l have 
been measured. The marked electron deficiency of the Cp’,M 
and Me2SiCp”, centers, which is reasonably a requisite for 
heterolytic H2 
activation, is also evident in our structural  result^.^.^ 
For bulkier olefins, eq 14 is neither as rapid nor (apparently) as 
exothermic, and the insertion reaction now becomes rate-limiting. 
In 
these cases, the qualitative sensitivity of the hydrogenation rate 
to lanthanide ionic radius is reversed, and the larger and more 
“open” (Me2SiCp”,M3) metal centers are also more reactive. The 
structural/dissociation characteristics of the hydride dimers must 
necessarily influence these trends, and the effect is most apparent 
in the case of (Cp’,LuH),, which has a different structure from 
the other (Cp’,MH), compounds as well as a different rate law. 
The results in this and the two a~companying~*~ 
papers in this 
issue also underscore the necessity of maintaining catalytic con- 
ditions in a regime where mass-transport effects are not important. 
For these organolanthanide catalysts, hydrogen “starvation” en- 
hances the role of competing side reactions such as olefin insertion 
(eq 16)2331 
and allylic hydrogen atom transfer (eq 17),2322 
as well 
as more common4 
hydrogen scrambling due to P-hydride elimi- 
nation processes. The competing insertion reaction (eq 16) is 
another lanthanide nuance which is generally rare (and/or slow) 
for middle and late transition elements.3z Interestingly, for M 
= CplzLa, R = primary alkyl, and olefin = ethylene, it can be 
calculated using tabulated ethylene sol~bilities~~ 
and approximate 
rate data in the preceding paperZ 
that the rate constant for insertion 
exceeds 12600 M-I s-I at 25 OC! This insertion process also 
exhibits a strong steric sensitivity, and the rate falls significantly 
for substituted olefins. Insertion also appears to exhibit a metal 
sensitivity, in the general direction observed for the aforementioned

rates of M-H + olefin insertion (eq 14). Likewise, the reactivity 
response on substituting Me,SiCp”,M centers for Cp”,M centers 
is similar. 
Another interesting feature of the present catalysts is the extent 
to which the metal coordination 
sphere is immobilized and screened 
by the bis(pentahaptocyclopentadieny1) 
ligation. Such a structural 
arrangement must restrict the catalytic chemistry to the 
“equatorial girdle” and necessarily imposes considerable discrim- 
ination upon the substrates which can enter into catalytic chemistry 
and the stereochemistry of the transformations that can occur. 
Future efforts will focus upon exploring the range of substrates 
which are compatible with organo-f-element catalysts as well as 
on tuning the substrate discrimination and reaction stereochem- 
istry.
