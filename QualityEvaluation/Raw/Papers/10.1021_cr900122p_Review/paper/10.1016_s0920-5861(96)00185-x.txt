Abstract 
Oxidation 
reactions 
in heterogeneous 
catalysis 
usually involve a Mars and van Krevelen 
mechanism 
which includes 
activation 
of the substrate on a metallic cation, insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygen ions, a redox mechanism 
on the 
catalyst surface, and the transfer of several electrons. It follows that such a reaction necessitates 
both acid-base 
and redox 
properties of a catalyst the acid site being of Lewis type (cations) and the basic sites being the surface O*- or OH- 
species 
which could exhibit electrophilic 
or nucleophilic 
properties. 
The active site should be able to fulfil the following requirements: 
H abstraction from the substrate, oxygen insertion, and 
electron 
transfer. 
It has been shown to correspond 
to an ensemble 
of atoms of limited size in an inorganic 
molecular 
complex. 
It could correspond 
to local structural defects 
including 
steps, kinks, coordinatively 
unsaturated 
cations or to 
clusters of atoms on the surface. Some examples are described namely: 
(i) n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride on (VO),P,O, 
catalyst where four dimers of vanadyl cations on the (100) face 
were suggested to form the active site; 
(ii) isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation 
to methacrylic 
acid on iron hydroxy phosphates 
where trimers of iron oxide 
octahedra were shown to constitute the most efficient and selective catalytic site while water was observed to be absolutely 
necessary to facilitate the reaction which corresponds 
to hydroxylated 
surface sites ensuring the redox mechanism; 
(iii) propane 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
to propene 
on VMgO samples 
which was shown to depend 
both on VO, 
arrangements 
with respect to MgO and on the basicity of the material induced by MgO while vanadium cations induced 
acidic features.

1. Introduction 
Since pioneered 
ideas by Taylor [l] consider- 
ing a single atom as active 
site in catalysis, 
several concepts 
have emerged 
considering 
in 
particular 
structure 
sensitivity 
reactions 
as pro- 
posed by Boudart 
[2]. In such a case a given 
face of a metal or an ensemble of surface atoms

of a given size were shown to determine 
the 
catalytic 
properties 
of a material. 
This 
was 
shown clearly for metals including single crystal 
faces, small metallic particles 
of a given size, 
alloying 
with another 
metal thus limiting 
the 
number of surface nearby metallic atoms of the 
same nature by the aleatory presence 
of a sec- 
ond metal [3]. For metallic 
oxides 
since pio- 
neered work by J.C. Volta et al. [4,5] in 1979 on 
MOO, single crystals many other examples 
of 
structure 
sensitivity 
have been mentioned 
on

metallic 
oxides. 
For instance 
in the case of 
MOO, single crystals 
the (100) side face was 
found very selective 
for propene 
oxidation 
to 
acrolein while the (010) basal face lead to total 
oxidation. 
It follows that it was proposed 
that 
propene 
is activated 
on the (100) face while 
oxygen 
atom supply for insertion 
resulting 
in 
acrolein 
comes from the (010) plane. This re- 
sults in (IkO) face to be the most active and 
selective face [6]. At variance for 1-butene oxi- 
dation, butadiene was formed on all basal (OlO), 
side (100) and apical (101, 101) faces while 
CO, was obtained only on the basal plane [7]. 
For isobutene 
oxidation 
methacrolein 
was ob- 
tained mainly 
on the side face (100) as CO, 
while acetone 
was formed 
on basal (010) and 
apical (101, 101) planes [7]. Another 
example 
can be found with Cu,Mo,O,, 
and Cu,Mo,O,, 
compounds 
for butene 1 oxidation 
[8]. The for- 
mer compound 
is active for isomerisation 
and 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
while the latter one 
inserts oxygen into the organic molecule result- 
ing in crotonaldehyde. 
Cuprous oxide was also 
shown to exhibit different 
properties 
depending 
on the exposed faces for propene oxidation 
[9]. 
More recently 
a molecular 
description 
of the 
active sites for oxidation 
reactions 
has shown 
up. The main simple and even naive idea is that 
the stereochemistry 
of such molecular 
surface 
site should fit that of the reactant molecule(s) 
DOI. 
Oxidation 
reactions 
usually 
necessitate 
H 
atom(s) 
abstraction, 
and 0 
atom(s) 
insertion 
from the surface into the hydrocarbon 
molecule 
and several electrons transfer. This corresponds 
to a redox mechanism, 
usually of Mars and van 
Krevelen 
type, involving 
cations which oxida- 
tion states vary during the catalytic 
cycle. The 
reaction 
mechanism 
involves 
intermediate 
or- 
ganic species which may desorb and readsorb 
on the surface in a rattle-type 
process. Depend- 
ing on the rate determining 
step (usually 
the 
first 
step 
of 
activation 
of the 
hydrocarbon 
molecule), 
the desorption 
of the intermediate 
species may be negligible which means that the 
whole reaction 
occurs at the same active site. 
Such site should then be able to provide 
the 
whole chemical 
characteristics 
for the reactant 
molecules: 
H abstraction, 
0 insertion, and elec- 
tron transfer. 
One then easily understands 
that 
its size should 
be large enough 
not only to 
accommodate 
the adsorbed reactant molecule of 
a given 
size but also to provide 
the above 
chemical 
characteristics. 
For instance 
for n- 
butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the active 
site should necessitate 7 lattice oxygens abstrac- 
tions from the substrate, 3 oxygen atoms inser- 
tions, and 14 electrons transfers. 
2. Catalysts characteristics for an oxidation 
reaction 
In order to fulfil the requirement 
of an oxida- 
tion reaction the catalyst should present peculiar 
characteristics 
which are described below. 
2.1. Su$ace defects 
This parameter 
is very important 
but rather 
difficult to characterize. 
It is clear that a more 
defectuous surface is usually more active and/or 
more selective than a well defined surface. This 
could correspond to the existence of kinks, steps, 
corners as for metallic single crystals. It could 
also correspond 
to cations with unsaturated 
co- 
ordinations 
(coordinatively 
unsaturated 
sites: 
cus) which may then be considered 
as Lewis 
acid sites and as preferential 
adsorption 
sites. 
For instance 
for n-butane 
oxidation 
to maleic 
anhydride 
(vide infra) on (VO),P,O, 
catalyst, 
the better catalyst 
is not the best crystallized 
phase obtained 
for instance 
by calcining 
the 
hemihydrate 
precursor 
above 750°C but rather 
the poorly 
crystallized 
(VO),P,O, 
phase ob- 
tained from the precursor 
by calcination 
at 400 
to 500°C. As a matter of fact it was shown by in 
situ Raman spectroscopy 
that starting from the 
VOH PO,, 0.5 H,O precursor 
and calcining it 
at increasing temperature 
under the n-butane/air 
flow maleic 
anhydride 
was formed 
when the 
(VO),P,O, 
phase 
crystallized 
simultaneously 
with VOPO, structures [ 1 
I]. Moreover, 
the ma- 
J.C. Vedrine et al./ Catalysis Today 32 (1996) 115-123 
117 
terial was at optimum 
MA yield if calcination 
was performed 
below 750°C while such yield 
decreased 
for samples 
calcined 
above 
750°C 
while crystallinity 
was improved 
[ 121. 
A high resolution 
electron microscopy 
study 
has shown that vanadyl pyrophosphate 
catalyst 
shows evidence 
of surface 
structure 
modifica- 
tion in n-butane environment 
[13]. 
2.2. SurjSace oxygen species 
The nature of the surface oxygen 
species is 
obviously 
of prime 
importance 
since it may 
favour 
electrophilic 
or nucleophilic 
attack. 
It 
corresponds 
to O-, O,, 
super 0x0 (M-O-O”), 
peroxo 
(O-O) 
(electrophilic), 
or 0x0 (M = 0 
nucleophilic) 
species related to the metal oxy- 
gen bond nature and to the heat of metal oxygen 
formation. 
Such surface oxygen species includ- 
ing hydroxyls 
are usually 
negatively 
charged, 
i.e., should exhibit basic character. 
In the well 
accepted 
Mars and van Krevelen 
mechanism, 
lattice oxygen anions are assumed to be inserted 
in the substrate 
molecule 
or to facilitate 
its 
dehydrogenation 
by forming 
H,O 
while 
the 
metallic cations ensures the redox mechanism to 
occur 
by changing 
their oxidation 
state. De- 
pending on the nature, on the oxidation 
state of 
the cation 
and on its environment, 
the metal 
oxygen 
bonds may be more or less polarised 
and then the oxygen will exhibit electrophilic 
or 
nucleophilic 
properties. 
6+

s-

The first case will favour deprotonation 
ac- 
cording to M = 0 + H + 
3 M’+-OH. 
The 
second 
case 
(weak 
polarisation) 
will 
favour homolytic 
concerted 
reactions 
as al- 
lylic dehydrogenation 
of olefins. 
The third case with electrophilic 
character 
will favour direct attack of a double bond or 
of an aromatic ring, i.e., acetone from propene 
(and even acetaldehyde 
and formaldehyde), 
anhydride from an aromatic ring. 
2.3. General features 
Catalytic properties 
for oxidation reaction on 
transition 
metal oxides 
can be considered 
in 
light of their surface acid-base 
features. 
High 
valent, incompletely 
coordinated 
metal ions or 
anionic vacancies can be regarded as acidic sites 
and oxygen or hydroxyl 
anions as basic sites. 
T. Seiyama et al. [14] have investigated 
the 
conversion 
of propylene 
to acrolein or benzene 
over a series of oxides. They have observed that 
the selectivity 
to acrolein 
increases 
with the 
electronegativity 
values while that to benzene 
increases 
in the presence 
of weakly 
basic or 
weakly acidic sites. One can consider d’ cations 
as strong or hard acids and do or d” cations 
empty or full d orbitals as weak or soft acids 
and following 
Pearson’s 
approach 
(HSBA the- 
ory) one considers 
soft acid-soft-base 
or hard 
acid-hard 
base interaction 
as being favoured 
with respect 
to hard acid-soft 
base or soft 
acid-hard 
base interactions. 
Since hydrocarbons 
such as alkanes and olefins can be considered 
as 
weak bases one may expect catalysts with strong 
acid cations, e.g., most acidic cations as V”+, 
Mo6+, W6+ to be more selective 
for propene 
partial oxidation 
than weak acid since the for- 
mer cations results in weaker interaction 
with 
propene than the latter ions. 
The following 
order was then proposed 
[ 141: 
d”: 
V”> 
Mo6+, W6’> 
Nb5+> Ti4+> Zr”+ 
d”: 
SbSf> 
Sn4+. 
High selectivity 
can be explained 
by consid- 
ering the adsorption/desorption 
steps. Acidic 
sites favour 
the adsorption 
of basic reactants 
and enhance the desorption 
of acidic products, 
thereby protecting their further oxidation to car- 
bon oxides and water. 
Summarizing 
the present state of knowledge 
of the role of acidity-basicity 
in oxidation reac- 
118 
J.C. Vedrine etal./Catalysis 
Today32 (1996) 115-123 
tion the following aspects have to be taken into 
account: 
adsorption and activation of the hydrocarbon 
molecule are related to acid-base 
interac- 
tions; 
the adsorption and desorption rates of reac- 
tants and products are also related to acid- 
base properties. 
3. Vanadyl 
pyrophosphate 
for butane oxida- 
tion to maleic anhydride 
WI 
This is an interesting example widely studied 
all over the world since it constitutes the first 
example of an industrial process of activation of 
an alkane into an oxygenate at reasonable yield. 
It has been proposed that the activation of the 
butane molecule occurs on a vanadyl dimer site 
on the (100) plane exhibiting an accessible V4+ 
cation (vanadyl pointing down) and a vanadyl 
V = 0 bond (vanadyl pointing up) as shown in 
the following scheme (from Fig. 9 in Ref. [16]). 
From the large amount of works (see a spe- 
cial issue of Catal. Today [15]) devoted to such 
a system, a concerted mechanism was proposed 
involving alkoxy intermediates [16]. A kinetics 
study has shown [17] that the reaction occurs 
according to a rattle-type mechanism but with a 
very small desorption of the intermediates. This 
implies that the very demanding reaction which 
involves 8 hydrogen atoms abstraction, 3 oxy- 
gen atoms insertion and 14 electrons transfer 
occurs in a site of limited size. Such a site 
should necessitate at least 4 vanadium atoms. 
R.K. Grasselli et al. [ 
181 suggested that the 
active sites are composed of 4 vanadyl dimers 
separated one from the other by an excess of 
phosphate ions on the surface. Such a model is 
consistent with the model proposed by Zi- 
olkowski [19] and Bordes [20]. During the reac- 
tion, a dynamic process occurs at the surface 
modifying reversibly the active site structure as 
shown by different techniques as Raman, X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopies, thermogravimetry 
and micro pulse reaction [21]. Note also that in 
situ Raman spectroscopy 
showed unambigu- 
ously that maleic anhydride was only formed 
when the precursor (vanadyl hydrogenophos- 
phate 
hemihydrate) 
was 
transformed 
into 
vanadyl pyrophosphate 
at the same moment 
when VOPO, structures were nucleated (V4+ 
and V5+ species simultaneously present) [ 
111. 
The nature of the acid sites on (VO),P,O, 
catalyst has been studied by FTIR spectroscopy 
using pyridine adsorption at 25°C. Typical Lewis 
(V = 1450 and 1610 cm- ‘> and Briinsted (v = 
i545 cm-‘) acid sites were observed [22]. The 
pyridine bands were observed even upon ther- 
mal treatment up to 300°C indicating that the 
acid sites are rather strong, the Briinsted sites 
being the strongest ones. 
A study of CO, and SO, adsorption at 80°C 
[22] to probe basic properties of the samples 
showed that basicity of such materials is rather 
weak, indicating that the first step of butane 
activation is very probably more due to acid 
sites Lewis sites as V cation or Briinsted sites 
rather than to basic sites. However the con- 
certed mechanism (vide supra) involves basic 
sites as weakly negatively charged lattice oxy- 
gen anions (OS-) allowing dehydrogenation of 
butane into butene with formation of water. 
4. Iron phosphates 
and hydroxyphosphates 
for 
isobutyric 
oxidehydrogenation 
to 
methacrylic 
acid [23-281 
Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- 
portant for the oxidative dehydrogenation 
of 
isobutyric acid @A) 
into methacrylic 
acid 
(MAA). It has been observed that the reaction 
J.C. Vedrine et al./Catalysis 
Today 32 (1996) 115-123 
119 
proceeds via a Mars and van Krevelen mecha- 
nism and that active phases had to contained 
both Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations in order to be able 
to ensure the redox mechanism necessary for 
the reaction to take place. It appears that the 
best catalysts are containing the phase Fez+Fe*+ 
(P207)2 which is composed, as schematised be- 
low, of face shearing FeO, octahedra trimers. 
Fe3+ 
Fez+ 
Fe3+ 
Such arrangement certainly facilitates the in- 
tervalency between Fe3+ and Fe*+ cations dur- 
ing catalytic reactions and thus a limited elec- 
tron hopping between Fe*+ cations. 
It was observed that the catalytic activity was 
maintained with time on stream only if a large 
excess of water vapour was present in the feed. 
An optimal value of 10 to 12 water molecules 
per IBA molecule was established. In the mean 
time it was observed that the Fe;tFe2+(P207)2 
phase, where only trimers are present, was 
formed by dehydroxylation of the hydroxyphos- 
phate Fe;+Fe2+(P030H)4 
at 420°C. This trans- 
formation was shown to be reversible. Such a 
hydroxyphosphate was also observed to be ox- 
idable by oxygen. The whole system could then 
be represented as below: 
Fez+Fe2+ (P,O,), 
Hz0 
ti Fe~+Fe*+(PO,OH), 
420°C 
02 
It could then be suggested that the active 
phase is in fact the hydroxyphosphate and that 
the active sites are composed of trimers of iron 
hydroxyphosphate. 
Such trimeric species are 
able to undergo the redox process, while the 
presence of excess water ensures the existence 
of the hydroxyphosphate phases under catalytic 
reaction which occurred near 380°C. 
Taking such a concept into consideration sev- 
eral hydroxyphosphates belonging to the FeO- 
Fe,O,-P,O,-H,O 
system have been studied 
such 
as barbosalite 
Fe~+Fe*+(PO,),(OH), 
which contains 
the same trimeric 
species, 
Fe~+(PO,),(OH), 
which contains dimers or 
Fe3’Fe2+ (PO,)0 which contains infinite chains 
of face sharing octahedra. Under the conditions 
of catalysis all the tested phases were trans- 
formed into phases belonging to a solid solution 
of the type Fe~~,Fe~~(PO,),(OH),_,,O,, 
with 
0 I x I 1. Depending upon their composition, 
these phases contained clusters of face sharing 
iron octahedra of different sizes. The more effi- 
cient catalysts contained clusters of small size 
(preferably trimeric FeO, octahedra with face 
sharing). The results obtained supported out 
above statements [26,27]. These catalysts have 
the same redox couple but different basic sites 
since O*- have been substituted for (P04j3- as 
schematized below for the active phase of the 
industrial catalyst (1) and barbosalite (2): 
Fe3(P04)x(P030H)4_, 
+ yIB.4 
+ Fe3(P0,).-2y(P030H)4-x+2y 
+ YMAA, 
(1) 
Fe4(Po4),(oH)2.400., 
+ YIBA 
+ Fe,(PO,),(OH)2.4+2,0,,,_,, 
+ YMAA. 
(4 
In the hydroxyphosphates the (P04)3- ions 
have, thus, a minor role compared to that in the 
active phase previously studied. It could thus be 
imagined that such polymeric iron oxide poly- 
hedra may exist in other systems and could 
behave similarly. As a matter of fact silicate or 
pyrosilicate anions may well be envisaged as 
counter anion in place of phosphate anions. One 
may then expect a different sensitivity to water 
and different acidic strength, presumably acid of 
lower strength. As a matter of fact Ilvaite, 
CaFe3+Fei+Si20,0(OH), 
a natural iron hy- 
droxysilicate sample has been shown to be ac- 
tive and rather selective for the considered reac- 
tion [28]. 
The structure was however not exactly the 
120 
J.C. Vedrine et al./Catalysis Today 32 (1996) 115-123 
same as that of the phosphates since it presents 
a framework of edge sharing double chains of 
FeO,OH octahedra connected by (Si,0,)6- 
groups. Sensitivity to water was much less strin- 
gent than for hydroxyphosphates 
but the cat- 
alytic performances remained inferior. Never- 
theless this result shows that the concept of 
active sites above developed can be considered 
as valid for such a reaction. 
5. VMgO catalysts 129-361 
Such a system was interesting to consider 
since it is basically composed of an acidic 
(V,O,) and a basic (MgO) oxides. One may 
then expect either to have well defined phases 
of given catalytic properties or to have such 
phases deposited on a basic support (MgO). 
Three phases are well known namely the ortho- 
vanadate Mg 3V208, the pyrovanadate Mg ZV20, 
and the metavanadate MgV,O,. The first phase 
exhibits isolated VO, tetrahedra (separated by 
MgO, octahedra), the second one has corner 
sharing VO, tetrahedra and the third one has an 
octahedral structure. The pyrovanadate phase 
was found by one of us [31] to be the more 
selective phase at equal conversion with respect 
to the other two phases for oxidative dehydro- 
genation of propane at 500°C. At variance the 
Mg,V,O, 
phase (exhibiting isolated VO, enti- 
ties separated by octahedral MgO, entities) was 
found by H. Kung et al. [30] to be more effi- 
cient for propene formation in propane oxida- 
tive dehydrogenation than the other two phases. 
A. Pantazidis and C. Mirodatos [32] recently 
found for the same reaction that propene selec- 
tivity was about the same (65 to 75%) within a 
large range in V,O, content (10 to 80 V,O, 
wt%) and at similar conversion levels. A. Corma 
et al. [33] concluded that tetrahedral isolated 
VO, species are more selective for oxidative 
dehydrogenation of C, and nC, alkanes. It then 
appears that contradictory results have been ob- 
tained resulting obviously in contradictory inter- 
pretations concerning the role of atom arrange- 
ments. 
The discrepancies between authors may arise 
from differences between samples, supposedly 
similar, and from different catalytic reaction 
conditions particularly the alkane to oxygen ra- 
tio values. 
Taking the samples prepared in our group we 
have tried to go deeper in the characterization of 
the catalysts. 
Reducibly and electrical conductivity mea- 
surements [34] have shown that the Mg,V,O, 
phase was more easily reduced than the other

two while anionic 
vacancies 
were created 
ac- 
cording to: 
C,H, 
+ O$ 
-+ C,H,(g) 
+ H,O + Vi- 
+ e-. 
Moreover, 
basicity 
of surface 
oxygen 
ions 
acts on the ability to create anionic vacancies 
and thus on the catalytic 
activity. 
Moreover 
if 
the sample contains more MgO that the above 
stoichiometries 
for pure phases one may imag- 
ine that its basicity may also play an additional 
role. The acid-base 
features 
of the catalysts 
were 
studied 
by the reaction 
of isopropanol 
conversion 
to propene (acidic feature) and ace- 
tone (basic feature) under N, in the feed and the 
redox features by the reaction 
under air in the 
feed. It was observed 
at 230°C (Table 
1 from 
Ref. [35]) that the pyrovanadate 
sample 
was 
much more basic than the other two pure phases 
and that excess MgO with respect to crystallized 
phase stoichiometry 
induced 
even more basic 
character (Table 1). 
As the olefins 
and to a lesser 
extent 
the 
alkanes are basic one may expect the propene 
desorption to be favoured by surface basic sites. 
In other 
words 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of 
alkanes 
is expected 
to be easier 
on surfaces 
exhibiting more basic properties. 
As a matter of 
fact the results given in Table 2 from Ref. [36] 
show that Mg,&O, 
which is more basic as 
shown in Table 1 is more selective for olefins in 
propane 
and to a lesser 
extent 
n-butane 
and 
isobutane oxidation reactions than the other two 
phases. Such a feature is even more pronounced 
for the samples with excess MgO at least for 
propane 
oxidation, 
samples 
which 
were also 
shown to present higher basicity (Table 1). 
It follows that one may conclude 
that basic 
properties 
as well as atomic 
arrangements 
at 
molecular level play an important role in alkane 
oxidative dehydrogenation 
reactions. 
6. General conclusions 
In the different examples chosen in this paper 
we have tried to show some important 
charac- 
teristics 
of metallic 
oxide 
catalysts 
used for 
oxidation reactions. 
Such reactions usually pro- 
ceed via Mars and van Krevelen 
mechanism, 
i.e., necessitate 
metallic cations as V, MO, Cr, 
Fe... able to change their oxidation 
state in the 
course of the reaction and lattice oxygen anions 
able to be inserted 
into the substrate, 
i.e., to 
present a sufficient 
anionic mobility 
within the 
solid catalyst. 
Acid-base 
and redox properties 
are known 
to be closely 
related 
the metallic 
cations 
considered 
as acidic 
in the sense of 
Lewis and lattice oxygen anions as basic sites. 
However, 
the acid-basic 
strength influence 
on 
catalytic 
properties 
appears to be more related 
to Pearson’s approach (HSAB) than to the usual 
approach 
features. 
Moreover, 
the influence 
of 
the basic character remains not well defined but 
to be of importance 
for oxidative 
dehydrogena- 
tion of light alkanes.

One of the main features is that the active 
sites in many reactions appear to be very effi- 
cient when they are of limited size a little like if 
the stereochemistry of the reactant molecule(s) 
and that of the surface active site have to fit at a 
molecular level. This could explain why a given 
reaction works optimally only on a given cata- 
lyst. 
Another aspect shown in this presentation is 
a peculiar role of water which is to maintain the 
catalyst surface at a state hydrated enough to 
allow the redox mechanism to occur easily. 
At last in all these oxide systems, particularly 
the supported oxide catalysts, the wetting of an 
oxide over the other (being the support or not) 
plays an important role which has not be pre- 
sented in this paper but which exists. It results 
in a rather long time of activation under reac- 
tants and catalytic conditions necessary to get 
steady state of the reaction. An example of a 
multicomponent catalyst (bismuth molybdate on 
a Co(Fe)MoO, support is given in Refs. [37,38]. 
This phenomenon occurs rather usually and is 
beneficial for catalytic reaction, presumably by 
allowing good fitting between the surface active 
site at molecular 
level 
and 
the reactant 
molecules. Unfortunately such a dynamical pro- 
cess [37-391 makes such catalysts difficult to 
characterize unless in situ techniques can be 
used.
