This contribution reports a detailed kinetic and mechanistic study of heterogeneous olefin hydro- 
genation by Cp’zTh(CH3)z 
(Cp’ = $-(CH3)5C5) adsorbed on dehydroxylated alumina (DA). For both pro- 
pylene and isobutylene, the kinetics can be accommodated by a two-step sequence: (i) olefin insertion 
into Th-H (rate 
constant 
V Z ) ;  (ii) hydrogenolysis of the resulting 
Th-alkyl bond (rate 
constant 
US). Kinetic 
data can be fit to the rate law Nt (turnover frequency) = u ~ u 3 p ~ ~ / ( u ~  
+ 
u 3 p ~ J ,  
where the reaction is zero- 
order in olefin and where u 2 / ~ 3  
= 0.55 bar-’ (-63 “C) 
and 0.47 bar-’ (0 “C) 
for propylene and isobutylene, 
respectively. Kinetic isotope 
measurements indicate Nt(H2)/Nt(Dz) 
= 1.5(1) 
for propylene hydrogenation 
at 
-63 “C and 2.0(2) 
for isobutylene hydrogenation at 
0 “C. In reaction with Dz, propylene yields exclusively 
1,2-propane-d~. 
Arrhenius activation energies for catalytic hydrogenation are 3.6(2) kcal mol-’ (propy- 
lene, -63 
to -23 “C) and 5.3(2) 
kcal mol-l (isobutylene, 
-23 to +64 
“C); 
for isobutylene, it could be determined 
that the activation enthalpies for olefin insertion and alkyl hydrogenolysis are comparable (6.2(10) and 
4.2(10) kcal mol-l, respectively). Protonolytic poisoning experiments indicate that 1 4  
f 
1% 
and 1 2  
f 
1% 
of the thorium surface sites are responsible for the bulk of the propylene and isobutylene hydrogenation, 
respectively. As a function of olefin, the relative rates of Cp’zTh(CH3)2/DA-catalyzed 
hydrogenation are 
cis-2-butene > trans-%butene > propylene > isobutylene; 1,3-butadiene yields only 1-butene 
and cis-2- 
butene as 
initial 
hydrogenation products. For several organoactinides 
supported on DA, the relative ordering 
of propylene hydrogenation activity is Cp’zTh(CH3)2

can be drawn between these observations and homogeneous solution phenomenology for similar types of 
compounds. 
Introduction 
Supporting homogeneous catalysts on suitable surfaces 
is frequently accompanied by pronounced alterations in 
activity versus that observed in 
In the case 
of early transition metall-3 and actinide hydrocarbyls4 
ad- 
sorbed upon metal oxides (e.g., alumina), enhancements 
in activity for catalytic olefin transformations are 
frequently dramatic; however, details of reaction 
mechanism and adsorbate structure have been ill- 
defined.

y-alumina (DA) are illustrative of the above sy~tem.9.~ 
Thus, 
chemisorption results in large increases in the activity for 
the polymerization of ethylene and the hydrogenation of 
simple olefins. Indeed, some of these supported complexes 
are among the most active olefin hydrogenation catalysts 
known and rival supported rhodium.“ 13C 
CPMAS NMR 
studies have shown that chemisorption involves, 
inter alia, 
the transfer of methide to A13+(cus) 
(coordinatively 
unsaturated surface) sites5 
and the formation of “cation- 
like” organothorium centers as shown schematically in eq

mechanism16 for olefin hydrogenation catalyzed by 
transition metals which involves dissociative adsorption 
of hydrogen and successive transfers of the adsorbed 
hydrogen atoms to adsorbed olefin (A).'& These transfers 
liberate free sites upon which Hz and olefin adsorb to 
continue the catalytic cycle. The exact number of metal 
atoms in a catalytic site is not known with certainty in such 
systems. 
Poisoning 
experiments with CO have revealed 
that only 
a small fraction (2-8%)12 of the adsorbed complexes, 
Cp'2An(CH3)2/DA4 or Cp2Zr(CH3)2/DA,'O become catalytic 
sites after deposition on DA and activation in flowing He 
or HZ 
at 0-150 "C. It is likely that one or more subsets 
of cation-like organothorium and organozirconium sites 
constitute the catalytic sites on alumina, but the exact 
structural characteristics defining this subset remain to 
be elucidated. 
A two-step mechanism has been tentatively proposed4c 
for the hydrogenation of olefins on Cp'zTh(CH&/DA, 
which is analogous to that previously established for lan- 
thanide Cp'2LnR complexes in solutiong 
(e.g., eqs 2 and 
3 for propylene, where L, = ancillary ligands). The 
insertion step (eq 2) is expected to be r a ~ i d , ~ p ~ J ~  
e ~ e r g o n i c , ~ J ~  
and not to involve an isolable olefin- 
hydride intermediate.l3 
However, many important kinetic and mechanistic details 
of such catalytic processes remain obscure. 
The occurrence of reactions 2 and 3 
as simple concerted 
elementary processes would constitute a mechanism of 
intriguing simplicity 
from the standpoint of conventional 
heterogeneous catalysis and would be reminiscent of the 
Eley-Rideal mechanism's for isotopic exchange between 
H2 and D2. Thus, a single organothorium site which 
alternated between ThH+ 
and ThR+ 
would be involved, 
and there would be no cus site which could dissocia- 
tively adsorb 
hydrogen 
and adsorb 
olefin. This mechanism 
contrasts with the conventional Horiuti-Polanyi

Because of the aforementioned unique characteristics 
of the Cp'zTh(CH3)2/DA olefin hydrogenation 
catalyst and 
the absence of kinetic data for any supported metal hy- 
drocarbyl 
olefin hydrogenation catalyst, the detailed kinetic 
investigation of this system has been undertaken. Careful 
attention has been paid to 
eliminating artifacts introduced 
by heat- and mass-transfer effects. Moreover, 
the results 
of isotopic labeling and improved procedures for counting 
active sites have been incorporated, 
as 
well as results with 
a variety of olefins, actinide complexes, and supports. 
Experimental Section 
Materials and Apparatus. ?-Alumina (American Cyana- 
mid, PHF, 99.99 % pure) was crushed and sieved. The 80-100- 
mesh portion was washed with distilled water to remove fines, 
then with 0.1 M HN03 
and water, dried at 100 "C in air for 12 
h, and treated in flowing gases as follows: air,600°,3;He, 
600°,1;H2,6000,2;He,60(t250,12 
(where the code indicates that 
the alumina was heated in air at 600 "C for 3 h, then in He at 
600 "C for 1 
h, etc.). The samples were rehydrated by storage 
over water at 25 "C and then dried in He,310°,2. DA was pre- 
pared by the subsequent treatment, He,950°,0.5.17L Magne- 
sium chloride (surface area = 99 m2 g-l) was supplied by Dow 
Chemical Co. and was pretreated by high vacuum 
Torr),300°,2, before impregnation. Alternatively, MgCll was 
prepared17b 
by reaction of dibutylmagnesium (Lithium Corp. of 
America) with HCl (Matheson VLSI grade) in pentane using 
greaseless high vacuum line techniques (surface area = 100 m2 
g-l). It was again pretreated by high vacuum,300°,2. SiO2- 
A1203 was Houdry Type S, 60-80-mesh material. It was puri- 
fied by the same procedure as for PHF A1203 (vide supra), 
followed by He,950°,0.5 (surface area = 66 m2 g-l). Experi- 
ments were also carried out with 60-80-mesh Davison 970 grade 
SiOZ-Al203 (13% A1203), 
which was treated in the same man- 
ner as 
the Houdry SiOz-Al203 (surface area = 
56 m2 
gl). 
SiO2- 
MgO was Grace 3M-30 grade (120-140 mesh) from which fines 
were removed, followed by He,940°,0.5 (surface area = 275 m2 
g-l). Cp'zTh(CH3)z and other organoactinides were synthe- 
sized as previously describedsbJ* and were recrystallized until 
spectroscopically pure by IH NMR. 
The alkenes employed in these studies were CP grade and 
were found to be 199.7 
% pure by gas chromatography. Mathe- 
son gases were employed, and, except for 0 2 ,  pressures were re- 
duced by valves with stainless steel membranes. At the 
entrance to the gas-handling system, UHP 
grade helium 
(>99.99% pure) was purified by passage through a trap of sil-

hydrogen was passed through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard). Cyl- 
inders of calibrated H2/He mixtures were employed in kin- 
etic order studies. The mixtures were passed through a MnO/ 
Si02 trap at -196 "C. 
Aldrich HPLC grade pentane was used as the solvent for or- 
ganoactinides during catalyst preparation (adsorption). The 
pentane was purified by three freezethaw-degassing cycles fol- 
lowed by stirring over liquid Na/K alloy for >24 h. The pen- 
tane was then transferred in vacuo into a storage flask which 
was fitted with a Teflon valve. Transfers from the solvent stor- 
age flask were made in a Vacuum Atmospheres glovebox 
equipped with an efficient atmosphere purification system. The 
olefins employed were first condensed in a bulb attached to the 
catalytic reaction apparatus. 
Since the present supported catalysts are extremely sensi- 
tive to oxygen and water vapor, extreme care in purification of 
reagents and in ensuring the absence of significant leaks is need- 
ed to secure reliable kinetic data. Contents of 0 2  
measured" at 
the entrance to the reactor (and before the MnO/SiO2 guard 
bed) were typically about 0.05 ppm. 
The vacuum line catalytic reactor apparatus and accessory 
techniques were generally similar to those described 
previously." Only greaseless valves were employed Kontes or 
J. Young Teflon valves, Nupro bellows valves, Whitey two- and 
three-way valves, and Carle four-way and six-way injection and 
switching valves. The latter valves were jacketed and purged 
with helium. The apparatus was constructed primarily of 1/4- 
in. Pyrex tubing joined by Swagelok fittings with Teflon fer- 
rules. The reactor and saturator section of the apparatus is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Preparation of Supported Catalysts. After the system in- 
cluding the saturator was purged with helium overnight, the sat- 
urator (D and E in Figure 1) 
was bypassed and the MnO/Si02 
trap (B 
in Figure 1) 
was cooled with liquid N2. About 0.25 g of 
y-alumina was weighed into the reactor. The reactor was then 
attached to the catalysis system by Swagelok unions and heat- 
ed to 950 O
C
 in flowing helium for 30 min, followed by cooling 
in flowing helium to room temperature. He,950°, 0.5 converts 
the initial hydroxylated y-alumina (HA) into a dehydroxy- 
lated alumina (DA) with a u-OH content of ca. 0.1 nm-2.17a 
Organoactinides were adsorbed on supports as follows. In the 
glovebox, the desired amount of complex was weighed (on an an- 
alytical balance) into a thoroughly dried flask equipped with a 
Teflon valve and a Solv-Seal connector. After a measured vol- 
ume of purified pentane was added, the Teflon valve was closed. 
In some cases, a 5-mL flask was employed, and its entire con- 
tents were used immediately. In other cases, a 25-mL flask was 
employed, and an aliquot was injected into the reactor. The re- 
mainder of the solution was stored in the flask at -20 "C. 
Transfer onto the support was effected by removing the flask 
from the glovebox, attaching it to the apparatus, pumping out 
the dead space, connecting a supply of helium, and removing the 
plunger of the Teflon valve attached to the flask. This result- 
ed in rapid flow of helium through the resulting entrance to the 
Langmuir, Vol. 6, No. 9, 
1990 1467 
flask. The plunger was also removed from Teflon valve H; while 
a rapid flow of helium passed through the valve, the organoac- 
tinide solution in the flask was transferred to the reactor by 
means of a thoroughly dried, evacuated gas-tight syringe. Dur- 
ing this operation, helium was passing upward through the sup- 
port. Rapid mixing of the support and the pentane solution 
ensued. Flow of helium through valve H was then continued 
until the pentane had evaporated. The catalyst was next ex- 
posed to the desired conditions of activation, usually either 
Hz,1OO0,1 
or H2,25",1. 
An alternative procedure was to weigh (in the glovebox) the 
organoactinide and dehydroxylated support into one flask of a 
double-ended reaction/fiitration 
A magnetic stir 
bar was next introduced, and the apparatus was removed from 
the glovebox and attached to a preparative high-vacuum line. 
After thorough evacuation, pentane was transferred under vac- 
uum onto the organoactinide/support mixture and the result- 
ing slurry stirred for 1 
h. The vessel was next rotated and the 
supported catalyst collected on the frit by suction filtration. The 
catalyst was then washed by transferring pentane from the fil- 
trate to the chilled catalyst zone by distillation, followed by suc- 
tion filtration. This operation was repeated 3 times, and the 
sample was finally dried in vacuo. The vessel was then taken 
into the glovebox and the solid catalyst transferred to a porta- 
ble version of the reactor shown in Figure l. Within experi- 
mental error, the two impregnation procedures yielded catalysts 
of the same activity. The latter preparation procedure has the 
advantage of indicating (by 
the presence of metal complex in the 
filtrate) whether the complex is completely adsorbed and re- 
tained on DA. 
Saturator. The saturator introduced a constant partial pres- 
sure of olefin into the reactant gas stream. It consisted of two 
tubes, D and E, as 
shown in Figure 1. D was filled with small 
glass beads and E with 40-60-mesh Filtros FS 14O.lB It was 
loaded by first condensing the olefin in a flask attached to C. Af- 
ter the saturator was evacuated and cooled with dry ice- 
acetone, three-quarters of the olefin was condensed into the 
saturator. The remaining one-quarter was discarded. Before 
use, the saturator was purged with about 40 cm3 min-* of H2 for 
about 50 min at -78 "C 
to remove any volatile impurities-02 
in particular. 
Catalytic Hydrogenation Runs. Hydrogen flow rates were 
in the range 60-120 cm3 (25 "C) min-l and most commonly 80- 
100 cm3 
mi+. 
Typically 3-13 pmol of complex (0.05-0.20 mol- 
ecule nm-*) was employed-toward 
the lower end of the range 
for propylene studies and toward the upper end for isobuty- 
lene studies. The reactor consisted of a fused silica U-tube con- 
taining a fritted silica disk to support the catalyst (G in Figure 
1). During hydrogenation, the switching valve F was set so that 
the gaseous reactant mixture passed downward through the cat- 
alyst. A bed of MnO/SiO2 was located immediately above the 
catalyst. After dehydroxylation of the alumina, but before im- 
pregnation with complex, hydrogen flow was established, and 
the MnO/SiO2 bed was heated with a torch to ca. 350 "C to re- 
duce the manganese to the green divalent state.",'@ During this 
reduction, the hydrogen flow passed upward through the cata- 
lyst. Procedures were identical for other catalyst supports. The 
temperature of the reactor was maintained constant by immer- 
sion in a suitable slush bath. Hydrogen flow was started 
through the saturator with the reactor bypassed, and then, af- 
ter 1-2 min, the flow was directed over the catalyst. This pro- 
cedure served to eliminate any oxygen which might have 
intruded into the saturator when it was filled with olefin. When 
this delay in passing the flow over the saturator was omitted, 
immediate formation of a brown layer was observed in the 
MnO/SiOz guard tube at the entrance to the reactor tube. De- 
termination of the extent of catalytic conversion& 
was effected 
periodically by injecting a sample of the effluent stream from 
the reactor into a helium flow which passed through a column 
of 33% tetraglyme on Chromosorb P and then through a Gow- 
Mac catharometer with Au/ W filaments. The column and the

were kept below 15% so as to be in the differential reactor

Kinetic Measurements. Determination of activation ener- 
gies involved a continuous run in which the temperature of the 
reactor was periodically altered by a change of the slush bath. 
So as to measure the extent of catalyst deactivation, if any, the 
last and the first temperatures were the same. 
Determination of the kinetic order in hydrogen involved 
switching among a cylinder of pure hydrogen and ones contain- 
ing calibrated mixtures of Hz and He. Cylinders with 74.2%, 
48.9%, 
20.1%, 
and 8.0% H
2
 were employed. Rates were mea- 
sured on each sample of catalyst with each HZ/He mixture at 
one or more olefin pressures. The hydrogen pressure was de- 
liberately made the same in the first and last set of measure- 
ments to check for possible deactivation. The order in olefin 
was determined by varying the partial pressure of olefin. This 
was achieved by varying the temperature (the 
slush bath) of the 
saturator. The chromatographic analysis of effluent from the 
reactor gave the ratio of the hydrogen pressure to the olefin 
pressure. Change in the olefin pressure, of course, led to a 
change in the hydrogen pressure. The gas pressure at the cat- 
alyst bed, P, 
was larger than that at the exit of the apparatus, 
Po, 
and varied with flow rate. It was measured via the Teflon 
valve H in Figure 1 
for several mixtures of H
z
 and He. At 80 
cm3 
min-l, P/Po was 5 
1.1. Knowledge of P/Po 
as a function of 
flow rate then permitted calculation of the pressures of olefin 
and H
z
 
at the reactor. The deuterium kinetic isotope effect was 
measured by alternating runs with H
z
 
and D
z
 several times in 
one continuous experiment. The first and last runs utilized hy- 
drogen to check for possible deactivation. 
Instrumentation. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic experi- 
ments were performed with a Varian XL-400 
instrument. Mass 
spectrometry was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard 
5985 GC- 
MS instrument and associated data system. Surface areas were 
measured by BET adsorption techniques with an Omicron 
Technologies Omnisorp 360 instrument operating in the con- 
tinuous mode. 
Results 
Prior to a discussion of kinetic results, it is useful to 
consider the effects on the experimental data of catalyst 
deactivation due to trace contaminants in feed gases and 
of uncontrolled temperature increases in the catalyst bed 
arising from the exothermicity of the olefin hydrogenation 
process (AH 
= -29.7 kcal mol-' for propylene),22 
the high 
turnover frequencies, and/or inefficient heat transfer. 
Catalyst Deactivation. As already noted, the present 
supported organoactinides are extremely sensitive to 02. 
A simple calculation reveals that 1 
mol of gas passes over 
a catalyst sample in a 5-h run having a flow rate of 80 cm3 
m i d .  If the catalyst sample contains a total of 5 pmol 
of Th, 
the 0
2
 level in the flowing gas must be maintained 
at 
0.5 ppm to limit the ratio Oz(total)/Th 
to 0.1. However, 
only ca. 3% of the Th sites are catalytically significant, 
and to 
maintain O2(total)/(catalytic 
sites) less than 0.1 in 
a 5-h run, the 0
2
 content of the flowing gas must be less 
than 0.015 ppm. Thus, it is not surprising that catalyst 
deactivation in a 5-h run was typically on the order of 
5-10 % despite scrupulous attention to eliminating 
adventitious poisons. This level of deactivation was 
accounted for in data analysis by linear interpolation. 
Uncontrolled Temperature Rise in the Catalyst 
Bed. In several experiments (typically those employing 
an unusually large quantity of organothorium complex in 
the catalyst preparation), an abrupt increase in catalytic 
rate was noted after ca. 10-15 min on stream. To 
determine whether this anomaly resulted from an

uncontrolled temperature rise in the catalyst bed, several 
experiments were conducted with a reactor having a 
thermocouple well penetrating the catalyst bed. In a pro- 
pylene hydrogenation experiment involving a Cp'2Th- 
(CH&/DA catalyst prepared from an atypically large 
quantity (14.3 pmol) of organothorium compound, the 
initial turnover frequency (Nt, 
moles of olefin converted 
per Th 
atom per second) was found to be 0.12 
at a bed 
temperature of -60 "C. After 15 
min, the bed temperature 
rose abruptly to +22 O
C
 and Nt rose to >0.65 s-l. However, 
with the quantities of organothorium complex normally 
employed (ca. 5 
pmol), such "runaway" temperature rises 
were small or undetectable, and in view of the low 
activation energies of the hydrogenation reactions (vide 
infra), it can be demonstrated that measured rates would 
not be affected by more than ca. 7 % .  Nevertheless, 
measurements of activation parameters for propylene 
hydrogenation at temperatures 
above ca. -20 "C could only 
be protected from these effects 
by operating 
with very small 
organothorium loadings. Since such small quantities could 
not be measured with precision, experiments were 
conducted with samples that had been poisoned with trace 
amounts of 0 2 .  It is assumed that the active sites were 
uniform and noninteracting and that the effect of the 
poisoning was to uniformly reduce the number of active 
sites. Activation parameters derived from studies of several 
samples were in good agreement. Of course, calculations 
of E, involve only rate ratios and not absolute rates. 
Because of the lower reaction rates, "runaway" temperature 
increases were not observed in isobutylene hydrogenation 
experiments, and activation energy studies could be carried 
out with unpoisoned catalysts. Under our conditions, 
mass- 
transport influences were absent. 
Estimation of the Percentage of Cp'2Th(CH&/ 
DA and /MgC12 Active Sites. In earlier 
the 
percentage of supported organoactinide sites active in ole- 
fin hydrogenation was estimated by dosing the catalyst 
with measured quantities of CO in an H2 stream, 
measuring 
the amount of CO adsorbed by the catalyst, and 
ascertaining the effect on subsequent catalytic activity. In 
all cases, CO acted as a poison, and adsorption stoichi- 
ometries indicated that 2-3 % of the Cpt2Th(CH3)z/DA 
sites are responsible for the bulk of the catalysis. This CO 
chemisorption assay provides an upper limit to the number 
of active sites. It awumes that only catalytically important 
sites adsorb CO under the reaction conditions and that a 
1:l C0:Th adsorption stoichiometry obtains. The 
poisoning chemistry presumably involves migratory 
insertion (eq 4) to produce surface s2-formyls,23 
which may 
then undergo various possible follow-up reaction~.~31~~

The uncertainties in this active-site assay warrant 
additional verification, and a complementary assay was 
devised to measure the metal alkyl content of the active 
sites for the hydrogenation of the corresponding alkene

The result for Cp’2Th(CH&/DA was that 4

of the 
Th sites form reactive n-propyl functionalties (moles of 
propane evolved/moles of Th = 0.04 (l)), 
arguing that 4 
f 
1% 
of the Th sites must be responsible for the bulk of 
the catalytic activity. This result is in agreement with the 
aforementioned 
CO poisoning results. Parallel experiments 
conducted with D20 produced propane which was 75 f

limited by the small sample 
size) propane- 
dl by mass spectrometry, supporting the quantitative 
character of the protonolysis process (eq 5). In a similar 
protonolytic experiment, 
it was found that 2 f 
1% 
of the 
Cp’2Th(CH&/DA sites catalyze the bulk of isobutylene 
hydrogenation. 
A similar poisoning experiment was conducted with 
Cp’zTh(CH3)2/MgClz. In this case, H2O was syringed 
under a He flush onto the catalyst bed at -196 “C, and 
the reactor was then warmed to room temperature to allow 
the active sites to undergo reaction with H2O. The evolved 
propane (along with traces of propylene) was measured 
as before. The number of active sites was found to be 35 
f 
10% 
of the Cp’zTh(CH& present on the support. This 
result is in good agreement with the percentage of active 
sites determined by NMR for the polymerization of eth- 
ylene using the same catalyst (50 f 
l O % ) . a 7  
The importance of the poisoning results is that they 
indicate that only a small subset of the adsorbate sites on 
alumina are responsible for the majority of the catalytic 
turnovers. Moreover, it is apparent that the turnover 
frequencies of these unique sites are far in excess of the 
measured bulk values quoted in Table I (vide infra). For 
propylene hydrogenation by Cp’2Th(CH&/DA, these Nt 
values will be at least 25 times those given in Table I. 
However, the situation is somewhat different when MgCl2 
is used as the support. In this case, a relatively large 
number of the sites are catalytically active, although each 
site is much less active than the sites formed on alumina. 
Thus, although Cp’2Th(CH&/MgClz has - 
10 times the 
number of active sites as Cp’2Th(CH&/DA, the overall 
catalytic activity for olefin hydrogenation is significantly 
less.

Hydrogenation Regiochemistry. Although earlier 
studies4c 
established by mass spectrometry that the 
predominant product of the reaction of propylene and D2 
on a Cp’zTh(CH&/DA catalyst is propane-&, the regio- 
chemistry of this process was not rigorously established 
nor was it possible to analyze the propylene exiting the 
reactor for deuterium incorporation. Therefore, the pro- 
pylene + 
D
2
 reaction was carried out under normal catalytic 
conditions (-63 “C, 
Nt = 
0.085, ca. 10% 
conversion), and 
the evolved C3 products were collected by vacuum line 
techniques and examined by 100-MHz W(’H1 NMR 
spectroscopy (Figure 2) and GC-MS. The observed 
propane NMR spectra are in good accord with those 
expected from known AC(D) parameters and coupling 
 constant^.^,^^ This indicates that the product is greater 
than 95 
% 1,2-propane-d2. GC-MS also indicated that the 
propane was propaned2 (as expected) and that the pro- 
pylene consisted exclusively of propylene-&. These results 
are in accord with regiospecific delivery of two deuterium 
atoms to the double bond (eq 6) 
and negligible label scrambling by processes such as j3-H 
elimination and readdition (e.g., eq 7) or allylic C-H 
activation (eq S).g 
Additional control experiments were run in sequence on 
8.8 pmol of Cp’zTh(CH&/DA; D2, 25 “C, 1. Nt for the 
isotopic exchange of propane at 0 or 100 “C was less than 
0.001 s-l in flow experiments in which the pressure of 
propane was 0.034 bar. 
Kinetics of Olefin Hydrogenation Catalyzed by

hydrogenation of propylene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-

established in a series of “sandwich”

Because of the relatively high boiling points of the butenes, 
it was not possible to measure rates of hydrogenation at 
temperatures below -45 OC. At these temperatures, it was 
determined that any processes resulting in isomeriza- 
tion of the unconverted butenes occurred at less than 4 
5% 
of the rate of hydrogenati~n.~' 
Measurement of the rates of hydrogenation of propy- 
lene and isobutylene at -63 and 0 " C ,  respectively, 
established that the dependence on olefin pressure was 
zero-order and that the dependence on hydrogen pressure 
was approximately first-order at low pressure. However, 
the rate increased less rapidly than expected for first- 
order behavior at higher P H ~  
For isobutylene, 
Nt under 
the same conditions differed by less than 20% among six 
samples, but in the more difficult experiments with pro- 
pylene the variation was considerably larger. Rate data 
are shown in Figures 3 and 4 where, to normalize all 
catalysts to the same basis, rates are presented as rate 
divided by rate at 
PH2 
= 1.07 bar. In Figures 3 and 4, each 
cluster of points indicates experiments with various 
Polefi 
and one HZ/He mixture. Each point represents an average 
of several measurements. For example, with isobuty- 
lene the data points near P H ~  
= 0.23 bar correspond to 
Pi&,utylene ranging from 0.0106 to 0.19 bar and near p~~ 
= 
1.1 
bar from 0.025 to 0.16 bar. The rate is clearly zero- 
order in isobutylene at 
least up to 
Phbutylene = 0.2 bar. The 
variation in Ppwylae is smaller-about a factor of 2 for each 
value of PHJPH~. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that the rate 
is effectively zero-order in propylene. Previously advanced 
arguments indicate that the rates were uninfluenced by 
diffusional effects.4c Further support for this conclusion 
results from the observation that the actual rate did not 
influence the fit of the various points in the clusters in 
Figures 3 and 4 to a model which was zero-order in ole- 
fin. For example, 
in the cluster at 
= 1.07 bar in Figure 
3, the rate ranged from 0.10 to 1.3 pmol s-l. 
The rates of hydrogenation of propylene and isobuty- 
lene on Cp'zTh(CH3)2/DA were also studied over a range 
of temperatures (-63 to -23 O
C
 for propylene; -23 to +64 
OC 
for isobutylene). Data at slightly different H
z
 
pressures 
(1.01-1.07 bar for propylene; 0.97-1.33 bar for isobuty- 
lene) were corrected to P H ~  
= 1.07 bar using the data in 
Figures 3 and 4. Arrhenius plots are shown for propy- 
lene and isobutylene hydrogenation in Figures 5 and 6, 
respectively. Derived activation energies from a least- 
squares fit to the variable-temperature kinetic data are 
E,(propylene) = 3.6(2) kcal mol-' and E,(isobutylene) = 
5.3(2) kcal mol-'. 
The hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene 
by Cp'2Th(CH&/ 
DA was studied over the temperature range -52 to +50 
(27) We find that isomerization of the unreacted butenes occurs at 
higher temperatures over neat DA.

both oxidation 
and reduction of Th(1V) are exceedingly difficult, the 
catalytic cycle will necessarily contain only species in which 
the formal oxidation state of Th is +4.28 Thus, mononu- 
clear oxidative addition (adsorption) and reductive 
elimination (desorption) processes as in eqs 9 and 10 can 
be discounted. 
(9) 
(10) 
In the most general sense and without specification of 
details, it is reasonable to assume that the catalytic cycle 
for olefin hydrogenation involves alternation between 
L,ThH+ and L,ThR+ species where R is alkyl (eqs 2 and 
3). Since the average distance between chemisorbed 
molecules of complex is large (>1 
nm) and since the Th 
atoms are sterically shielded, reaction must occur at 
single 
Th centers. 
In one impregnation 
method (see 
Experimental Section), 
catalysts were successively extracted with multiple portions 
of pentane. The resulting catalysts had normal activity. 
Thus, 
nonchemisorbed 
species which are held only by weak 
physisorption are unlikely to be catalytic sites. Such 
species could, in principle, include Cp'aThRz (R = alkyl), 
Cp'2Th(H)R, and C

complexes." 
One cannot rigorously exclude the occurrence of such 
species as 
catalytic sites at sections of the surface exhibiting 
unusually 
strong physisorption. However, other arguments 
against such nonchemisorbed species are presented below. 
CO poisoning experiments have shown that (catalytic 
sites for hydrogenation)/Th is 0.02-0.03 for Cp'2Th(CH3)2/ 
DAa4C If the catalyst operates by alternation between 
L,ThH+ and L,ThR+ species, passage of propylene over 
the catalyst would convert all of the active sites to LnTh+- 
propyl. Passage of water vapor would then liberate 
propane. Propane/Th so measured should equal catalytic 
sites/Th (cf. eqs 2,3, and 5). The measured ratio was, in 
fact, 0.04 f 
0.01. In earlier work,& a Cp'2Th(CH&/DA 
catalyst was treated in such a fashion that all sites should 
have been in the L,ThH+ form (He,0°,1;H2,1000, 
1;He,100°,1;He,250,1). Methyl chloride was then passed 
over the catalyst at 25 "C, the catalyst was flushed with 
helium, and the evolved methane was collected and 
measured. Methane would be formed by the reaction 
shown in eq 11.'8a 
L,ThH+ + CH3C1 - 
L,ThCl+ + CH, 
(11) 
The amount of CH4 should equal that of L,ThH+ and thus 
in the scheme of eqs 2 and 3 should equal the number of 
catalytically active sites. In this experiment, CH4/Th was 
0.02. This result accords reasonably well with the other 
active site counting measurements. However, since the 
temperature of the H2 pretreatment, 100 "C, was somewhat 
higher than in the other experiments 
cited here, this assay 
could, in principle, overestimate 
the number of active sites. 
Nevertheless, this result clearly demonstrates, as in the 
other assays, that only a small fraction of Cp'Th(CH&/ 
DA forms sites which react as L,ThH+ under the 
conditions employed. The reactive L,ThH+ functional-

Discussion 
At the outset of this investigation, some of the known 
characteristia of the hydrogenation 
of propylene 
catalyzed 
by Cp'2Th(CH&/DA were as follows: (i) the reaction is 
too rapid for convenient study, even at -63 "C4 (ii) As 
assayed by CO poisoning, only a small fraction (-0.02- 
0.03) of the molecules of thorium complex become catalytic 
sitesS4 
(iii) 
The catalyst is extremely sensitive to poisoning 
by 0
2
 and H20; adsorption of these species must be strong 
and involve large sticking 
 coefficient^.^ (iv) The catalytic 
activity of Cp'zTh(CH&/DA is far greater than that of 
Cp12Th(CH3)2 
in hydrocarbon solutions4 but roughly 
comparable to that of (Cp'2LnH)z complexes (Ln = lan- 
thanide) in hydrocarbon  solution^.^ (v) The reaction of 
propylene + D2 yields propane-d2 of unknown 
regio~hemistry.~ 
(vi) CPMAS NMR spectroscopy reveals 
the transfer of Th-CH3 groups to surface sites and the 
formation of cation-like "Cp'2ThCH3+" species8 
in the cases 
of Cp'2Th(CH3)2/DA6 
and Cp'~Th(CH3)2/MgCl2.6~J 
(vii) 
A much larger fraction of the thorium sites is catalytically 
significant for the hydrogenation of propylene in the latter 
system; however, the catalytic activity of the sites is far 
(28) In regard to trivalent species, ESR spin-counting 
studiea 
of formally 
analogous organozirconium catalysts indicate that only ca. 0.03% 
of the 
metal centers exist as 
ESR-detectable Zr(1II) 
sites after activation in H*.lO

ities measured here are in all likelihood catalytic sites, but 
that has not been rigorously proved. 
Since a reaction mechanism is a theory, the exact identity 
of the Cp’zTh(CH3)2/DA active sites for hydrogenation 
cannot be rigorously established. The problem is 
particularly difficult in the present case, because the 
concentration of active sites on DA is very small, and any 
spectroscopic signals from them are apt to be obscured by 
signals from the much more abundant noncatalytic surface 
species. However, we believe that, by the process of 
elimination, a strong plausibility case can be made that 
the catalytic site precursor is some form of Cp’zThCH3+. 
Nevertheless, the combined chemical and NMR 
spectroscopic active site assays& 
indicate that only a small 
subset of the “cation-like” adsorbate species can be 
catalytically significant on DA. This presumably reflects 
the known5 irregularlity of such surfaces and the 
multiplicity of cation-anion environments which would be 
possible. 
On the basis of known solution and surface chemistry, 
it is possible largely to exclude the following species as 
effective active sites for the hydrogenation of olefins at 
low temperatures. 
(i) Physisorbed Cp’zTh(CH3)z. This molecule is a poor 
catalyst in solution.18a 
(ii) Physisorbed Cp’2Th(CHs)H. Were this the catalyst, 
it would react with olefin to 
form Cp’2Th(CH3)R.l3J” But 
this, like Cp’2Th(CH&, would be a poor catalyst. 
(iii) 
Cp’zTh(CH3)0-. Isotopic-labeling 
experiments show 
that Cp’2Th(CH& reacts with the residual OH, of DA 
(-0.1 nm-2) during the step, He, 0 “C, of catalyst 
preparation to liberate methane via eq 
Cp’,Th(CH,), + OH, - 
Cp’,Th(CH,)O- + CH, 
(12) 
By experiment, CH,/Th is 0.11. The p-oxo protonolysis 
product B is analogous to Cp’zTh(R)OR 
species, which by 
virtue of the r-donating alkoxy ligand are poorly reactive 
in solution with respect to hydrogenolysis.’“ Furthermore, 
species of type B are directly observable by NMR in 
addition to the predominant, cation-like adsorbate on 
Cp’zTh(CH3)~/MgC12 
when the MgC12 has been exposed 
to traces of water. In direct competition experiments 
monitored by NMR, species B is found to be far less 
reactive with respect to olefin insertion and hydrogenol- 
ysis than the cation-like component.6a On partially de- 
hydroxylated alumina and a variety of silicas, CPMAS 
NMR shows the absence of cation-like species and only 
adsorbates of structure B.6a Such materials are inactive 
for olefin hydr~genation.~ 
(iv) Cp’[ $- 
(CH3)&CHz]ThCH3. 
Isotopic-labeling 
studies of methane eliminationk show that a species 
of this 
composition is produced in - 
5 % yield upon deposition 
of Cp’zTh(CD3)z on DA during He, 0 “C. From what is 
known about the solution chemistry of @-(CH&C~CHZ 
c ~ m p l e x e s , ~ ~ ~ * ~ ~  
hydrogenolysis should yield Cp’zTh(H)- 
CH3, or Cp’zThH+ if the precursor is cationic. These 
species should function catalytically as discussed above. 
(v) Cp’zThCHZ. Methane elimination studies4c 
of 
Cp’zTh(CH3)2 + DA also implicate a species of this 
constitution (- 1% 
yield), for which there is precedent in 
group 4 
chemistry (C).30 Furthermore, this species 
undergoes reaction (methylene transfer9 with acetone to 
yield isobutylene, and this reaction is largely blocked by 
CO adsorption. It is likely that such an actinide alkyli- 
dene would react with hydrogen to yield Cp’ZThH+ and 
HA1-; however, the rate is not known. CPMAS NMR 
experiments indicate that >90% of the Al-CH3 groups of 
Cp’zTh(CH3)2/DA are inert to hydrogenolysis.6

It may appear curious that eq 16 is in the same form 
as the Langmuir adsorption isotherm in view of the fact 
that the Langmuir isotherm represents an equilibrium 
phenomenon and eq 16 is derived from an irreversible 
sequence. Further, of course, this mechanistic 
variant does 
not involve a formal rate-limiting step. 
The kinetic data for the hydrogenations of propylene 
and isobutylene are plotted in Figures 
3 and 4, respectively, 
as the rate divided by the rate at P H ~  
= 1.07 bar vs PH~.

which follows from eq 16. The fit to eq 17 is excellent. 
Derived values of U Z / U 3  for the hydrogenations of propy- 
lene and isobutylene are 0.55 bar-’ (-63 “C) 
and 0.47 bar-’

The fits to eq 17 accord with the implicit assumption 
that UZ/U3 is independent of a

 They also establish that 
the hydrogenations are essentially zero-order in olefin in 
the range of Polefm examined. The reduced x2 
values% 
for 
the fit of data to eq 17 are good, 1.16 for propylene and 
0.91 for isobutylene. However, the fit to zero-order in ole- 
fin and first-order in hydrogen is poor, 5.1 and 4.8, 
respectively. The fit is also poor to the conceivable 
eq 18, 
1.6 and 4.6, respectively.

For the above model, the Arrhenius activation energies, 
3.6(2) for propylene and 5.3(2) kcal mol-l for isobutylene 
hydrogenation, would be composite quantities and would, 
in principle, vary with P H ~ .  
Therefore, the Arrhenius plots 
should not give perfectly straight lines. Table V gives 
values of uz and u3 for the hydrogenation of isobutylene

one sample of Cp’zTh(CH3)2/DA in one continuous run.

and AH’3 was 4.2(10) kcal mol-’ for eq 3. Because of 
catalyst deactivation (which necessitated correction by 
interpolation between initial and final runs) and because 
it was difficult to secure conditions under which conversion 
was low at 27 “C and yet still accurately measurable at 
-10 “C, these values are not of high accuracy. However, 
to a fair approximation it appears that “2,

is concluded that, as in the foregoing discussion of 
Cp’zThCHa+, only a small subset of Cp’zThH+ sites can 
be catalytically significant. 
The above considerations allow reasonable rejection of 
the bulk of the above species as catalytic sites. They are, 
however, compatible with paragraph v and certain subsets 
of paragraphs iv and vi being either the precursors of or 
actual Cp’ZThR+/Cp’zThH+ 
catalytic sites. 
In agreement with the above results, CPMAS NMR 
spectroscopic studies of Cp’zTh(CH3)2/DA reactivity 
indicate that only a small fraction of surface sites having 
”cation-like” 
signatures are reactive with respect to eth- 
ylene insertion or hydrogenolysis (510% 
).6a In contrast, 
the same NMR assay for Cp’zTh(CH&/MgClz indicates 
that 50 f 
10% of the ”cation-like” 
adsorbate centers are 
active with respect to ethylene insertion and a roughly 
comparable percentage with respect to hydrogenolysis.6c 
The present poisoning studies show that 35 f 
10% of 
Cp’zTh(CH3)z/MgClz sites are active for propylene 
hydrogenation, which is in reasonable agreement with the 
NMR assay. Although these Cp’zTh(CH3)2/MgClz active 
sites are significantly less active for olefin hydrogenation 
than those of Cp’zTh(CH&/DA, they are considerably 
more active than Cp’zTh(CH3)z 
in solution ( 
-200X).1&9b 
Kinetics of Olefin Hydrogenation Catalyzed by 
Cp’2Th(CH3)z/DA. As is usual, several different 
mechanistic variants can lead to the rate data and the 
equations which fit them (see Figures 3 and 4). A general 
factor in all variants results from the low temperatures at 
which the kinetic studies were effected, temperatures 
necessitated by the very high activity of the catalyst. During 
hydrogenation of propylene at 
-63 to 
-35 “C 
and of isobu- 
tylene near 0 “C, approximately a monolayer of phys- 
isorbed olefin will have covered the entire surface of the 
catalyst31 since PIP0 will be about 0.1, where PO 
is the 
saturated vapor pressure of the adsorptive at the 
temperature of adsorption. Thus diffusion of olefin on the 
surface will not have influenced the rate of hydrogenation. 
Further, over a substantial range of Polefin, the rate of eq 
2 should be independent 
of Polefin, 
since olefin should react 
from the physisorbed state which covers the catalyst. Since 
isomerization is less than 4 9
2
 of hydrogenation in the case 
of butenes and since hydrogenation of propylene with DZ 
forms only CHzDCHDCH3 
with negligible label exchange 
into propylene at partial hydrogenation, eq 2 is nearly 
irreversible. Since no detectable exchange occurs when 
propane plus D
z
 
is passed over the 
eq 3 is also 
irreversible. 
In the simplest mechanistic variant, eqs 2 and 3 are 
concerted, 
and neither olefin nor Hz becomes coordinated 
to the Th ion of the active site during the catalytic cycle. 
Equations 2 and 3 must be assumed to be irreversible. 
Then, rz (the subscript refers to eq 2) for the insertion 
reaction will be independent of Polefin 
and given by eq 13

E, are roughly equal and that Y Z / V ~  
varies little with 
temperature. From the above considerations, it will be 
apparent that the measured H2/D2 kinetic isotope effects 
(vide supra) are also composite quantities. 
The elementary steps of the mechanistic variant just 
considered, eqs 2 and 3, involve reaction of olefin from the 
physisorbed state and Hz from the gas phase. One might 
suspect that there would also be a mechanistic variant in 
which olefin and Hz are first chemisorbed at Th and then 
undergo reaction, and indeed there is (eqs 19-22). 
Distinction between the concerted and the chemisorbed 
intermediate models cannot be made on the basis of the 
present kinetic data but will require other kinds of data. 
As before, eqs 20 and 22 must be assumed to be irreversible. 
AH for eq 19 must also be rather large and negative if K19 
is to be large. It may not be possible for both AH*19 and 
M * 2 0  
to be large. Equation 21 constitutes a preequilib- 
rium with Kzl so small that [ThR(Hz)] is in the Henry's 
law range. Furthermore, the equilibrium constant for eq 
23 must be assumed to be very small (except for ethyl- 
ene, in which case ethylene insertion into Th+-R must be 
rapid since polymerization is rapid in the absence of HZ 
at 25 0C).4c 
The concentration of (HZ)-.Th+-H 
must also be assumed 
to be very small. It then follows that eqs 24-27 obtain 
where ThR+/(total catalytic sites) = a, 
and in form, eq 
27 is equivalent to eq 16. Comments on solution precedent 
for f-element 
olefin and dihydrogen 
complexes 
will 
be made 
in the following section.

While the role of basic oxide functionalities in this scenario 
might help to rationalize the high activity of DA-supported 
catalysts, it should be noted that (Cp'zLnH)z catalysh have 
comparable olefin hydrogenation activities in nonpolar 
 solution^.^ Furthermore, eq 30 is not consistent with 
solution-phase 
group 4 data indicating that hydride ligands 
undergo protonolysis far more rapidly than do alkyls.29 
As 
written, it is not clear whether eqs 28 and 29 would be most 
consistent with a small percentage of active sites or that 
such sites would be kinetically equivalent (the rate 
constants for adsorption and desorption would be 
independent of a). Making assumptions similar to those 
of the first mechanistic variants, equations of a form 
equivalent to that of eq 16 result. 
Another possible role for oxide surfaces might be to 
facilitate, via secondary 
interactions, actinide-carbon bond 
hydrogenolysis (eq 2), which is presumed to proceed via 
a four-centered heterolytic transition state (D, E).3536 
Solution-phase 
data bearing on this question are presently 
sparse; however, it is noteworthy that for Cp'zTh(0-t-

for Cp’2Th(O-t-Bu)H/D + cyclohexene, 
kH/kD = 1.4 (l), 
AH* = 9.0(5) kcal mol-’, and AS* = 
-47.20) eu. Addition 
of Cp’zTh(O-t-Bu)H 
to cis-2-butene initially yields the sec- 
butyl complex, which then slowly undergoes isomeriza- 
tion to the n-butyl complex (eq 31). 
Hydrogenation of Butenes. Hydrogenation of the 
2-butenes (Table I) was so rapid that it was impossible to 
determine rates under conditions not influenced by mass 
and heat transfer. Our best estimate is that the rate of 
hydrogenation of trans-2-butene 
is ca. 10 
times that 
of pro- 
pylene. As u3 increases indefinitely, 
Nt approaches u2 (eq 
16) or uzo (eq 27). Nt for propylene is about 0.4~2 
at P = 
1 
bar. Thus, were u2 the same for propylene and trans- 
2-butene, an increase in u3, no matter how large, could 
increase Nt by no more than a factor of 2.5. Hence, both 
u2 and u3 must be larger for the 2-butenes than for pro- 
pylene. This reactivity pattern has some precedent in 
homogeneous organo-f-element chemistry (vide infra). 
As shown in Table 1
1
,
 the products of hydrogenation of 
butadiene are l-butene, trans-2-butene, and butane, 
although the latter is probably a secondary product. No 
cis-2-butene was detected. The hydrogenation of buta- 
diene is considerably 
slower than that of the 2-butenes but 
nearly 3 times faster than that of isobutylene. The small 
ratio, rdiene/r2-ene, 
requires u3 to be smaller for the diene, 
but uz might be larger or smaller. These results can be 
rationalized by comparison with the results of 
hydrogenation of butadiene by homogeneous lanthanide 
complexes (vide infra). 
Comparison 
to Homogeneous Systems. In regard to 
potentially analogous solution-phase 
chemistry, it should 
be noted that olefin hydrogenation by Cp’2Th(CH3)2 or 
its ultimate hydrogenolysis product, [Cp’zTh(p-H)H]z, 
is 
considerably slower than when these species are ad- 
sorbed on DA.lsb For l-hexene in hydrocarbon solution 
at 25 “C ( P H ~  
= 1.0 bar), 
Nt = 0.58 h-l (0.00016 s-l). This 
quantity can be compared with a value for propylene 
hydrogenation by Cp’2Th(CH&/DA at -45 “C (or by 
[Cp’zTh(p-H)H]z/DA 
at 
-63 O
W
)
 
of ca. 3-4 s-l per active 
Th 
site. Such rate orderings appear to be consistent with 
the lower coordinative saturation and greater electro- 
philic character expected for a free “Cp’2ThCH3+” 
species.8 
Interestingly, the rate law for the homogeneous 
hydrogenation of l-hexene by [Cp’zTh(p-H)H]2 
is similar 
to that of the heterogeneous reaction, Le., zero-order in 
olefin, first-order in thorium, but first-order in hydrogen 
over the entire range PH* 
= 0-1.2 bar.lsb These 
observations 
are readily accommodated by a scenario such 
as eqs 2 and 3, where olefin insertion is rapid and 
irreversible (confirmed by solution NMR experimentslsb 
and consistent with bond enthalpy datal4). However, in 
the homogeneous 
case, saturation effects are not observed 
at higher pressures of Hz, and there is no analogue to the 
physisorption of olefin at low temperatures. 
Further information 
on thorium-centered 
olefin insertion 
and alkyl hydrogenolysis 
processes in solution is provided 
by recent kinetic/mechanistic studies of reactions of 
Cp’2Th(OR)Hl3 
and Cp’zTh(0R)R’ 36 complexes. Ole- 
fin insertion reactions of the former compounds are 
kinetically first-order in thorium, first-order in olefin, and 
extremely sensitive to the steric bulk of R and the 01efin.l~ 
For Cp’2Th[OCH(t-Bu)z]H/D 
+ l-hexene, 
k H / k D  = 1.3 (2); 
Hydrogenolysis of Th-R’ in Cp’nTh( 
0R)R’ complexes 
is kinetically first-order in thorium and first-order in Hz, 
with kH2/kD,, = 2.5(4), AH* 
= 3.7(2) kcal mol-’, and A s *  
= -50.8(7) eu for R = t-Bu and R’ = CHzC(CH3)s. 
Although 
these homogeneous systems 
are apparently more 
coordinatively saturated than the active sites in Cp’zTh- 
(CH3)2/DA, it can be seen that some similarities are 
exhibited in reaction rate laws, kinetic isotope effects, 
sluggishness of alkyl isomerization, and especially in hy- 
drogenolysis activation enthalpy. 
Parallels are also apparent between the supported or- 
ganothorium complexes and homogeneous organolan- 
thanide hydrogenation catalysts of the type (cp’zLnH)~.~ 
In hydrocarbon solution at 25 “C, 
= 1.0 
bar, the latter 
complexes exhibit Nt values for l-hexene hydrogenation 
varying from 5.9 (Ln = La) to 33 s-l (Ln = Lu). Under 
the conditions investigated, the rate law is first-order in 
lanthanide, zero-order in olefin, and first-order in Hz. As 
for the hydrogenations with [Cp’zTh(pH)H]2 (vide su- 
pra), these results are in accord with eqs 2 and 3, where 
olefin insertion is rapid and irreversible. Saturation effects 
are not evident in the homogeneous kinetics at PH* 
up to 
1.2 bar, suggesting, as the simplest explanation, that UZ/ 
u3 is larger in the homogeneous case. Steric impediments 
to olefin insertion at surface sites or higher surface cation 
hydrogenolytic reactivity are plausible explanations. 
Labeling studies reveal that D2 addition to l-hexene is re- 
giospecific in the regime where Dz delivery to the reactor 
is not mass transport limited.g In regard to activity for 
the hydrogenation of internal olefins, the homogeneous or- 
ganolanthanide catalysts exhibit the ordering trans-3- 
hexene > l-hexene > trans-2-hexene. In the case of cis- 
2-hexene and cyclohexene, the reactions are somewhat 
slower, and the rate law becomes one-half-order in lan- 
thanide, first-order in olefin, and zero-order in Hz. Thus, 
olefin insertion is now rate-limiting. For the first three 
olefins where hydrogenolysis (eq 3) is turnover-limiting, 
the high reactivity of the internal olefins is in accord with 
other observations that Th-R’ hydrogenolysis in Cp’zTh- 
(OR)-R’ compounds is not particularly sensitive 
to steric 
factors36 and that it is more rapid for systems (e.g., 
secondary alkyls) expected to have lower Th-R’ bond 
enthalpie~.~~ 
While a strict 1:l congruence between the 
above homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems 
does not exist, it is interesting to note that rate laws are 
similar and that both catalysts exhibit cases where internal 
olefins are more reactive than terminal olefins. 
As noted above, the rate of hydrogenation of butadi- 
ene on Cp’2Th(CH&/DA is considerably 
slower than that 
of either 2-butene isomer (Table I) but ca. 3 times faster 
than that of isobutylene. Of the two possible 2-butene 
products, only the trans isomer is detected. Although the 
kinetic orders and a 
values for this reaction have not been 
measured, the turnover frequencies and product 
distributions can be qualitatively 
rationalized on the basis 
of known (Cp’2LnH)z + 
diene chemistry: which involves 
formation of more coordinatively saturated (i.e., less 
reactive) $-allyls, and in the case of butadiene, formation 
of the syn-~+crotyl 
product (cf. G, eqs 32 and 33).

Other Organoactinide Complexes and Supports. 
Table I11 shows catalytic results for propylene 
hydrogenation catalyzed by a number of organoac- 
tinides adsorbed on DA. The result with the substituted 
uranocene 
is explicable in terms of the difficult accessibility 
of an actinide hydride functionality, necessary to initiate 
the catalytic cycle. The activity of Cp’zTh(CH3)(03SCF3) 
suggests that Cp’zThCH3+ sites are formed on the DA 
surface. The experiments with supported MezSiCp”2An 
complexes (Cp” = ~~-(CH,),Cs)were 
motivated by 
observations that in homogeneous solution [MezSiCp”zTh- 
(pH)& is far more active than [Cp’zTh(p-H)H]z 
in ole- 
fin hydrogenationlab 
and that (MezSiCp”2LnH)z 
complexes 
are more active than (Cp’2LnH)z complexes in the 
polymerization 
or hydrogenation of sterically encumbered 
01efins.~ 
The present heterogeneous results evidence no 
unusual activity for the Me2SiCp”zAn-derived catalysts. 
It appears that the steric 
environment provided by the DA 
surface may play at least as great a role as modifications 
in ancillary cyclopentadienyl ligation in modulating 
catalytic activity. Further information awaits additional 
kinetic and mechanistic studies. 
It was also of interest to investigate the catalytic 
properties of Cp’zTh(CH3)z 
adsorbed on supports offering 
a variety of surface functional groups. Marginal activity 
for propylene hydrogenation on partially dehydroxy- 
lated alumina and silica can be explained both in terms 
of extensive destruction of Th-CH3/Th-H bonds via 
proton~lysis~~ 
and the stereoelectronic consequences of 
forming aluminoxy- and siloxyalkyls (I 
and J, 
verified by 
CPMAS NMR6144). 
As noted already, alkoxy ancillary 
ligands are known to greatly depress the reactivity of ac- 
tinide alkyls with respect to hydrogenoly~is’~-~~ 
and of ac- 
tinide hydrides with respect to olefin insertion.13 In the 
case of dehydroxylated silica, the diminished catalytic 
activity of adsorbed Cp’zTh(CH3)z can be attributed to 
species such as K,& 
formed by addition of Th-CH3 across 
surface Si-0 bonds.

For Cp’zLn(v3-allyl) 
complexes, 
reaction with Dz yields the 
corresponding 
although it is not known 
whether this reaction occurs in a concerted manner. The 
heterogeneous 
data (Table 11) suggest 
that alkenes are the 
primary hydrogenation 
products of this reaction (assuming 
a single mechanism is operative). The product isomer 
distribution is consistent with reaction predominantly via 
the syn-q3-crotyl complex (G,

In the case of MgC12, NMR studies indicate the 
formation of “cation-like” 
surface sites (e.g., L) 
that ca. 50% of the Th+-CH3 functionalities are reactive 
with respect to ethylene insertion (on warming from -196 
to 0 oC),6aJ 
and that comparable quantities undergo hy- 
drogenolysis at 25 “C. The present catalytic results 
indicate significant but not extremely 
high activity for pro- 
pylene hydrogenation by Cp’zTh(CH&/MgClz (- 200 X 
Cp’zTh(CH3)z 
in solution) and that active site percentages 
(35 f 
10%) 
are in reasonable agreement with the 
aforementioned NMR results. Interestingly, NMR 
experiments also indicate that ca. 100% of the Th-CH3 
groups undergo reaction with CO at 
25 OC.& Table IV also

is active for pro-

pylene hydrogenation but less so than Cp’2Th(CH3)2/ 
DA. Although 
kinetic and poisoning data 
are not available, 
it is noteworthy that NMR datasa 
indicate the transfer of 
methyl groups to both surface aluminum and silicon sites, 
yielding both “cation-like” (eq 1) 
and siloxy (K) 
adsorbate 
sites. 
The present findings further underscore the remarkable 
properties of the Cp’2An(CH&/DA active catalytic sites 
yet also leave many questions unanswered. Only a small 
subset of the cation-like Cp’zAn(CH&/DA adsorbate 
species exhibits high catalytic activity. In contrast, 
other 
supports (e.g., MgC12) which afford spectroscopically 
cation- 
like adsorbate complexes and which give rise to a much 
higher percentage of sites which are catalytically active 
for olefin hydrogenation do not display the high activity 
of Cp’2An(CH3)2/DA. The reason may reflect subtleties 
of alumina topography and surface coordination 
chemistry, 
which give rise to a subset of particularly unsaturated/ 
exposed “Cp’2AnCH3+” 
moieties (e.g., at 
steps and edges). 
Alternatively, the Lewis acidic and basic sites of the 
alumina surface5 may play a more direct role in the 
catalytic chemistry as depicted in eqs 28-30 and structures 
E and F. At present, however, the evidence is not 
compelling. 
Langmuir, Vol. 6, No. 9, 1990 1477 
Conclusions 
The results of this kinetic and mechanistic study 
underscore the strong similarities and subtle differences 
between the catalytic chemistry of adsorbed organo-f- 
element complexes and those of similar complexes in 
solution. Gross mechanistic aspects of catalytic 
heterogeneous and homogeneous olefin hydrogenation 
exhibit distinct congruencies. Although the exact 
geometries of the catalytically 
active adsorbate sites remain 
speculative, the present results further support the 
hypothesis that one key role of Lewis acid supports is to 
promote the formation of less coordinatively 
saturated and 
more electrophilic species. That such a surface 
environment should promote such high catalytic activity 
is indeed remarkable.
