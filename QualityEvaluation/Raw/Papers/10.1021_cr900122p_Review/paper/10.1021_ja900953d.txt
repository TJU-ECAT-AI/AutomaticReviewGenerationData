Abstract
Deuterium labeling studies indicate that base-induced intramolecular C−H activation in the agostic complex 2-D proceeds with exclusive removal of a proton from the methyl arm of an iPr substituent on the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Computational studies show that this alkyl C−H bond activation reaction involves deprotonation of one of the C−H bonds that is geminal to the agostic interaction, rather than the agostic C−H bond itself. The reaction is readily accessible at room temperature, and a computed activation barrier of ΔE‡calcd = +11.8 kcal/mol is found when the NHC 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene is employed as the external base. Charge analysis reveals that the geminal hydrogens are in fact more acidic than the agostic proton, consistent with their more facile deprotonation.

Agostic complexes are widely recognized in transition metal chemistry and are often postulated as transient intermediates on the pathway to C−H activation. (1) C−H bond cleavage may proceed via oxidative addition, σ-bond metathesis, or electrophilic activation. (2) In the last case, interaction with an electron-deficient metal center is thought to confer enhanced acidity on the agostic C−H bond and heterolytic cleavage can occur, often facilitated by an external base. (3) Herein, we report the base-induced C−H activation of an agostic Ru−N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex which, contrary to expectation, proceeds not at the metal-bound C−H agostic but rather at a C−H bond geminal to the agostic interaction.
Addition of 1.9 equiv of either HBF4 or HOTf to a THF solution of the previously reported (4) C−H activated complex Ru(IiPr2Me2)′(PPh3)2(CO)H, 1, resulted in the facile formation of the BF4− and OTf− salts of the cationic monohydride complex [Ru(IiPr2Me2)(PPh3)2(CO)H]+ (2, eq 1). (5) An X-ray crystal structure determination of the BF4− salt (Figure 1) revealed a distorted octahedral geometry with trans PPh3 groups and an agostic interaction occupying the sixth coordination site involving the metal and a C−H bond of one of the N−iPr methyl groups on the carbene. The agostic Ru−C distance (Ru(1)···C(7), 2.825(7) Å) is more than 0.75 Å shorter than the next nearest interaction with an isopropyl carbon (Ru(1)···C(10), 3.591(5) Å), with both the Ru(1)···H(7B) distance (2.05(1) Å) and Ru(1)···H(7B)−C(7) angle (134.8(4)°) in the expected range by comparison to literature precedent. (6) Evidence for the agostic interaction in solution was provided by 1H−13C HMBC spectroscopy, which showed a correlation between the Ru−H signal and one of the two 13C methyl resonances (see Supporting Information, SI). The 1H NMR spectrum proved uninformative as the two sets of iPr methyl and methine signals seen at 298 K simply broadened upon cooling to 195 K.

Deprotonation of 2 by strong bases (IiPr2Me2, KOtBu, or KN(SiMe3)2) led to C−H activation to give 3, an isomer of 1 with trans PPh3 ligands (see Figure 1 for the X-ray crystal structure). To assess the mechanism of C−H activation we prepared the Ru-deuteride, 2-D, by reaction of 1 with DOTf. (7) Deprotonation of 2-D with KN(SiMe3)2 gave exclusively 3-D, indicating that C−H activation in 2-D does not involve deprotonation of the metal center but rather removal of a proton exclusively from one of the iPr arms.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (8) have been employed to investigate the mechanism of formation of 3 from 2. Initial studies focused on a model system comprising [Ru(IiPrMe)(PMe3)2(CO)H]+ (2′) and IMe2 as the external base. (5) Our choice of an NHC as the base was motivated by our interest in the role that these species may play in forming C−H activated complexes in a wide range of TM-NHC systems. (4, 9) The Ru−ligand distances within 2′.IMe2 show good agreement with the experimental structural data for 2 (see Figure 2a). In particular, the short Ru···H1 contact (2.01 Å) and elongated C1−H1 bond (1.14 Å) are consistent with an agostic interaction. A close contact to the external IMe2 molecule is seen, but this actually involves the C1−H2 bond (C2···H2 = 2.40 Å) and not the agostic C1−H1 bond. A lengthening of the C1−H2 distance to 1.12 Å is also computed, suggestive of a weakening of this bond. Indeed a reaction profile varying the C2···H2 distance led to the location of a transition state (TS(2′−3′).IMe2, E = +12.7 kcal/mol) featuring significant C1···H2 bond elongation (1.64 Å), a shorter C2···H2 distance (1.27 Å), and a shorter Ru···C1 distance (2.63 Å). Interestingly, the original agostic interaction appears reduced on the basis of a longer Ru···H1 distance (2.13 Å) and a shorter C1−H1 bond (1.12 Å). Characterization of TS (2′−3′).IMe2 showed it leads directly to product 3′.IMe2, where the IMe2H+ imidazolium cation (omitted in Figure 2) is loosely associated with the carbonyl oxygen (O···H2 = 1.97 Å).
Figure 2
Figure 2. Stationary points for C−H activation in 2′.IMe2 to give 3′.IMe2: (a) base-assisted process; (b) the oxidative addition intermediate 4′.IMe2. Selected distances (Å) and relative energies (kcal/mol) are indicated, with computed free energies in italics. PMe3 substituents and, in 3′.IMe2, the imidazolium ion are omitted for clarity.
In contrast, reaction profiles for the approach of the external IMe2 toward the agostic hydrogen (H1) did not lead to deprotonation. Instead IMe2 remains a spectator, and deliberate elongation of the C1−H1 bond only led to oxidative addition (ΔE‡ = +19.6 kcal/mol) without inducing any approach of the base. The resulting seven-coordinate Ru(IV) intermediate, 4′.IMe2 (E = +18.9 kcal/mol, Figure 2b) can then be deprotonated by IMe2 to generate 3′.IMe2, although this involves an even higher transition state at +22.5 kcal/mol (see SI).
The easier deprotonation of the C1−H2 bond that is geminal to agostic C1−H1 can be rationalized by computed natural atomic charges. For 2′ (i.e., in the absence of IMe2) the agostic proton, H1, in fact displays a much lower positive charge (+0.226) than either H2 (+0.295) or H3 (+0.268). This is accentuated in 2′.IMe2 (H1: +0.218; H2: +0.313; H3: +0.251). Thus in 2′ H2 is already the most acidic hydrogen, and this is only enhanced by the approach of a base. This pattern has in fact been noted before in a benzylic Rh pincer complex, where a higher positive charge for a hydrogen atom geminal to an agostic C−H bond was also computed. In that case, however, no reaction with external base was observed experimentally. (10)
Further calculations on 2′ showed that, unsurprisingly, a stronger external base (11) facilitates C−H activation (IMe4: ΔE‡ = 10.6 kcal/mol; IiPr2Me2: ΔE‡ = 9.2 kcal/mol). (5) Computation of the full experimental system (i.e., 2 plus IiPr2Me2) showed that including the full PPh3 ligands increased the barrier to 11.8 kcal/mol, presumably due to steric effects that impede approach of the base. (12) Despite this, the computed barrier for the full system is consistent with it being readily surmountable at room temperature. In contrast, weaker external bases entail much higher barriers (e.g., NMe3: ΔE‡ = +25.4 kcal/mol), while with H2O no equivalent C−H activation process could be defined.
In summary, we have demonstrated facile deprotonation of a nonagostic alkyl C−H bond to give a C−H activation product. Our results contrast with examples in the literature where base-assisted intramolecular electrophilic activation involves agostic C−H bonds. In many cases an internal base is employed (e.g., acetate) which is geometrically predisposed to target the agostic bond. (13) Assistance by external base has been modeled elsewhere, for example, in the intermolecular activation of CH4 in the Catalytica process. (14) In that case a σ-CH4 complex was formed and subsequent C−H activation was reported only for the bond directly interacting with the metal center. The present computational studies indicate that the base-induced cleavage of a nonagostic C−H bond is possible and indeed preferable to cleavage of an agostic C−H bond, despite the perception that the latter should be more acidic. This insight adds a further mode of C−H activation to what is already a mechanistically rich and diverse area.
