Abstract
Adsorptions of methane, ethane and pentane on the -alumina (110C) surface are investigated with semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. It
is found that the abstraction of an H atom accompanied by the formation of a C–O bond is the most favorable reaction for methane on the alumina
surface. For ethane– and pentane–alumina interactions, the abstraction of two H atoms accompanied by the formation of an alkene is the most
favorable reaction. The surface Al atoms help to promote the reactions, but are not directly involved in the bond formation.

1. Introduction
The interpretation of H/D exchange between surface OH-
groups of a metal oxide and CD4 as an indication of strong
Br¨
onsted acidity [1–4] was questioned by Engelhardt et al. [5,6],
who proposed an alternative explanation that H/D exchange
could be initiated by dissociative methane chemisorption over
Lewis acid–Lewis base pair sites. Such chemisorption would
produce the surface species CD3−and D+, with the CD3−
moiety bound to a valence unsaturated Al atom of Lewis acid
character.
The Lewis acidity of surface Al sites on -alumina has
been the subject of several previous investigations [7–9], as
has the reactivity of these sites with water [10–12], hydrogen
sulﬁde [10], carbon monoxide [10], ammonia [11], pyridine
[11], and methanol [13]. Previously we applied theoretical
calculations to gain insight into the interaction of 1-hexene
with -alumina, and found the interaction to be purely repul-
sive at valence unsaturated surface Al sites [14]. By contrast,
investigations of the interactions of simple alcohols with -

alumina showed participation of the surface Lewis acid sites
[15].
Herein we report the results of calculations designed to inves-
tigate the adsorption of methane, ethane and pentane on the -
alumina (110C) surface. Two cluster models, H8Al40O64 (which
exposes an Al–O terminated face on the hydrogen-spinel form of
-alumina) and Al48O72 (which exposes an oxygen terminated
face on the hydrogen-free defect-spinel form of -alumina),
were used to model the -alumina surface. By employing mod-
els with different degrees of hydrogenation we can explore
the temperature dependence of the reactivity of -alumina as
a heterogeneous catalyst. We found that on both models, the
most energetically favorable ﬁrst reaction step for methane is H
abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with C1 bonding to a
surface oxygen. (Note: atomic labels are C1–C2–C3–C4–C5 for
pentane, C1–C2 for ethane and C1 for methane. Hn refers to the
H atoms bonding to Cn.) For ethane and pentane, the most ener-
getically favorable ﬁrst reaction step is the dehydrogenation of
two H atoms from different carbon atoms. In pentane–alumina
interactions, the two H atoms are abstracted from C2 and
C3, respectively, producing 2-pentene. Under certain conditions
these reactions can be exothermic. The lowest energy barriers to
these reactions are around 60–70 kcal/mol on H8Al40O64 model
and around 26–37 kcal/mol on Al48O72 model.

2. Computational method and models
The adsorptions of methane, ethane and pentane on the
-alumina (110C) surface were investigated with electronic
structure calculations based on the semi-empirical PM3 Hamil-
tonian [16,17] and H8Al40O64 and Al48O72 cluster models of
-alumina (see Fig. 1). We chose the PM3 model Hamilto-
nian because it is parameterized for Al and because the much
lower computational cost of semi-empirical calculations allows
for modeling a cluster that includes all atoms up to and includ-
ing second-nearest-neighbors of the adsorption site, much larger
than is currently practical with ﬁrst-principles methods. The
large cluster size is important because second-nearest-neighbor
effects have been shown to heavily inﬂuence surface chem-
istry in cubic aluminas [18]. Semi-empirical models have been
used effectively in theoretical investigations of similar systems
[8,15,19,20] and have been shown to lead to qualitative con-
clusions and energetic behavior consistent with ﬁrst-principles
calculations.
-Alumina has been described as a defect-spinel structure
closely related to that of Mg-spinel (space group Fd¯
3m) [21]
but with the Al cations distributed over both the octahedral
(Oh, Al sites) and tetrahedral (Td, Mg sites) interstitial sites
within the oxygen anion sublattice. -Alumina has a range of
valid stoichiometries H3mAl2−mO3 (0 ≤m ≤(1/3)), but the low-
est energy form has the stoichiometry of a hydrogen–aluminum
spinel [22]. The primitive unit cell of the lowest energy form is
HAl5O8, where the H atom and one Al atom occupy (nominally)
the Mg sites in the spinel structure, and the remaining four Al
atoms occupy the Al sites in the spinel structure. Surface stud-
ies show that the (110C) layer of -alumina is preferentially
exposed [23–26]. The H8Al40O64 cluster model [14] (Model I,
Fig. 1(a)) was constructed based on structural relaxation studies
of a 56-atom slab of -alumina (HAl5O8 stoichiometry) four
atomic layers thick [18]. This is representative of -alumina
at low to moderate temperatures. The Al48O72 cluster model
(Model II, Fig. 1(b)) is constructed based on the Al48O64 super-
cell of hydrogen-free -alumina. The cation vacancies required
for valence balance were assigned to tetrahedral sites paral-
lel to the (110C) surface [15]. This model is representative of
the -alumina surface at high temperatures. These two models
ensure that the coordination environment of the surface atoms
interacting with the adsorbate, and their nearest-neighbors, are
representative of those on the surface of the periodic crystal.
For Model I, two different surface aluminum sites for alkane
adsorption were studied as indicated in Fig. 1(a). Only surface
Al atoms at Oh sites were considered since three-coordinated
Al practically does not exit on the surface [26–28]. At site A,
the surface Al atom interacting with the alkane has a neigh-
boring OH. (Denoted as AlsA. The subscript “s” indicates an
atom on the alumina surface.) At site B, there is no neighboring
OH around the Al atom that interacts with alkane (denoted as
AlsB). Interactions of an alkane with three different surface O
sites were considered as indicated in Fig. 1(a). At site A, the
surface O atom is coordinated by one H atom and two Al atoms
(denoted as OsA). At site B, the surface O atom is coordinated
by two Al atoms (denoted as OsB). At site C, the surface O
atom is coordinated by three Al atoms (denoted as OsC). As
previous density-functional calculations have shown no appre-
ciable relaxation effects or consequence for surface atoms, with
the exception of the three-coordinated Al atoms that are not
considered here [26], the alumina substrate was frozen in all
calculations with the exception of the H atom bound to the OsA
atom.
For Model II, the slab is free of H atoms so AlsA and AlsB
atoms are equivalent, as are OsA and OsB (see Fig. 1(b)). There-
fore, we only consider Als, OsA and OsC sites. The alumina
substrate was frozen in all calculations.
In structural optimizations, the adsorbed molecules were
fully relaxed, including their positions relative to the surface,
except in the case of energy barrier calculations where one of
the H1–Os distances was ﬁxed at different values from about 0.1
to 0.5 nm in steps of approximately 0.02 nm. For all chemisorbed
states, vibrational frequencies were calculated to ensure that
each state is a true local minimum.
To study molecule/surface interactions the free molecule was
placed in close proximity to the surface in various orientations
and for each orientation a geometry optimization was carried
out. We specify the interaction as A–Xs. This notation denotes
atom A of the free molecule in close proximity to atom Xs of
the surface slab. In some cases the initial orientation of the free
molecule involved two close contacts, denoted as A–Xs & B–Ys,
where atom A of the free molecule is in close proximity to atom
Xs of the surface slab and atom B of the free molecule is simul-
taneously in close proximity to atom Ys of the surface slab.
The following possible interaction modes were investigated: (1)

an H1 atom interacts with a surface Lewis base site (H1–Os);
(2) the C1 atom interacts with an Os site (C1–Os); (3) the C1
atom and an H1 atom interact with a same Os site (H1–Os &
C1–Os); (4) the C1 atom and an H1 atom interact with two
different Os sites (C1–Osi & H1–Osj); (5) the C1 atom inter-
acts with an Als site and an H1 atom interacts with an Os site
(C1–Als & H1–Os); (6) an H1 and an H2 atom interact with
two Os sites (H1–Osi & H2–Osj); (7) an H2 atom interacts with
an Os site (H2–Os); (8) an H3 atom interacts with an Os site
(H3–Os); (9) an H2 and an H3 atom interact with two differ-
ent Os sites (H2–Osi & H3–Osj). (Interaction mode 6 is only
available for ethane and pentane. Interaction modes 7, 8 and 9
are available only for pentane.) The superscripts i and j indicate
two different sites. The initial C1–Os and H–Os distances were
set to less than 0.15 and 0.1 nm, respectively to allow for strong
interaction.
3. Results
The calculated results are given in Table 1 .
3.1. Adsorption of methane, ethane and pentane on Model I
3.1.1. Interactions of H1 with a surface O atom
When the initial conﬁguration is such that one of the H1
atoms of methane, ethane or pentane is in close proximity to a
surface oxygen atom (with sufﬁciently short H–Os distances for
strong interactions), upon full relaxation the molecule simply
leaves the surface without any reaction.
3.1.2. Interactions of C1 with a surface O atom
Instead of an H1 atom as in Section 3.1.1, we placed the C1
atom close to a surface oxygen atom. Similarly, no reactions
happen upon full optimization.
3.1.3. Interactions of H1 and C1 with a surface O atom
Reactions were found to happen in the cases of H1–OsA
& C1–OsA and H1–OsB & C1–OsB. In both cases, upon full
optimization the H1–C1 bond is broken and both the H1 and
C1 atoms bond to the same Os atom. The length of the newly
formed H1–Os bond is about 0.1 nm, while the C1–Os bond
lengthis0.146–0.163 nm(seeTable1),indicatingachemisorbed
state. The energies of these ﬁnal chemisorbed states, how-
ever, are higher than that of the corresponding free state
[E(alkane) + E(H8Al40O64)], i.e. these reactions are endother-
mic. Note that for these reactions, the Hs that was originally
bonded to OsA moves to a nearby Os (if the OsA is involved
in reaction) due to strong repulsive interaction between Hs and
nearby C or H atoms in the initial state. As shown in Table 1,
this typically has the effect of signiﬁcantly decreasing E for
chemisorption.
To estimate the energy barriers for such reactions, we ﬁxed
the H1 atom at various positions relative to Os and relaxed
all other atoms of the molecule. The energy variation with
the H1–Os
distance can then be mapped out. Fig. 2
shows the energy variation with H1–Os distance for the H1–OsA
& C1–OsA interaction, where E = E(alkane/H8Al40O64)

−E(alkane) −E(H8Al40O64). The energy increases with the
decrease of H1–Os distance before reaction. For the H1–OsA
& C1–OsA interaction, the energy required for a free molecule
to come to a surface position close enough for the reac-
tion to happen is 94.2, 101.4 and 107.7 kcal/mol for methane,
ethane and pentane, respectively. This implies that there is
an energy barrier to overcome before the chemisorbed state,
where dehydrogenation occurs, is accessed. The interactions
at site OsB are similar to site OsA, but the dehydrogenated
state is even higher in energy. The energy decrease in
the ﬁnal state for the H1–OsA & C1–OsA interaction is
mainly due to the transfer of Hs on the OsA to another Os
atom.
3.1.4. Interactions of H1 and C1 with two different surface
O atoms
Methane, ethane and pentane can all react with surface oxy-
gen atoms by simultaneous interaction of H1 & C1 with two
different OsC atoms, but their ﬁnal states are different. For
methane, in addition to H1 dehydrogenation, the C1 atom bonds
to the nearby Os atom; while for ethane and pentane, the remnant
fragment leaves the surface after dehydrogenation. The newly
formed H–Os bond lengths are 0.097 nm, and the C1–Os bond
length is 0.14 nm. These reactions are endothermic. The reac-
tions of methane, ethane and pentane with OsA & OsB are all
similar to that of methane with OsC1 & OsC2 except that it is
exothermic due to the transfer of the Hs atom on the OsA to
another Os atom. (The superscripts C1 and C2 indicate two
different OC sites. The initial and ﬁnal state conﬁgurations
of the C1–OsA & H1–OsB interaction for methane are shown
in Fig. 3.)
Similar energy barrier calculations to those described in Sec-
tion 3.1.3 show that the energy required for the reactions of
methane and ethane on OsA & OsB to happen are lower than
that on OsC1 & OsC2, whereas that for pentane on OsA & OsB is
higher than that on OsC1 & OsC2.

3.1.5. Interactions of C1 with a surface Al and H1 with a
surface O atom
For initial conﬁgurations with C1 close to Als and H1 close to
Os, only the C1–AlsB & H1–OsB conﬁguration for methane and
ethane leads to reaction. This dehydrogenation is endothermic
and proceeds with an activation energy of 78.5 and 60.7 kcal/mol
for the two species, respectively. As we have shown in Sec-
tion 3.1.1, reactions between only H and Os do not happen.
Therefore, the interaction of C with Als promotes the H1 abstrac-
tion. When we moved the CH3 fragment to the surface so that
d(C1 −AlsB) = 0.14 nm, upon full structural optimization the
fragment leaves the surface again, indicating that the C1–Als
interaction is repulsive.
3.1.6. Interactions of H1 and H2 with two different surface
O atoms
Since methane contains no H2, this interaction mode only
exists for ethane and pentane. Reactions happen for the H1–OsB
& H2–OsA and H1–OsC1 & H2–OsC2 conﬁgurations. Both H1
and H2 are dehydrogenated, producing ethene or 1-pentene. The
newly formed H–Os bond lengths are about 0.097 nm. Sim-
ilar to the methane reaction with conﬁguration of C1–Os &
H1–Os (Section 3.1.4), the reaction is endothermic with two
OsC, and exothermic with OsA & OsB. The transfer of the Hs
atom makes the latter reaction more favorable than the former
one. The energy barrier to the latter reaction is also smaller than
the former one.

mic with two OsC, and exothermic with OsA & OsB due to the
transfer of the Hs atom. The energy barrier to the exothermic
reaction is slightly larger than that for the endothermic one.

3.2.1. Interactions of H1 with a surface O atom
The interactions of H1 with a surface oxygen atom (OsA or
OsC) were investigated. Reactions occur only for the H1–OsA
interaction. In this case, the H1 atom transfers to the surface to
form an H1–Os bond with bond length ca. 0.096 nm, while the
remnant fragment leaves the surface. The reactions are exother-
mic and the energy decrease is greatest for methane reaction. The
energy barriers to be overcome before the reaction can happen
are 34.3, 53.8 and 45.7 kcal/mol for methane, ethane and pen-
tane, respectively. Fig. 2 gives corresponding energy variation
curves with the H1–Os distance for methane and pentane.
3.2.2. Interactions of C1 with a surface O atom
Similar to Section 3.2.1, reactions are only found on the OsA
site. In addition to dehydrogenation, however, the remnant frag-
ment also binds to the OsA atom forming a C1–OsA bond. Note
that the abstracted H1 atom bonds to an OsA different from
the one C1 bonds to. The reactions show gradually decreasing
exothermicity from methane to pentane. By contrast, the energy
barrier increases from methane to pentane. The energy barriers
for these reactions are generally lower than those for the H1–OsA
reactions.
3.2.3. Interactions of H1 and C1 with a surface O atom
TheinteractionsofH1andC1withanOsA orOsC yielddiffer-
ent results. For the interactions with OsA, the H1 is abstracted
and bonds to an OsA atom, accompanied by the formation of
a C1–OsA bond. This is similar to the case of pure C1–OsA
interactions, including the ﬁnal state energies but the energy
barriers are higher for this reaction mode. For the interactions
with OsC, however, only the H1 is transferred to the OsC, result-
ing in much higher energies in the ﬁnal states than in the former

case. These reactions are endothermic and the energy barriers
are high, especially for pentane.
3.2.4. Interactions of H1 and C1 with two different surface
O atoms
Similar to the interactions of H1 and C1 with a surface O
atom (Section 3.2.3), the reactions on OsA sites result in dehy-
drogenation and formation of C1–OsA bond, while the reactions
on OsC sites only result in dehydrogenation. The former reac-
tions yield much more stable ﬁnal state and require much lower
activation energies.
3.2.5. Interactions of C1 with a surface Al and H1 with a
surface O atom
TherearetwointeractionmodesofthetypeC1–Als &H1–Os.
In the ﬁrst mode, one H1 and C1 are close to an Als and two H1
are close to an Os (denoted as ‘a’ in column 1 of Table 1). In the
second mode, two H1 and C1 are close to an Als and one H1 is
close to an Os (denoted as ‘b’ in column 1 of Table 1). Modes
a and b are depicted in Fig. 4. For the interactions with Als &
OsA, both modes a and b result in exothermic reactions, but the
ﬁnal products and ﬁnal state energies are different. For mode b,
the fragments resulting after dehydrogenation leave the surface,
whereas they bond to OsA atoms in mode a. The ﬁnal states
of mode a reactions are more stable than those of the mode b
reactions. Note that although for mode a, the H1–OsA1 distance
is smaller than the H1–OsA2 distance in the initial conﬁgura-
tion, the bond formed in the ﬁnal product is H1–OsA2. For the
interactions with Als & OsC in mode a, an H1 atom moves to a
boundary Os atom after structural relaxation. Since the bound-
ary atoms are not described precisely in our model, this reaction
is probably unphysical and is neglected in our discussion. In
mode b, the reactions are endothermic and have larger barriers
than the reactions on Als & OsA sites.
3.2.6. Interactions of H1 and H2 with different surface O
atoms
The interactions of H1 and H2 with two Os atoms were
investigated. It was found that such interactions result in dehy-
drogenation of both the H1 and H2 atoms, with the product
alkene leaving the surface. The new H–Os bond lengths are
about 0.1 nm. The energy of the ﬁnal state for the reaction at
sites OsA is lower than that of the corresponding free state
[E(alkane) + E(Al48O72)], by about −115 kcal/mol for both

ethane and pentane, whereas at sites OsC the ﬁnal state energy
is higher by 36.3 and 28.9 kcal/mol in the ethane and pentane
cases, respectively. Fixing the H1 atom at various positions and
relaxing all other atoms of the molecule, the energy barriers for
such a reaction to happen were calculated to be much lower for
the production of the alkene at the OsA site than at the OsC site.
3.2.7. Interactions of H2 with a surface O atom
The interactions of H2 with a surface oxygen atom (OsA or
OsC) were investigated and found to produce a reaction only in
the H2–OsA case. In this case, the reaction is slightly exothermic
and a H2–OsA bond forms.
3.2.8. Interactions of H3 with a surface O atom
The interactions of H3 with a surface oxygen atom (OsA or
OsC) are very similar to those of H2, except that the reactive case
(H3–OsA) is much more exothermic than the H2–OsA case.
3.2.9. Interactions of H2 and H3 with different surface O
atoms
The interaction of H2 and H3 with OsA1 and OsA2, respec-
tively, produces very similar results to those of H1 and H2
interacting with different OsA atoms. Such interaction results
in dehydrogenation of both the H2 and H3 atoms, with the prod-
uct 2-pentene leaving the surface. This is the most exothermic
reaction for pentane overall, and has an energy barrier of only
39 kcal/mol. (This reaction mode is only possible for pentane,
since only pentane has H3 atoms.) The interaction of H2 and H3
with OsC1 and OsC2, respectively, produces only the formation
of an H2–OsC1 bond.
3.3. Surface O atoms
To further analyze the reactivity of surface Lewis base sites
(Os) we have computed Mopac charges, which are collected in
Table 2. Note that OsA sites generally are less electron-rich than
OsB and OsC sites.
4. Discussion
The low energy reaction modes are summarized in Table 3,
where they are grouped by adsorbate and surface model, and
ranked by decreasing exothermicity. It can be seen that on Model
I, interactions of methane with the -alumina surface result in
two types of reactions: abstraction of one H1 atom (type 1), and
abstraction of one H1 atom accompanied by the formation of
a C1–O bond (type 2). Only one reaction belonging to type 2
(C1–OsA & H1–OsB) is exothermic, and it also happens to have
lowest energy barrier.
In the case of ethane interactions with the -alumina surface,
three types of reactions are found. The lowest energy reaction is
the dehydrogenation of H1 and H2 atoms, yielding ethene (type
3). The next most favorable reaction is the abstraction of one H1
atom accompanied by the formation of a C1–O bond (type 2),
with type 1 reactions being the least favorable.
In the case of pentene interactions with the -alumina surface,
four types of reactions are found. The lowest energy reaction is
the dehydrogenation of H2 and H3 atoms, yielding 2-pentene
(type 4). The next most favorable reaction is the dehydrogena-
tion of H1 and H2 atoms, yielding 1-pentene (type 3). The least
exothermic reaction is the abstraction of one H1 atom accompa-
nied by the formation of a C1–O bond (type 2). Reaction type 1
is endothermic.
On Model II, type 2 reactions are more favorable than type 1
for methane, as is the case on Model I. Similarly, type 3 reaction
is the most favorable and type 1 is the least favorable for ethane.
For pentane, there are two new reaction types: abstraction of
one H3 or one H2 atom. Among all six reaction types, reaction
type 4 is the most favorable. As on model I, for interactions of
pentane with Model II, reactions of type 2 are more favorable
than those of type 1. Almost all reactions happen on site OsA,
indicating the relative inertness of site OsC.
Since the hydrogenated model (Model I) is probably more
representative of low-temperature catalyst operation and the
hydrogen-free model (Model II) is probably more representa-
tive of high-temperature catalyst operation, it can be concluded
that independent of temperature, the interaction of methane with
the -alumina surface results in the abstraction of one H atom
accompanied by the formation of a C–O bond. For the other alka-
nes, however, the main reactions are the formation of an alkene
by the dehydrogenation of two H atoms. On both models, sites
OsA and OsB are generally more reactive than site OsC.
In the case of pentane, the calculations ﬁnd production of
2-pentene to slightly more exothermic that production of 1-
pentene. This is consistent with the fact that the terminal alkene
is the thermodynamically less stable of the two isomers as
is shown by the experimental observation that hydrogenation
of 1-pentene is exothermic by 30.1 kcal/mol, hydrogenation
of trans-2-pentene is exothermic by 27.6 kcal/mol, and hydro-
genation of cis-2-pentene is exothermic by 28.6 kcal/mol [29].
The computed energy barriers, however, suggest that produc-
tion of the terminal alkene is kinetically favored. While the
small difference between the barriers to production of 1-pentene
and 2-pentene is less than the degree of uncertainty from the
PM3 methodology, there is some experimental evidence that
supports this prediction. According to Ref. [30] reaction of
pentane on a Cr–K-doped alumina catalyst at 527 K produced
9.7% 1-pentene and 90.3% is 2-pentene. Based on the rel-
ative energies of the pentene isomers determined from the
hydrogenation reactions cited above, an equilibrium Boltz-
mann distribution at 527 K will contain only 6.2% 1-pentene
and 93.8% 2-pentene. The reaction is actually producing more
1-pentene than is predicted based strictly on equilibrium ther-
modynamic considerations. This suggests that there is in fact
a slight kinetic preference for production of 1-pentene over 2-
pentene. (One caveat to this analysis is that the experimental

results are not for a pure alumina catalyst, as are our calcula-
tions.)
Our results suggest that H/D exchange is most probably ini-
tiated by dissociative methane chemisorption over Lewis base
sites. Although Lewis acid sites may be involved in promoting
the dissociation, the CD3 moiety is bound to an O atom of Lewis
base character, not to surface aluminum as has been proposed
previously [5,6].
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have employed semi-empirical (PM3) clus-
ter calculations to investigate the adsorptions of methane, ethane
and pentane on the -alumina (110C) surface. The results show
that regardless of the hydrogenation of the alumina, all three
alkanes can be dehydrogenated when they come sufﬁciently
close to the surface. The main product of methane–alumina reac-

tions leaves the CH3 moiety bound to a surface O atom that is
coordinated by two Al atoms (OsA or OsB). By contrast, the main
products for ethane– and pentane–alumina interactions are the
corresponding alkenes.
