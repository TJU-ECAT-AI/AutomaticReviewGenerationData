Abstract
A combined use of DFT periodic calculations and spectroscopic studies (IR and solid-state NMR) shows that a γ-alumina treated at 500 °C under high vacuum contains surface defects, which are very reactive toward H2 or CH4. The reaction of H2 on defect sites occurs at low temperature (ca. 25 °C) on two types of Al atoms of low coordination numbers, AlIII or AlIV, to give AlIV−H and AlV−H, respectively. The amount of defects as titrated by H2 at 25 and 150 °C is 0.043 and 0.069 site/nm2, respectively, in comparison with 4 OH/nm2). In contrast, CH4 reacts selectively at 100−150 °C on the most reactive AlIII sites to form the corresponding AlIV−CH3 (0.030 site/nm2). The difference of reactivity of H2 and CH4 is fully consistent with calculations (reaction and activitation energy, ΔE and ΔE⧧).

Introduction
γ-Alumina (γ-Al2O3) is used ubiquitously in industry or academia as a catalyst or a catalyst support. Nonetheless, a molecular understanding of its surface reactivity is still a challenge. 1 As hydration is of particular interest for tuning the surface reactivity, several attempts to rationalize this complex phenomenon can be found. Assignments in the region of the O−H stretching frequencies have been proposed for infrared spectroscopy, 2 and the O−H coverage has been evaluated by chemical reactions with Grignard reagents or by 1H NMR. 3 The theoretical investigation of the surface structure proposed by Digne et al. on the basis of DFT calculations has refined the previous assignment of O−H stretching frequencies and has given a one-to-one relation between the structure of the surface (i.e., the water coverage) and the temperature of pretreatment of γ-alumina. 4 Further calculations showed that the reactions between the surface and a water molecule are nonactivated processes and hence that the thermodynamical one-to-one relation is not modified by kinetic factors. 5 However, on the basis of fluorescence spectroscopy, surface hydration is found to be inhomogeneous:  some regions are hydrated while others remain free of any hydroxyl group. 6 Surface reactivity is a crucial step for catalytic applications of γ-Al2O3. Activation of H−H and C−H bonds are among the most revealing cases. Heterolytic dissociations of H−H and C−H bonds have been suggested in the mechanism of isotopic exchange between CH4 and CD4. 7 This reaction was proposed to take place on tricoordinated Al atoms and a tentative assignment for Al−H and O−D groups was proposed from IR study (vide infra for further discussions). 8 If the activation of H2 happens at low temperature, that of CH4 requires a higher temperature (420 K). 7-9 The process was found to be catalyzed by a small number of active sites.8 Theoretical investigations of the reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated Al atoms have only been conducted with small Al clusters (1 or 2 Al atoms). They show that Al−O bonds can react with H2 but give a high barrier for propane (132 kJ·mol-1). 10 The reactivity of alkanes is hence not well-understood. Therefore, we propose a combined experiment−theory approach to better understand the reactivity of the alumina surfaces toward these important chemical probes (H2 and CH4). The periodic model of γ-Al2O3 introduced by Digne et al. has been used and further developed for a realistic extended description of the surface. Furthermore, the structure and concentration of active defect sites can be evaluated by combining reactivity, spectroscopy, and modeling.
Experimental Section
General Procedure. Methane and hydrogen were purified on R-3/11 from BASF and MS 4 Å prior to use. Gas-phase analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a KCl/Al2O3 on a fused silica column (50 m × 0.32 mm). Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 550-FT by using an infrared cell equipped with CaF2 windows, allowing in situ studies. Typically, 16 scans were accumulated for each spectrum (resolution, 2 cm-1). All solid-state NMR spectra were recorded under MAS (νR = 10 kHz) on a Brüker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a standard 4-mm double-bearing probe head and operating at 125.73 MHz for 13C. The freshly prepared samples were immediately introduced in the 4 mm zirconia rotor in a glovebox and tightly closed. Compressed air was used for both bearing and driving the rotors. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield from SiMe4 (±0.1 and 1 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively).
Preparation of γ-Alumina. γ-Al2O3 from Degussa was calcined at 500 °C in dry air for 18 h and then treated at 500 °C under vacuum (0.13 mPa) for 18 h to give γ-Al2O3-(500) (105 m2/g).
Reaction of γ-Alumina with H2. Monitoring by IR Spectroscopy. A γ-Al2O3-(500) disk (40 mg) was contacted with hydrogen (5.8 × 10-3 mol, 53 kPa) at 25, 100, and 150 °C for 1 h. At each temperature, an IR spectrum was recorded. At the last step H2 was evacuated for 1 h at 25 °C prior to recording an IR spectrum.
Reaction of γ-Alumina with H2 and Titration of Al−H Sites. γ-Al2O3-(500) (100 mg) was treated with H2 (4.6 × 10-4 mol, 53 kPa) at 25 °C for 2 h. This sample was then treated with an excess of H2O for 48 h at 25 °C, and 0.77 × 10-5 mol of H2/g of solid is formed.

Reaction of γ-Alumina with CH4. Monitoring by IR Spectroscopy. A γ-Al2O3-(500) disk (40 mg) was contacted with methane (5.8 × 10-3 mol, 53 kPa) at 25, 100, and 150 °C for 1 h. At each temperature, an IR spectrum was recorded after trapping methane in liquid nitrogen. At the last step methane was evacuated for 1 h at 25 °C prior to recording an IR spectrum.
Reaction of γ-Alumina with CH4. Titration of Al−Me Sites. γ-Al2O3-(500) (100 mg) was treated with CH4 (4.6 × 10-4 mol, 53 kPa) at 150 °C for 15 h, and the solid was treated under vacuum for 1 h. 13C CP/MAS solid-state NMR:  −22.0 ppm. This solid (100 mg) was treated with an excess of H2O at 25 °C for 48 h, and it liberates 0.56 × 10-5 mol of CH4/g of solid.
Computational Methods. The calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using a periodic description of the system as implemented in the VASP code. 11 The generalized gradient approximation was used in the formulation of Perdew and Wang PW91. 12 Atomic cores are described with the projected augmented wave method 13 (PAW) which is equivalent to an all electrons frozen core approach. The wave functions are developed on a basis set of plane waves. With the selected PAW potentials, a cutoff energy of 275 eV is adequate and yields a converged total energy. Brillouin zone integration is converged with a 331 k-point mesh generated by the Monkhorst-Pack algorithm. 14 Minimum energy pathways have been found using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method with eight equally spaced images along the pathway. 15 Vibrational frequencies are calculated in the harmonic approximation by a numerical evaluation of the Hessian matrix. Chemical shifts have been evaluated on selected cluster models (see ref 16 for more details) with the GIAO method17 implemented in the Gaussian03 code18 at the DFT/B3LYP level. 19-22 The IGLO-II basis set 23 has been used for carbon and hydrogen. For other atoms, Hay and Wadt effective core potential 24-26 have been used with the adapted LANL2DZ basis set.
The surface has been modeled by a periodic slab and the various envisaged adsorptions have been performed on only one face of the slab, generating an asymmetric surface representation. The thickness of the model slab has been sampled from 8 to 4 atomic layers with no significant changes. Thus, a 4 layer slab has been used as a standard model. With such an asymmetric representation of the surface, some dipole correction may be necessary. Tests reveal only infinitesimal changes in geometries and the energetic corrections are below 5 kJ·mol-1, which is coherent with the large vacuum zone between the slabs (≈17 Å). Thus, such corrections have not been applied.
Results and Discussion
1. Probing Inhomogeneity through Reactivity Studies. 1.1. Reactivity of H2with γ-Alumina. The reaction of γ-alumina partially dehydroxylated at 500 °C, γ-Al2O3-(500), with H2 was monitored by IR spectroscopy. Upon contact of γ-Al2O3-(500) with H2 (53 kPa) at 25 °C for 1 h, two groups of bands in the 1850−1950 and 3500−3800 cm-1 regions appear (Figure 1a,b and Figure S1 (Supporting Information) for additional details). More specifically, the bands at 1902 and 1866 cm-1 are consistent with the formation of Als−H species, 27 while those in the 3800−3660 cm-1 region reflect the formation of Als−OH species. Only a slight evolution of the spectrum is observed even after heating the sample at 100 or 150 °C for 1 h under H2. Moreover, after treatment under vacuum at 25 °C for 1 h, the IR spectrum is unchanged, which shows that it is an irreversible reaction. Furthermore, after treatment of γ-Al2O3-(500) with H2 at 150 °C for 2 h, hydrolysis gives 1.24 × 10-5 mol of H2/g of solid, which results from the reaction of H2O with Al−H species. For a γ-Al2O3-(500) having a specific surface area of 105 m2/g, the amount of Al−H and thereby of reactive sites (defects) per nm2 is about 0.069 ± 0.003. Note that when the treatment of γ-Al2O3-(500) with H2 is performed at 25 °C for 2 h, the amount of titrated defect sites is less, about 0.043 ± 0.002 per nm2, which shows a difference of reactivity between defect sites as already evidenced by IR spectroscopy.
1.2. Reactivity of CH4 with γ-Alumina. Experimentally, and in contrast to H2, no reaction is observed when γ-Al2O3-(500) is contacted with CH4 at 25 °C even after 1 h as evidenced by IR spectroscopy (spectra (ii-i) in Figure 1c,d, see Figure S2 (Supporting Information) for more details). However, at 100 °C, vibrations at 2941 and 2898 cm-1 appear, in agreement with the formation of surface methyl species (note that the signal at 3014 cm-1 corresponds to CH4 in the gas phase). This phenomenon is also accompanied by the appearance of AlsOH, albeit of weak intensities. Further heating at higher temperatures under CH4, i.e., 150 °C, does not significantly change the IR spectrum. Finally, treatment with H2O of γ-Al2O3-(500), previously treated with CH4 at 150 °C for 15 h, liberates 5.26 × 10-6 mol of CH4/g of solid and is evidence for the formation of Als−CH3 surface species upon reaction of CH4 with γ-Al2O3-(500). For γ-Al2O3-(500) having a specific surface area of 105 m2/g, there is about 0.030 ± 0.003 Als−CH3/nm2 in agreement with previous work.8 This is about 2 times less sites as obtained from the reaction of H2 with Al2O3-(500), but it is consistent with the lower reactivity of methane, which probably reacts selectively on certain specific defect sites. In fact, a single peak at −22.0 ppm, consistent with Als−CH3 (vide infra for further comments), appears in the 13C MAS solid-state NMR spectrum of a γ-Al2O3-(500) previously treated with 13CH4 (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).
2. Understanding the Reactivity through a Combined Use of Experimental and Theoretical Data. 2.1. Understanding of the Surface State of Alumina through a Thermodynamic Description of the Surface. Due to the topotactic transformation of boehmite, the (110) facet is the predominant one on γ-Al2O3 crystallites. 28 Thus, we focused on the model of this facet in the present study. The surface is thus described by a periodic model with a 8.4 × 8.1 Å2 unit cell. The hydration processes modeled by successive adsorption of water molecule (from 1 to 6 per unit cell) generate various types of hydroxyl groups. The most stable structure after adsorption of i water molecules per unit cell is noted si. From a thermodynamic approach, this model shows how the surface and hydration state of γ-Al2O3 depend on its pretreatment temperature. On the basis of IR data, γ-Al2O3-(500) (pretreated at 500 °C) is best described by a trihydrated unit cell s3 which correctly represents the diversity of the hydroxyl IR stretching frequencies. Nonetheless, a homogeneous s3 system overestimates the hydroxyl coverage (7.3 OH/nm2 vs 4 OH/nm2 as determined experimentally) and does not account for defect sites. A first approach to simulate the inhomogeneity of the hydration is to consider how the configurational entropy can affect the thermodynamics of the process. For this purpose, we have considered that water molecules on elementary cells of the periodic model have only small interactions with water molecules of neighboring cells. Thus, our system can be described as an ensemble of N independent unit cells, presenting various degrees of hydration (from 0 to 6 water molecules per unit cell, see Figure 2). The mean number ni of unit cells of type si on the surface in the system of N unit cells is given by the following equation,
where μ is the chemical potential of the gas phase, εi is the energy released by the adsorption of i water molecules (εi > 0), and ζ is the partition function of the open system {unit cell + adsorbed water molecule}. μ is linked to the water partial pressure P by the equation below, where Zint is the internal partition function of a water molecule:
Figure 2 Structure of the si unit cells, each having i water molecules (dissociated or not) linked to aluminum atoms of the surface. For a more complete description of these surfaces, see ref 4.
This model, which uses parameters from periodic first-principles calculations, allows us to tackle the periodicity problem and generates inhomogeneity from the periodic calculation:  the ni are represented as a function of temperature in Figure 3.
Figure 3 Mean number of si surfaces in a macroscopic system as a function of temperature for ultrahigh vacuum (P = 10-5 Torr).
On the different temperature zones, si and si+1 cell types can coexist, but there is no temperature zone where a si cell type coexists significantly with a si+2 cell type:  inhomogeneity exists, but this model does not allow the coexistence of highly hydrated zones and nonhydrated zones on the surface. However, it can be noticed that the water partial pressure has an important effect on the distribution of surface type. Digne et al.,4 who worked with standard pressure instead of high vacuum, showed that s3 is the major surface type present for T = 770 K while for the same temperature and P = 10-5 Torr, which are more representative of experimental conditions, we found that the major surface types are s1 and s0. If some different water pressures exist in the solid, which is a classical situation in porous solids due to local curvature of pores, 29 the coexistence of s3 and s0 is possible with a highly dehydroxylated surface on the external parts of the alumina particles and partially hydrated surfaces in the pores. This hypothesis is in agreement with the low surface concentration of defects since the major part of the area is formed by the pores rather than by the external part of the alumina particles. Furthermore, this shows that the control of the water partial pressure should be of interest in the pretreatment of the surface.
While the periodic model cannot fully explain the surface inhomogeneity, we have nonetheless explored the reactivity of the surface of s3 and s0 unit cells toward H2 and CH4 and compared these theoretical results with experimental data obtained by reacting H2 and CH4 on a γ-Al2O3 pretreated at 500 °C, γ-Al2O3-(500). The observed hydroxyl coverage can be reproduced by a complex description of the surface which combines the juxtaposition of s3, s2, s1, and s0. The reactivity study has focused on s3 and s0 because (1) all hydroxyl groups of s1 and s2 are present on s3 and (2) the Lewis acid sites of s1 also exist on s0.
2.2. Reactivity of the Alumina Surface and Understanding of the Structure of Its Defect Sites. Reactivity of theTrihydrated Al2O3 Surface s3 with H2. First, the nondissociative adsorption of H2 on a coordination vacancy of a pentacoordinated aluminum atom (AlV) is exo-energetic by 12 kJ·mol-1. The distance between H2 and the surface is 2.5 Å and the H−H distance is not affected compared to H2 in the gas phase, in agreement with a physisorption of H2. Moreover, the dissociation of H2 on this aluminum atom (see Figure 4a) is endoenergetic (ΔE = 47 kJ·mol-1), taking the H2 gas phase as a reference. Similarly, dissociation on the tetrahedral aluminum (see Figure 4b) is highly endoenergetic (ΔE = 127 kJ·mol-1).
Figure 4 Products of dissociation of H2 on the s3 surface (the arrows signal the H atoms that come from dihydrogen). (a) Dissociation on a pentacoordinated Al. (b) Dissociation on a tetracoordinated Al.
Second, the H2/H2O exchange (eq 1) on the tetrahedral Al of the s3 surface is also endoenergetic:  ΔE = 145 kJ·mol-1 (see Figure 5a, where the water molecule released in the gas phase is not represented). Although this exchange conserving a coordinated water molecule starting from the HO-μ2-(AlV,AlV) is less endoenergetic (see Figure 5b where the coordinated water molecule is circled), it is still highly unfavored by 79 kJ·mol-1.
Figure 5 H2O/H2 exchange on the s3 surface:  (a) on AlIV; (b) on AlV.
Thus, while the dissociative adsorption of H2 on γ-Al2O3-(500) has been experimentally observed (vide supra), the s3 surface is not reactive toward H2. Therefore, the reactivity of the s0 surface has been pursued.
Reactivity of the Fully Dehydrated Al2O3 Surface s0 with H2. In contrast, the dissociative adsorption of H2 on the most unsaturated site of s0 (AlIII) is highly exoenergetic, i.e., ΔE = −163 kJ·mol-1, giving an aluminum hydride (dAl-H = 1.58 Å, Figures 6 and 7d). A precursor state has been identified in which the Al−H2 distance is 2.1 Å and the H−H distance is enlarged by 3% compared to H2(g). This precursor state is stabilized by 70 kJ·mol-1 compared to H2 in the gas phase. This important stabilization reflects the high Lewis acidity of tricoordinated Al. The dissociation process starting from the precursor state has an activation barrier of 52 kJ·mol-1, which shows that the dissociation of H2 is possible when a sufficiently reactive site is present on the surface (such a site being absent on s3). The transition state is stabilized by a polarization of the H2 molecule, leading to the heterolytic splitting. The structures and the reaction pathway of the overall process are presented in Figure 6. This shows that the heterosplitting of H2 should take place readily at 25 °C. On less unsaturated aluminum atoms, namely, AlIV, the dissociation is also possible, but is less exoenergetic (−63 and −53 kJ·mol-1, Figures 7e and 7f, respectively, vide infra for further comment).

Figure 7 Structures of the aluminum sites of s0 (a, b, c) and the corresponding different stable aluminum hydrides (d, e, f) and methyl-aluminum (g, h, i) from dissociation of H2 and CH4 on s0, respectively. (d) νAl-H = 1920 cm-1 and ΔE = −163 kJ·mol-1; (e) νAl-H = 1833 cm-1 and ΔE = −63 kJ·mol-1; (f) νAl-H = 1910 cm-1 and ΔE = −53 kJ·mol-1; (g) ΔE = −138 kJ·mol-1; (h) ΔE = −47 kJ·mol-1; (i) ΔE = −25 kJ·mol-1.
To understand the structure of these hydrides, we have also calculated the stretching frequencies of the different aluminum hydrides, and this shows that they vary significantly depending on the Al center geometry and coordination (Figure 7). The hydride resulting from reaction of H2 on AlIII (Figure 7d), AlIV−H, is very stable compared to the others and is associated with the highest stretching frequency (1920 cm-1). Noteworthy, the hydride resulting from the reaction of H2 with the AlIV of Figure 7f also gives a high stretching frequency, i.e., νAl-H = 1910 cm-1, probably because it remains a tetracoordinated Al. Indeed, the large trans effect of the hydride ligand enlarges the Al−O distance from 1.83 to 2.62 Å, the oxygen being transferred to the neighboring AlIII center with a Al−O distance of 1.92 Å:  the hypothetical (AlV,AlIII) pair is hence transformed in a (AlIV,AlIV) unit. Nonetheless, the hydride of Figure 7f is not very stable due to the high distortion of the surface. Finally, the reaction of H2 on the other type of AlIV (Figure 7e) gives a hydride on a pentacoordinated Al atom, whose stretching frequency is much lower (1833 cm-1) than for those obtained for the other structures. Experimentally, we observe two frequencies, 1902 and 1866 cm-1, and this is consistent with the formation of several types of Als−H bonds. While it is not possible to evaluate experimentally the proportion of each hydride, it is clear that H2 reacts on AlIII and AlIV centers. These results partly differ from those of Lukinskas et al.,10 who found a reactivity of tetrahedral aluminum atoms in cluster models that cannot be reproduced in the environment of the solid. In fact, we show that hydration affects dramatically the surface geometry, and therefore the dissociative adsorption of H2 on partially frozen clusters is probably not a realistic model.
Reactivity of CH4 with s3 and s0Surfaces, Surface Species, and Comparison with the Reaction of H2. As already noticed for H2, the dissociative adsorption of CH4 on AlV atom of the s3 surface is endoenergetic (ΔE = 82 kJ·mol-1). Therefore, this surface is also unreactive toward methane. On the s0 surface, the dissociative adsorption of CH4 on AlIII is exoenergetic and weakly activated:  ΔE = −138 kJ·mol-1 and ΔE⧧ = 22 kJ·mol-1 (Figure 6b). No precursor state has been located for methane, but it is possible that it corresponds in fact to physisorbed methane, 30 which cannot be correctly described from DFT. The dissociation on less unsaturated aluminum atoms is also exoenergetic, ΔE = −25 kJ·mol-1 and −47 kJ·mol-1 on the different sites (see Figure 7g−i) as obtained for H2, but in contrast to H2, the reaction of CH4 with both types of AlIV gives pentacoordinated Al species. The surface rearrangement (obtained for H2) is less important in the latter case because the trans effect of CH3 is smaller than that of H. In fact, the Al−O bond trans to CH3 is enlarged only by 19% compared to 47% for H (Figure 7c, 7f, and 7i). Thus, the migration of the oxygen atom toward the AlIII center is not fully achieved and the resulting bond is 2.0 Å (vs 1.92 Å in the case of H2 dissociation), resulting in a smaller stabilization of the AlIII. It should be underlined that the exoenergetic C−H bond activation of methane with Al atoms as found in this study is in sharp contrast with what has been obtained on small clusters, 31 which predicted an endoenergetic dissociative adsorption of C−H bond of propane on tricoordinated aluminum atoms (132 kJ·mol-1).
The infrared spectroscopy being not really adapted to see Al−C bonds since they appear in the Al−O region, NMR chemical shift calculations have been performed on the products of CH4 dissociation and compared with the experimental result (a single peak at −22.0 ppm). Test calculations have been performed on known small molecules (Table S1, Supporting Information) and they show good agreement between model and experiment even if a small difference exists for a nonclassical structure like bridging ligand μ-CH3. The calculated chemical shifts depend on the Al coordination number, and AlIV−CH3 and AlV−CH3 are predicted at −15 and −1 ppm, respectively. Comparing these results with experimental data implies that only AlIV−CH3 sites have been formed. This is in contrast to the reaction of H2 with γ-Al2O3, which gives different types of Als−H surface species. Nonetheless, it is consistent with a reaction of methane on one specific defect site, probably the most reactive Lewis acid site, AlIII, to selectively give the AlIV−CH3 species. This in turn also explains the smaller amount of Als−CH3 species (0.030 ±0.003/nm2) compared to Als−H species (0.069 ± 0.003/nm2) found experimentally. Additionally, the dissociation of CH4 on the AlIII site of γ-Al2O3 requires going through a transition state which is higher in energy than the separated reactants {CH4(g), s0}, while the transition state for the dissociation of H2 is lower in energy than {H2(g), s0}. Thus, it is fully consistent with experimental data: H2 dissociation takes place at 25 °C, while the dissociation of CH4 requires higher temperatures (≥100 °C).
Conclusion
The average surface structure of γ-Al2O3 corresponding to partial hydration (∼4 OH/nm2) is well-described by the s3 model as seen from vibrational spectroscopy. However, the specific reactivity of H2 and CH4, followed by IR and NMR and modeled by DFT calculations, unambiguously shows that low coordination Al defects are present on γ-alumina treated at 500 °C. The reaction of H2 on defect sites occurs at low temperature (ca. 25 °C) on several types of Al atoms of low coordination numbers, AlIII or AlIV, to give AlIV−H and AlV−H, respectively, which amount to about 0.069 site/nm2 (in comparison with 4 OH/nm2). In contrast, CH4 reacts selectively at 100−150 °C on the more reactive AlIII sites to form the corresponding AlIV−CH3 (0.030 site/nm2). The difference of reactivity of H2 and CH4 is fully consistent with calculations (reaction and activitation energy, ΔE and ΔE⧧). Moreover, comparing experimental and calculated spectroscopic data allows the identification of the coordination of Al in Als−H (s = III or IV) and AlIV−CH3. This shows that defect sites of γ-Al2O3 are of several types (AlIII and AlIV), the former being much more reactive than the latter.
The thermodynamic model shows that the stable hydration structure of the surface strongly depends on the water partial pressure, and on the type of alumina surface. With treatment at 500 °C under low pressure (10-5 Torr), the model predicts a majority of s1 termination with a small fraction of s0 for a flat (110) surface. However, γ-Al2O3 is a porous solid and the effective water pressure is likely to vary in the solid due to local curvature of the pores, which can give locally a s3 termination. This porous structure, resulting in local pressure effects, combined with the not fully crystalline structure of γ-Al2O3 could be the origin of the strong inhomogeneity in surface hydroxylation. The average situation could correspond to a significant OH group density with the presence, in specific area such as the external surface of the solid, of highly reactive dehydrated tricoordinated or tetracoordinated Al atoms.
