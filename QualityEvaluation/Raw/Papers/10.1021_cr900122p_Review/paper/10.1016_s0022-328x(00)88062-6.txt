summary 
The reaction of TaCp,(L)Me (L = PMe, or PMe,Ph) wjth’R,P=CHR’ 
(R = 
Me, Et, or Ph; R’ = H, Me, or Ph) gives L, R,P, and TaCp,(CHR’)Me 
in good 
yield. The ethylidene complex has properties much like other alkylidene com- 
plexes in this class, but most importantly, it does not rearrange to the known 
TaCp,(C,H,)Me 
complex under conditions where the latter is stable. Instead, it 
rearranges 
to TaCp,(propylene)H, 
possibly by migration of the alkyl to the 
alkylidene ligand followed by F-hydride elimination. 
Introduction 
The alkylidene ligand in Nb and Ta complexes such as MCp,(CHR)X 
(R = H, 
Ph, or CMe3, X = alkyl or chloride) [ 
2,3], M(CH,CMe,),(CHCMele,) [4], or MCp- 
(CHCMe,)Cl, 
(M = Nb or Ta) [1,5] appear to be nucleophilic or “ylide-like”. 
Therefore it would seem possible to transfer an alkylidene moiety from a main 
group ylide to niobium(II1) or tantalum(II1) under the proper circumstances. 
One could thereby hope to prepare alkylidene complexes not available by the 
a-abstraction route [ 
1,4]. Furthermore, if the resulting complex reacts 
uniquely with (for example) an olefin, and the main group ylide does not, then 
a catalytic cycle could result ‘. 
During the study of TaCp,(CH,)(CH,) 
[ 
2] we discovered the phosphine com- 
plexes, TaCp,(L)Me (L = PMe3 or PMezPh), and saw evidence that phosphine 
liganh was lost readily. Substituting L with =CHR would regenerate the com-

? A rare example 
of this type of reaction 
is the copper(I) 
catalyzed 
cyclopropanation 
of olefins by 
sulfur ylides C&x]. Other alkylidene sources such as diazoalkanes have been used in this manner for 
some time. most spectacularly to synthesize asymmetric cyclopropanes of high optical puri,ty [6bl.

plex from which they were made (if R = H) or more stable relatives (if R = Ph, 
etc.). Therefore we chose this type of complex to test the principle of transfer- 
ring an alkylidene fragment from an ylide to Ta. This paper reports the results 
employing phosphoranes as the alkylidene source.

The phosphine ligand (L) in TaCp,(L)Me can be displaced by CO or C2H4 to 
give the known [2] TaCp.(L’)Me complexes (L’ = CO or C,H,). Since TaCp,- 
(L)Me is an 18 electron complex, this most likely occurs via loss of L to give 
the 16 electron complex, “ TaCp,Me” (eq. ?)_ The TaCp,(L’)Me complexes do

irradiation of a mixture of TaCp,(C,H,)Me 
and PMe3 in C6D6 (medium pressure 
Hg lamp) produces TaCpz(PMe3)Me in high yield, presumably via the same 
“TaCp2Me” complex. Therefore TaCp,(L)Me can be prepared in good yield in a 
two stage reaction from TaCp,(CH,)Me 
(eq. 2); the first stage is the thermal

give TaCp,(CH,)Me,

Unfortunately, TaCp,(CH,)Me 
decomposes to TaCp,(C,H,)Me 
and “TaCp,- 
Me”, and reacts with Me,P=CH, to give TaCp*(C,H,)Me, 
not much more slowly 
than the rate at which it is formed [ 
2]_ Under these conditions the final prod- 
uct is TaCpJC,H,)Me, 
which does not react with Me3P=CH2 in 24 h at SO”C. 
On irradiation TaCp*(C,H,)Me 
does react with Me,P=CH, to give TaCp,(CH,)- 
Me, C2H,, and PMe3 (by ’ H NMR). 
[Therefore 
it is possible to catalyze the 
decomposition of Me3P=CH, to Me,P and ethylene with TaCp,(CH,)Me 
as long 
as the reaction is irradiated.] Clearly it is necessary to generate “TaCp,hae” 
either thermally (from TaCp,(PMe3)Me, eq. 3) or photochemically (from 
TaCp,(C,H,)Me) 
in order that Me3P=CH2 can coordinate to tantalum(III) to 
give short-lived I which loses PMe, to give TaCp,(CH,)Me 
(eq. 4).

Therefore 
it can be isolated in good 
yield. Its ‘H and 13C

bound to the metal. The cyclopentadienyl 
groups are inequivalent 
and give rise 
to two singlets (at 25”C, 
60 MHz) which suggests the ethylidene 
ligand is 
oriented roughly perpendicular 
to the C-Ta=C 
plane in this pseudo-tetrahedral 
molecule, 
as is found in TaCp,(CH,)Me 
and other members of this class (Ta- 
ble 1). Its 13C NMR spectrum is straightforward. 
The ethylidene 
a-carbon 
atom 
is found at 245 ppm with ‘J(CH,) 
125 HZ. 
The variable temperature 
‘H NMR spectra of TaCp2(CHPh)Me 
and TaCp,- 
(CHMe)Me 
both are characteristic 
of “rotation” 
of the alkylidene 
ligand from 
its roughly perpendicular 
orientation 
into the C-Ta=C 
plane [3]. The AG’ 
46 
value for TaCp,(CHPh)Me (17.9 + 0.2 kcal mol-’ at 331 K) differs only slightly 
from that for TaCp,(CHPh)(CH2Ph) 
(19.3 
kcal mol-’ 
at 349 K). (Differences 
in 
the order of 1 kcal mol-’ 
are probably 
not especially significant.) 
AG’ 
for 
TaCp,(CHMe)Me 
is somewhat 
higher (20.5 
kcal mol-‘) 
and the difference 
between it and TaCp,(CHPh)Me therefore may be significant; the results would 
suggest that a methyl group is not as sterically demanding as a phenyl group 
and the ethylidene ligand therefore is slightly more difficult to tip into the 
plane. 
The structures of TaCp,(CHPh)Me and TaCp,(CHMe)Me are probably very 
similar to that of TaCp,(CHPh)(CH,Ph) 
[ 
31 since 6(C,), ‘J(CH,), and AGf are 
nearly the same for the three, and since there seems to be a definite correlation 
between these parameters, 13,,,, and @ (Table 1); 6(C,), O,,,, and @ increase as 
‘J(CH,) and AG’,,t 
decrease_ 
We can therefore predict that the Ta=C,-Me 
angle in TaCp,(CHMe)Me will be in the order of 130”, and @, the amount the 
ethylidene ligand plane deviates from the perpendicular, will be in the order of 
55”. We cannot predict which way the ethylidene will be tipped based on these 
data alone. 
TaCp,(CHMe)Me begins to decompose at 70°C in benzene. The major prod- 
uct which we can see.by ‘H NMR has been isolated (in 32% yield) and identi- 
fied as TaCp,(propylene)H. 
One isomer is formed early in the decomposition 
reaction but the final mixture consists of what we propose is a l.Op~.8 mixture 
of the “exe” and “endo” isomers (ec;. 7); we do not know which one is formed

little TaCp,(propylene)H is found since ‘.t decomposes readily 
at this temperature. We should note that TaCp,(C,H,)Me, 
which we believed to 
be the most likely decomposition product and which is stable under the reac- 
tion conditions, was never found at any temperature. We have not been able to 
identify the insoluble brown precipitate. 
TaCp,(CHPh)Me begins to decompose at - 100°C but no single soluble orga- 
nometallic product predominates. In the presence of PMe, as a trapping agent 
we can identify TaCp,(PMe,)Me, 
toluert.2, 
2nd bibenzyl by ‘H NMR, a fact 
which suggests this decomposition is not straightforward_ TaCp,(CHPh)(CH,- 
Ph) is also more stable thermally than TaCp,(CHPh)Me and does not decom- 
pose to any recognizable soluble product.

Discussion 
Several groups have investigated the reaction of phosphorus ylides with tran- 
sition metal complexes in the past few years [ 
9]_ In no case has any evidence 
for alkylidene 
transfer baen found. Either the phosphorane 
attacks a ligand 
(e.g., CO) in preference to the metal, the alkylidene carbon atom bonds to the 
metal but the phosphi-.le does not leave, or other reactions of the initial com- 
47 
plex (such as loss of a proton from the alkylidene 
carbon atom between M and 
P) are faster than loss of the phosphine 
to give the alkylidenemetal 
complex. 
The second would be especially true if the alkylidene a-carbon 
atom in the 
hypothetical 
alkylidenemetal 
complex 
would not be nucleophilic 
(as it is here) 
but electrophilic, 
and would therefore remain strongly bound to the phosphine 
Lewis base. 
The initial attack of the ylide on the metal is best described as nucleophilic 
attack by the electron pair on the alkylidene 
carbon in R,%CHR’ 
on an empty 
Ta orbital; the electron pair in another Ta orbital eventually forms the r-com- 
ponent of the double bond. For steric reasons it is reasonable that the reaction 
slows down as R or R’ becomes 
larger (rate for R = Me > Ph; R’ = H > Et - 
Ph). 
Not surprisingly, therefore, 
we have not been able to transfer neopentylidene 
from Ph,P=CHCMe, 
to TaCp,(PMe,Ph)Me 
(eq. 8). The reaction would also

+ Ph,P=CHCMe,

(8) 
slow if the basic&y of the ylide decreases. This (along with the steric argu- 
ments) can explain why Et,P=CHC(=O)CH, 
will not react with TaCp,(PMe,- 
Ph)Me under similar conditions 
(eq. 9).

The alkylidene transfer reaction was successful not only because the prod- 
ucts are known species but probably 
also because the coordination 
sphere in 
this type of complex 
is severely crowded. 
The phosphine 
therefore may be lost 
more readily from the Ta-CHR’-PR3 
intermediate, 
but more importantly, 
CHR’ cannot be deprotonated 
by additional 
phosphorane 
before PR, leaves. It 
would be interesting to know if the alkylidene 
could be transferred successfully 
to a relatively uncrowded 
molecule_ 
TaCp,(CHMe)Me 
is the first example of a terminal etbylidene 
complex 
*_ 
Tne most important 
feature of an ethylidene 
ligand is that it has &hydrogen 
atoms yet does not rearrange to ethylene_ This should be compared 
with the 
postulated 
rearrangement 
of a =CPhMe ligand to styrene in (CO)SW(CPhMe) 
1111 ct1/2 
==30 min at -78°C 
in ether [lib]). 
ReCp(CO),(CPhhle) 
[12] 
and 
MnCp(CO),(CPhMe) 
j133 have been isolated but no data concerning how they 
decompose 
have appeared_ The only other complex 
of an alkylidene ligand 
which has P-hydrogen atoms is MnCp(CO)2(CMe2) 
[13,14]. 
Its mode of decom- 
position likewise is unknown. 
Since (CO),W(CPhMe), 
MCp(CO),(CPhMe) 
(M = Re or Mn), MnCp(CO),- 
(CMe,), 
and TaCp,(CHMe)Me 
are all 18 electron complexes, 
rearrangement 
may not necessarily depend on the availability of a proper metal coordination 
site, as is apparently 
the case for facile P-hydride elimination 
from an alkyl 
complex 
to give an olefin hydride intermediate 
[ 15 1. This is not unreasonable 
since, in contrast to p-elimination, 
an intermediate 
such as a vinyl hydride 
[ llb] 
does not involve an increase in the valence electron count of the metal.

[lo].

A smooth, facile, perhaps “metal-assisted” HP 
to C, shift may then depend 
primarily on whether the M=C,-Me 
angle is small. In MnCp(CO)l(CMez) 
1143 
the two are 126.2( 5)’ and 124.1( 5)” _ In TaCp,(CHMe)Me it is a ca. 130” (esti- 
mated; vide supra). But in a =CPhMe complex the M=C,-Me 
angle would 
probably be less than 125O due to the greater steric demands of the phenyl 
ring. One might argue that rearrangement. 
to styrene is especially favorable 
because the double bond is conjugated with the phenyl ring; but this is true in 
the M=CPhMe complex also and any such stabilizing effects therefore may 
cancel out. 
The way TaCp*(CHMe)Me does decompose is especially interesting if one 
makes the analogy between an alkylidene ligand and carbon monoxide. We pro- 
pose that the methyl group migrates to the alkylidene ligand to give intermedi- 
ate “TaCp2(CHMe2)” (which is analogous to “TaCp,Me”; 
vide supra) which 
then loses a &hydrogen atom 1151 to give TaCp.(propylene)H 
* (eq. 10). This 
is attractive since one would then predict that only one isomer forms first (as

we have observed) and that it would be the exe isomer (which we, unfortu- 
nately, cannot confirm independently)_ Migration of an alkyl to an alkylidene 
ligand would seem somewhat unusual, however, since it is apparently unfavor- 
able relative to elimination of alkane to give an alkylidyne ligand in the few 
cases which have been discovered so far :17]. Either migration of an alkyl to an 
alkylidene ligand is actually the mere general reaction (and loss of alkane to 
give the alkylidyne the exception) or elimination of alkane is “blocked” 
because Cp,Ta=CMe is a relatively high energy, unfavorable product. The latter 
certainly seems reasonable since the available bonding orbitals in the dicyclo- 
pentadienyl fragment all lie in the plane which passes between the iwo rings 
ClS]; i.e., none would be available to form the “out-of-plane” 
r-type bond. At 
this time, however, we cannot be certain that benzylidyne and neopentylidyne 
ligands are not exceptions, and therefore cannot choose between these two pos- 
sibilities. 
Experimental 
All operations were performed under nitrogen in a Vacuum Atmospheres 
Drybox or by Schlenk techniques. All solvents were dried by standard tech- 
niques under nitrogen. Alkylidene phosphoranes were prepared from phospho-
