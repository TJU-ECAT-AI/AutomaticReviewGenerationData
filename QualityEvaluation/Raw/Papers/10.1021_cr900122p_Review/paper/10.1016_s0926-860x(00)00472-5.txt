Abstract
Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pres-
sure. Conventional aqueous impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate was used for preparing catalysts with Mo loading
ranging from 0.3 to 3.3 wt.%. Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric
Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, poly-
molybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite
channels. A second catalyst series were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by aqueous impregnation and subsequent washing
with an aqueous ammonia solution, yielding Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts with Mo contents ranging from 0.08 to 0.45 wt.%. A
well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface
was characterized. Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity
values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate
the speciﬁcity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
In the last years, the direct conversion of methane
into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical com-
pounds has attracted great interest because of the
considerable increase in the world natural gas reserves
[1–3]. Among the different processes proposed, the
partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over
silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts has been
one of the most studied processes. However, in spite

of the great efforts made, formaldehyde yields are too
low for a possible industrial application.
The most recent papers about the use of MoO3/SiO2
catalysts in the title reaction have been focused on the
elucidation of the relationship between the structure
of the supported metal oxide phase and their role in
the reaction mechanism. Bañares et al. have proposed
that methane activation occurs through oxygen acti-
vation on the reduced sites of the supported molybde-
num oxide [4]. Parmaliana et al. showed the existence
of a straight correlation between the density of the re-
duced sites, evaluated in steady-state conditions by O2
chemisorption, and the reaction rate [5,6]. Moreover,
it has been shown that catalyst reducibility depends

on the interaction between the metal oxide phase and
the support surface varying with several factors such
as metal oxide loading and nature of the support [7,8].
Several active Mo sites have been described for
silica-supported molybdena catalysts. It seems to be a
general agreement in the catalytic role of each active
site in the methane partial oxidation [6,9–11]. Thus,
Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide
crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be
speciﬁc sites for HCOH production, while Mo–O–Mo
sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster
would lead to the total oxidation products.
Recently, we have reported the methane partial
oxidation to formaldehyde over tungsten oxide based
catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolite and SiO2
[12,13]. It was shown that both methane conversion
and formaldehyde selectivity are closely related to the
dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in
the catalyst. Thus, the relative high reducibility of the
poorly dispersed tungsten oxide species (mainly poly-
meric species) for loading higher than 4.0 wt.% lead
to a signiﬁcant increase in the methane conversion
values obtained for the catalysts [13]. On the other
hand, a relation between monomeric W species and
the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite was suggested
[12].
In this paper, we compete to demonstrate the speci-
ﬁcity of the monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in
the production of formaldehyde from methane. In the
ﬁrst place, we report the catalytic results obtained in
the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over
conventional aqueous impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alysts. Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts contain-
ing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group
of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by
impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia
aqueous solutions. Both catalyst series were charac-
terized in order to understand the structure of the sup-
ported molybdena phase.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
NaZSM-5 zeolite was prepared following a synthe-
sis procedure described elsewhere [14]. The product
was 100% crystalline (determined by X-ray diffrac-
tion) with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 90. Fully ex-
changed HZSM-5 (checked by chemical analysis) was
obtained by ion exchange of 10 g of the zeolite with
200 ml of 0.6 M aqueous solution of HCl followed by
drying at 110◦C for 14 h.
The Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by aque-
ous impregnation, according to an earlier procedure
[12]. The HZSM-5 zeolite powder was impregnated in
a rotary evaporator with aqueous solutions of ammo-
nium heptamolybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (10 ml
of solution/g zeolite). The concentration of the salt
was adequately selected in order to yield molybde-
num loading in the range 0.3–3.3 wt.%. After 4 h of
stirring at ambient temperature, the water was com-
pletely removed by evaporation at 70◦C under vac-
uum. Next, the impregnated samples were calcined in
air at 675◦C for 2.5 h. These catalysts will be named
to as ZMo x where x indicates the weight percentage
of molybdenum in the catalyst.
A different catalyst series was prepared from
HZSM-5 zeolite. The ﬁrst step of preparation method
was the aqueous impregnation with solutions of am-
monium heptamolybdate (with the same conditions
described above), obtaining uncalcined samples with
Mo loading in the range 2.0–6.6 wt.%. These ma-
terials were then further treated with an ammonia
aqueous solution in order to remove the physically
adsorbed molybdenum species of the catalysts. The
dry sample (10 g) was stirred for 5 min with 200 ml
of 1 M ammonia solution, then ﬁltered and repeatedly
washed with deionized water. Finally the samples
were dried at 110◦C for 4 h and calcined at 675◦C
for 2.5 h. These catalyst will be referred to as t-ZMo
x (treated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts), x indicating the
molybdenum loading of the samples.
2.2. Catalytic runs
Methane conversion tests were carried out at atmo-
spheric pressure in a ﬁxed bed installation previously
described [12,13]. It basically consisted of a gas feed
system for methane and oxygen (without diluent), a
ﬁxed bed quartz reactor (the dimensions of the reaction
zone were internal diameter 21.4 mm and length 6 cm)
and an exit gas ﬂowmeter. The reactor was heated
by means of an oven with three independently con-
trolled heating zones. A thermocouple was placed in
the center of the bed in order to measure the reaction

83
temperature (bed axial variation being only ±5◦C). A
Hewlett–Packard 5890A gas chromatograph was em-
ployed for the analysis of the feed and reactor efﬂuent
streams. A Porapak Q column was used to separate
CH4, CO2, CO+O2, HCOH and water and a molec-
ular sieve 5A packed column to separate CO and O2.
Calibration for formaldehyde was obtained with a 40%
HCOH aqueous solution.
In all the experiments, catalyst samples were pre-
treated ‘in situ’ in an oxygen ﬂow from the ambient
temperature to the reaction temperature, 600◦C, and
held at the latter approximately 1 h. Space velocity
of the feed was 7.41 g h mol−1 and the CH4:O2 mo-
lar ratio was 5.3:1. Approximately 2 h were required
to reach apparently steady state conditions. Sampling
of the product stream was repeated until the analyti-
cal results were reproducible. The carbon balance was
always better than 97% for all the runs.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Molybdenum analysis were carried out by atomic
absorption spectroscopy using a Varian SpectrAA-
220FS spectrometer. UV diffuse reﬂectance spectra
(UV DRS) were performed by using Spectralon as a
reference on a Perkin–Elmer Lambda-20 spectrome-
ter equipped with a diffuse reﬂectance accessory. The
spectra were recorded immediately after calcination
of the samples. The scanning wavelength range was
198–500 nm and the scan speed was 120 nm/min. BET
surface area and micropore volumes of the calcined
samples were measured by using a Quantachrome
Autosorb-1 apparatus with nitrogen as the adsorbate.
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on
a Philips PW1710 diffractometer using Cu Ka ra-
diation. TEM images were recorded using a JEOL
JEM-2000 FX transmission electron microscope op-
erating at 200 kV. TPR experiments were recorded
on a Micromeritics TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples
were pretreated from ambient temperature to 675◦C in
argon ﬂow. Following pretreatment, TPR experiments
were run in a 17% H2/Ar stream (50 N cm3/min)
heating up to 900◦C at a rate of 10◦C/min. During
this time the exit gas was monitored using a TCD
detector. Total acid site density of the catalysts was
measured by a temperature-programmed desorption
of ammonia (TPDA) by means of a Micromeritics
TPD/TPR analyzer. The samples were housed in a
quartz tubular reactor and pretreated in ﬂowing he-
lium while heating at 15◦C/min to 675◦C. After a
period of 30 min at 675◦C, the samples were cooled
at 180◦C and saturated by ﬂowing a pure ammonia
stream for 15 min. The catalyst was then allowed to
equilibrate under helium ﬂow at 180◦C for 1 h. Fi-
nally, the ammonia was desorbed by using a linear
heating rate of 15◦C/min up to 675◦C. Temperature
and detector signals were simultaneously recorded.
The unique area under the curve was integrated to
determine the total acidity of the catalyst. The uptake
of ammonia is used to represent the number of strong
acid sites on the catalyst.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the supported molybdena
phase
Molybdenum content and micropore volumes of the
two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series are shown in Table 1.
Since there is a straight relationship between the mi-
cropore volume and the BET surface area values, the
latter are not included here. The important decrease
of molybdenum loading observed for treated catalysts
taking into account the initial values is noticeable.
Therefore, the treatment with NH3(aq) lets us to re-
move a signiﬁcant amount of molybdenum species,
presumably the physisorbed ones. It can be seen that,
for ZMo catalyst series, micropore volume decreased
with increasing amounts of molybdenum. This fact, at-
tributed to the partial blocking of the zeolite channels
caused by the entrance or deposition of molybdenum
species, has been reported by other authors [15,16].
On the other hand, the decrease in micropore volume
is lower for the treated catalysts than for the untreated
ones. Two reasons may be suggested for this result:
lower molybdenum loading and higher dispersion of
the surface species. This last assumption is supported
by the difference existing between the micropore val-
ues of catalysts from different series, i.e. t-ZMo 0.28
and ZMo 0.3 catalysts.
In Fig. 1 are shown the UV diffuse reﬂectance spec-
tra of the ZMo catalysts with different molybdenum
loadings. For all the samples the spectrum consists of
two overlapped bands at 220 nm and about 275 nm.

assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated Mo(VI) species
while the other band at about 275 nm could be assigned
to octahedral polyoxomolybdate Mo(VI) species. In

the inset of Fig. 1 is shown the spectrum of solid
molybdenum trioxide which presents a characteristic
major band at about 325 nm. On the basis of the broad
nature of the UV bands, these results do not let us
to discard the presence of a crystalline MoO3 phase
in the ZMo samples. XRD patterns of the ZMo cat-
alyst series (Fig. 2) do not show MoO3 diffraction
peaks. However, with the XRD technique, crystallites
larger than ∼50 Å can only be detected and, so, the
formation of three-dimensional structures of MoO3 of
smaller size could occur. Studies by Xu et al. [15] and
Chen et al. [16] reported the presence of MoO3 crystal-
lites in Mo/HZSM-5 for Mo loading higher than 10%.
According to the latter, if the Mo loading was below
this value, most of the molybdenum species would be

located in the channels of the HZSM-5 zeolite while if
it was above this value, an isolated molybdenum triox-
ide phase and polymolybdenum oxide species would
appear on the external surface of the catalyst. Simi-
lar results were reported by Kohler et al. [18], in a
study carried out over molybdenum oxide supported
on alumina. Nevertheless, the absence of the MoO3
crystallites in the ZMo catalyst series was conﬁrmed
by obtaining the TEM images of the highest loaded
samples (ZMo 1.3 and ZMo 3.3).
UV DRS spectra of the treated catalyst are shown
in Fig. 3. It can be seen that all the spectra show a ma-
jor band at 220 nm with a shoulder at about 275 nm.
In contrast with ZMo series, supported molybdenum
phase in t-ZMo catalyst series mainly consists of tetra-
hedral monomeric species. The presence of the 275 nm
shoulder could be attributed to the existence of a low
amount of polymolybdate species strongly adsorbed
on the zeolite surface. As expected, the XRD patterns
of the t-ZMo catalysts do not show peaks correspond-
ing to crystalline MoO3 (Fig. 2). The absence of a
MoO3 phase in the t-ZMo catalysts was supported by
the TEM image of the t-ZMo 0.45 sample.

ture range 400–800◦C. The TPR proﬁle of bulk MoO3
exhibits two peaks at 590 and 700◦C. The mol H2 con-
sumed/mol Mo ratio obtained for MoO3 was 2.86 in-
dicating the almost complete reduction of the sample
under the experimental conditions used in this work.
For all the ZMo catalysts a broad peak appears at
550–660◦C, its intensity increasing when the molyb-
denum loading increases. The existence of a single
reduction peak for ZMo catalysts seems to point out
an incomplete reduction of the surface molybdenum
species caused by the interaction with the zeolite sup-
port. Likewise, in Table 1 are listed the relative re-
ducibility values of the ZMo catalysts, deﬁned as H2
consumption per mol of molybdenum for the sam-
ple to H2 consumption per mol of molybdenum for
the bulk MoO3 ratio. An increase in this parameter
for the higher-loaded catalysts is observed indicating
that the aggregation of the molybdenum oxide species
yields to a signiﬁcant increase of the degree of cat-
alyst reduction. It has been reported for MoO3/SiO2
catalysts [7] that the dispersed surface molybdenum
species are less reducible than the polymeric ones.
Thus, the TPR results would show that the disper-
sion of the supported molybdenum oxide phases de-
creases gradually as the Mo loading increases. On the
other hand, the TPR patterns of the t-ZMo catalysts

(Fig. 4) do not show any hydrogen consumption in the
range 400–800◦C with exception to the highest loaded
catalyst. For this catalyst series, the absence of TPR
peaks for Mo loading lower than 0.28 wt.% could be
attributed to the low intensity of the TPR signal. How-
ever, if TPR proﬁles of the t-ZW 0.28 and ZW 0.3
catalysts are compared, the lower reducibility of the
treated sample can be pointed out. Moreover, the TPR
proﬁles in Fig. 4 shows that the t-ZW 0.45 sample is
reduced at a higher temperature than that of ZW cat-
alyst series, its relative reducibility being lower than
that of the ZW 0.3 sample (Table 1). These ﬁndings
strongly agree with the UV DRS results concerning to
the monomeric nature of the supported Mo species in
treated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. According to TPR re-
sults, these hardly reducible species would be joined
to the zeolite support and therefore well dispersed
(Fig. 5).
The effect of molybdenum on the acidity of the cat-
alysts was evaluated by TPD of ammonia. It can be
seen in Fig. 6 that in both catalyst series the num-
ber of acid sites decreased as Mo loading increases.
However, this decrease exhibits a different trend for
the two series. For ZMo catalysts, relative acidity de-
creases sharply for Mo loading up to 1.3 wt.%, be-
ing less pronounced for higher contents. It suggests a
poor dispersion of the molybdenum species for high
Mo loading and, therefore, the presence of polymeric
species. In contrast, the almost linear decrease of the
relative acidity of the t-ZMo catalysts (with except of
the highest loaded sample) indicates an uniform and

relatively well-dispersed Mo oxide phase. This fact
supports the results obtained with other characteriza-
tion techniques.
3.2. Methane oxidation
The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with
molecular oxygen over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts leads
to the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O. The
catalytic results for all the catalysts and HZSM-5 ze-
olite are summarized in Table 2. The contribution
of the homogeneous reaction in the pre-heated zone
of the reactor used in this work was reported to be
∼0.8 mol%, carbon oxides being the unique products
formed (mainly CO2) [13]. This contribution was not
taken into account in the methane conversion values
since it is equal for all the runs.

a Formaldehyde Space Time Yield.
b Reaction conditions: T=600◦C; W/F=7.41 g h mol−1; molar ratio CH4/O2=5.3.
The great activity of HZSM-5 in methane oxida-
tion reaction at 650◦C (methane conversion equal to
11.4 mol%), leading to the total oxidation products
(mainly CO) was reported in a previous work [12]. It
was demonstrated that the acid sites of the HZSM-5
were the active centers for methane activation. Prod-
uct distribution obtained in the reaction at 600◦C is
essentially the same although the methane conversion
is smaller (Table 2).
With respect to Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, it can be
observed that methane conversion values obtained for
ZMo catalysts are higher than those of the t-ZMo se-
ries. For the ZMo series this parameter increases up
to 1.3 wt.% Mo loading then decreases slightly for
higher contents. For treated catalysts methane con-
version decreases up to 4.6 wt.% initial Mo loading
and then remains essentially constant. On the other

hand, t-ZMo catalysts (except with the two lowest
Mo loadings) exhibit formaldehyde selectivity val-
ues signiﬁcantly higher than those of the ZMo series
(approximately two times). Consequently, formalde-
hyde yields reached with t-ZMo catalysts are higher
than those of the ZMo series. In Fig. 7 selectivities
to formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and carbon diox-
ide are plotted versus the Mo loading for both catalyst
series. For ZMo catalysts, an increase of Mo loading
leads to a decrease in HCOH and CO selectivities and
an increase in CO2 one. For t-ZMo series, HCOH and
CO2 selectivities increase up to 0.2 wt.% of Mo. The
opposite trend is seen for CO selectivity. Therefore, a
signiﬁcant difference in catalytic behavior of the two
catalyst series must be established: for the ZMo series,
HCOH and CO2 selectivities exhibit opposite trends
whereas for the t-ZMo series the CO selectivity is
88
A. de Lucas et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 203 (2000) 81–90
the opposite to that of HCOH (for Mo loading up to
0.2 wt.%). These facts will be discussed in Section 4.2.
It must be noted that the formaldehyde space-time
yield values obtained with Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are
similar than those previously reported by the authors
for HZSM-5 and SiO2 supported tungsten catalysts
[12,13]. Likewise, these results are comparable to
those obtained by other authors for MoO3/SiO2 cata-
lysts under several experimental conditions [19–23].
4. Discussion
4.1. Surface molybdenum species
It has been pointed out that the structure of the sup-
ported oxide phase in Mo/SiO2 catalysts follows the
metal oxide aqueous chemistry as a function of the net
surface at point of zero charge (PZC) [18,24,25]. The
changes in the structure of molybdenum anions with
pH and molybdenum concentration have been well
characterized [24]. The equilibrium between hepta-
molybdate species and monomeric species is described
by the equation:
Mo7O246−+ 4H2O ⇄7MoO42−+ 8H+
At Mo concentrations above 10−4 M and below pH
6.8, Mo7O244−(Oh) is formed whereas above pH
7, MoO42−(Td) predominates in solution. Therefore,
polyoxomolybdate species are predominant in the im-
pregnation solution used in the catalyst preparation,
since a pH of approximately 3.7 was measured. As-
suming an acidic PZC for the zeolite surface, these
species would be mainly adsorbed on the protonated
sites by electrostatic forces in a similar way to that de-
scribed by Mulcahy et al. for alumina catalysts [26].
The UV diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy results seem
to conﬁrm this assumption. Thus, a characteristic band
at 275 nm owning to polymolybdate octahedral species
appears in the UV diffuse reﬂectance spectra for all
the ZMo catalysts (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, an additional
band at 220 nm, assigned to tetrahedral Mo species, is
seen for all the catalysts. Moreover, this band is the
major one for catalysts with Mo contents lower than
1.3 wt.%. This fact seem to indicate that during the
impregnation and/or calcination stages some molyb-
denum species enter in the channels of the zeolite
and interact with the Brönsted sites forming tetrahe-
dral Mo species. This phenomena has been reported
for Mo/HZSM-5 [15,16] and W/HZSM-5 catalysts
[12].
Likewise, the physical nature of the interaction
between HZSM-5 surface and polymolybdate species
has been shown by means of NH3(aq) washing of the
impregnated catalysts. In fact, this treatment drasti-
cally decreases the total Mo loading of the samples
(Table 1) remaining almost exclusively the monomeric
tetrahedral Mo species for t-ZMo catalysts (Fig. 3).
It would demonstrate that the isolated tetrahedral Mo
species are chemically joined to the support surface.
The straight-line decrease of the relative acidity ob-
served for the treated catalyst up to 0.28 wt.% Mo
loading (Fig. 5) gives evidence that these structures
are formed on the Brönsted acid sites of HZSM-5
zeolite (Fig. 7). Similar monomeric Mo species have
been the unique ones detected in a Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alyst synthesized by the authors using MoO2(acac)2
as molybdenum source [27]. Likewise, if catalysts
owning to different series with a similar Mo content
are compared, i.e. ZMo 0.3 and t-ZMo 0.28, it can
be seen that for the treated catalyst relative acidity
is lower. It means that for this treated sample a well
dispersed molybdena phase is present.
On the other hand, in spite of the acidic PZC of
the silica several authors have reported the existence
of monomeric species onto the surface of low loaded
Mo/SiO2 [7,17,28,29]. Therefore, it seems that other
factors exist, i.e. the preparation method, the Mo load-
ing and the presence of speciﬁc sites, inﬂuencing in
some manner on the nature of the supported surface
molybdena phase.
The following general picture can be concluded
from the characterization results of the two catalyst
series. For ZMo series, all the samples own both
monomeric and polymeric Mo species forming a
not-well dispersed supported molybdena phase. The
former is the predominant for Mo loading below
1.3 wt.% while the latter is the most important for
higher contents. Due to their large size, polymolyb-
date species are located on the external surface of
the support blocking its channels in some extent.
Monomeric tetrahedral species are mainly into the
zeolite pores presumably joined to the zeolite surface.
For t-ZMo series a well-dispersed molybdenum oxide
phase mainly constituted of monomeric tetrahedral

Mo species joined to the Brönsted acid sites of the
HZSM-5 zeolite is observed.
4.2. Catalytic activity
The catalytic results (Table 2) clearly point out
that the active sites of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts for the
formaldehyde production belong to the molybdenum
oxide phase since HZSM-5 leads to total oxidation
products. This fact is noticeable even for the lowest
molybdenum loaded catalyst (t-ZMo 0.08).
When the Mo loading increases the progressive cov-
erage of the support surface by molybdenum species
leads to a gradual decrease in the active sites of the
zeolite for methane activation. This fact would explain
the decrease in methane conversion obtained for the
ZMo 0.3 catalyst (Table 2). For higher loaded ZMo
samples, the activity of supported molybdena phase
compensates this decrease and a progressive increase
is seen for methane conversion reaching a maximum
for 1.3 wt.% (Table 2). However, this trend is not ob-
served for t-ZMo series where a quite similar methane
conversion was achieved for all the Mo contents used
(Table 2). This result could be explained on the basis
of the different natures of the Mo species in both cat-
alyst series. Parmaliana et al. [5,22] have shown that
the reducibility of the molybdenum oxide phase is the
key for the oxygen activation and subsequently, for
methane activation. According to it, the high reducibil-
ity of polyoxomolybdate species makes it more reac-
tive than the hardly reducible monomeric Mo species.
The speciﬁcity of the M=O sites (M=Mo, W,
V) of terminal atoms in metal oxide crystallites or
isolated monomeric species in the selective produc-
tion of HCOH from methane over MoO3, WO3 and
V2O5 silica supported catalysts have been established
[6,8–11,13,27]. The results presented here seem to
agree with this idea. Thus, for ZMo catalysts HCOH
selectivity reaches a maximum value for the low-
est loaded sample, further decreasing as the amount
of polymolybdate species increases (Fig. 6). Like-
wise, higher formaldehyde values are obtained for
the treated catalysts mainly constituted of monomeric
Mo species (Table 2). For this series the maximum
value is reached for 0.20 wt.%. The low selectivity
obtained for the two lowest loaded catalysts could
be attributed to two reasons: the activity of exposed
acid sites of the HZSM-5 surface and the absence
of nearest-neighbor molybdenum species capable of
providing both active oxygen and methane/methyl
radical adsorption sites [7].
On the other hand, in Section 3.2, for the two cat-
alyst series, a discrepancy on the relation between
HCOH and carbon oxides selectivities as the Mo
loading increases (Fig. 6). The reason for these re-
sults can be supported from the different kind of
Mo species present in both catalyst series. For ZMo
catalysts, the increase in polymolybdate species as
increasing Mo loading promotes the total oxidation of
methane to carbon dioxide over Mo–O–Mo function-
alities [8,10,11,29]. However, for t-ZMo catalysts the
gradual covering of active sites of zeolite surface by
isolated tetrahedral Mo species leads to an increasing
HCOH selectivity and a parallel decrease in CO se-
lectivity. The apparently contradictory slight decrease
in the HCOH selectivity observed for the two highest
loaded samples may be attributed to the total oxidation
to CO2 over the residual polyoxomolybdate species.
All the effects pointed out above can be visualized if
the catalytic results of two catalysts of different series
with similar Mo loading, i.e. ZMo 0.3 and t-ZMo 0.28,
are compared. In Table 2, the following ﬁndings can
be observed for t-ZMo 0.28 sample with respect to
ZMo 0.3 one: methane conversion and CO selectivity
are lower whereas formaldehyde selectivity is higher.
These facts can be explained taking into account that
Mo dispersion is higher for t-ZMo 0.28 catalyst than
ZMo 0.3 one, and therefore being lower the number
of exposed acid sites of HZSM-5.
5. Conclusions
The aqueous impregnation of HZSM-5 zeolite
with ammonium heptamolybdate leads to catalysts
with two different kinds of supported molybdenum
species: isolated tetrahedral oxo-species presumably
joined to the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite and
octahedral polyoxomolybdenum species. The rela-
tive amount of these two types of species changes
with the molybdenum loading. At low contents (up
to 1.3 wt.%), molybdenum tetrahedral species mainly
located into the channels of the zeolite predominate.
For higher loadings polymolybdate species are pre-
dominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a
partial blocking up of the channels of the HZSM-5

zeolite. Washing of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 with
aqueous ammonia solutions removes almost com-
pletely the physisorbed polymeric species leading to
a well-dispersed molybdena phase mainly constituted
of tetrahedral monomeric Mo species. Both catalyst
series show different activity in methane conversion.
Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than
acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selec-
tivity values. In contrast, treated catalysts show lower
methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity.
Thus, the best formaldehyde yields are obtained for
treated catalysts. These results demonstrate the speci-
ﬁcity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for
HCOH production.
