Three aspects of the surface chemistry and catalytic activity of organometalhc 
complexes on 
alumina are covered with particular attention to the effect of the surface concentration 
of OH- 
present after various degrees of dehydroxylation. 
(1) The formation of Lewis acid-Lewis 
base pair 
sites during dehydroxylation 
of alumina. (2) The effect of the degree of dehydroxylation 
upon the 
course of the reaction of MOM 
with the surface of alumina during heating in He and in Hr. 
Variously activated Mo(CO)dAlz03 
are catalysts for the hydrogenation of propylene, the exchange 
of alkanes with Dz, the hydrogenolysis of alkanes, the hydrogenolysis of cyclopropane, the hydro- 
genation of CO, and the metathesis of olefins. Metallic 
Mo(0)/A1203 is among the most active 
catalysts known for the first three reactions. (3) Organoactinide 
complexes on alumina. The com- 
plexes (Cp’),Th(CH&, 
(Cp’),U(CH&, 
and (Cp’),ThHz 
(where Cp’ is pentamethylcyclopenta- 
dienyl) lead to very active catalysts for the hydrogenation of propylene at -63°C and the polymer- 
ization of ethyiene at 25°C. The surface chemistry of the reactions of the complexes with the 
surface of alumina during activation has been partially elucidated. High catalytic activity is favored 
by nearly complete dehydroxylation 
of the alumina support. 
INTRODUCTION 
Three aspects of our work on organome- 
tallic complexes 
on alumina 
will be consid- 
ered here: (1) the direct demonstration 
of 
the occurrence 
of Lewis acid-Lewis 
base 
pair sites on alumina, 
(2) the surface chem- 
istry and catalytic 
activity 
of materials 
de- 
rived from Mo(CO)dA&Os 
with particular 
attention 
to metallic 
molybdenum 
on alu- 
mina, and (3) the surface chemistry 
and cat- 
alytic activity 
of organoactinide 
complexes 
on alumina. 
Two of these investigations 
in- 
volved collaboration 
with colleagues in the 
inorganic 
group at Northwestern 
Univer- 
sity and that work required 
knowledge 
and 
techniques 
which 
my 
laboratory 
alone 
could not have provided. 
The research on 
Lewis acid-Lewis 
base sites was in collabo-

ration with Duward F. Shriver and that on 
organoactinides 
with Tobin J. Marks. 
There has recently 
been considerable 
in- 
terest in organometallic 
complexes 
depos- 
ited upon oxide 
supports 
(2). The work 
may be classified in two categories (a) the 
complex 
is decomposed 
to form 
a sup- 
ported metal or metal ion and (b) the initial 
complex 
or some derived 
complex 
is re- 
tained. 
Both types of materials 
appear in 
the work reported 
here. In some cases sil- 
ica and alumina 
function 
in rather similar 
ways. In the present work, however, 
the 
use of alumina 
was either necessary or it 
led to much higher activities 
than silica gel. 
Features of the surface chemistry 
of alu- 
mina (2) which are essential to the present 
purpose follow. The crystal lattice of y-alu- 
mina resembles that of a spinel. It involves 
a cubic close-packed 
lattice of 02- ions in 
which AP+ ions are distributed 
among the 
octahedral 
and the tetrahedral 
holes. The 
texture of usual samples of y-A&O3 is rather 
like that of a loose, cemented 
gravel bed in

which the primary 
particles 
are crystalline 
r-A&O, 
of a diameter 
of about 10 nm. The 
surface of a sample of Y-A1203 prepared by 
the usual wet methods 
is fully hydroxyl- 
ated, that is, the surface is covered by OH- 
ions to be designated 
V-OH. Such a surface 
is represented 
schematically 
in Fig. 
1. 
Upon 
heating 
hydroxylated 
alumina 
to 
above about 
2OO”C, dehydroxylation 
be- 
gins. As shown in the figure, two C-OH re- 
act to form water which desorbs and a sur- 
face oxide ion, to be represented 
u-O- (3). 
It also forms a surface vacancy in the oxy- 
gen-ion 
lattice 
which to some degree ex- 
poses an aluminum 
ion A13+ (cus) where cus 
indicates 
that the ion is a “coordinatively 
unsaturated 
surface” 
species. As such, it 
should be a Lewis acid. The Os2- (or u-O-) 
species is coordinated 
to fewer A13+ than an 
oxide ion in bulk would be. o-O- should be 
a Lewis base. Dehydroxylation 
occurs to a 
degree which increases as the temperature 
of treatment 
increases. 
At about 47X, 
a 
temperature 
we 
commonly 
employed, 
about 4 of the original 
15 u-OH 
per nm2 
remain. 
By about 950°C 
the alumina 
has 
become 
nearly 
but not completely 
dehy- 
droxylated; 
about 0.12 o-OH 
remain 
per 
nm* (4). The alumina 
has also become par- 
tially converted 
to b-alumina. 
The hydrox- 
ylated, partially 
dehydroxylated 
(at 475”C), 
and nearly completely 
dehydroxylated 
alu- 
minas (at -950°C) 
will be designated 
HA, 
PDA, and DA, respectively. 
In the present work we usually employed 
a 99.99% pure y-alumina 
of the American 
Cyanamid 
Company, 
designated PHF, a, = 
160 m* g-l, pore volume 
= 0.6 cm3 g-r, and 
average pore diameter 
= 12 nm (4). Equiv- 
alently 
pure 
materials, 
Catapal 
SB and 
transparent 
alumina 
foil used for infrared 
studies, appeared 
to exhibit 
the same be- 
havior . 
All of the organometallic 
complexes 
on 
alumina 
were very sensitive to oxygen. We 
avoided 
exposing 
our catalysts 
to vacua 
and, 
instead, 
effected 
dehydroxylations, 
catalyst 
preparations, 
catalyst 
pretreat- 
ments and catalytic 
reactions in flowing he- 
lium or hydrogen 
in which the contents in 
oxygen were less than 0.03 ppm as mea- 
sured at the catalyst (4). Such products 
of 
activation 
or reaction 
as CO, 
CH4, and 
C2H6 were removed from flowing helium by 
adsorption 
upon 
silica 
gel 
at 
- 196°C. 
Warming 
led to the release of a pulse of 
products 
suitable for gas chromatography. 
Hydrogen 
was adsorbed 
from 
helium 
on 
molecular 
sieve (5A) at -196°C 
and mea- 
sured after conversion 
to water. 
LEWIS ACID-LEWIS BASE PAIR SITES 
ON 
ALUMINA (F. Correa, R. Nakamura, 
and R. E. Stimson) 
H. Pines appears to have been the first to 
propose 
the 
simultaneous 
presence 
of 
acidic and basic catalytic 
sites on alumina. 
The work described 
here aimed 
at estab- 
lishing that the two sites could occur in im- 
mediately 
adjacent locations. 
D. F. Shriver and co-workers had shown 
that the diphilic 
properties 
of such molecu- 
lar acids as aluminum 
bromide 
led to strong 
promotion 
of the methyl 
migration 
reaction 
in certain 
complexes 
containing 
CH3 and 
CO ligands (5).

Structure I was confirmed 
by X-ray diffrac- 
tion. Here, AP+ serves as a Lewis acid and 
the Br- as a base to provide 
an enormous 
acceleration 
in the rate of the migration 
of 
the CH3 group. It occurred 
to us that the 
A13+(cus) ion of the surface of a dehydrox- 
ylated alumina 
might 
similarly 
serve as an 
acid in conjunction 
with a u-O- serving as a 
base. Accordingly, 
a pentane 
solution 
of 
the manganese complex 
was injected onto a 
transparent 
alumina 
foil in an infrared cell 
past which a current of helium 
was flowing 
(6). There 
was an immediate 
change in 
color as the solution 
came in contact with 
the alumina, 
but 
there 
was no further 
change in color during the evaporation 
of 
the pentane. 
The infrared absorption 
spec- 
trum 
of the sample 
was determined 
and 
found to be very close to that of compound 
I. Essentially 
identical 
results 
were ob- 
tained for PDA and for DA. Further, 
negli- 
gible liberation 
of methane or hydrogen ac- 
companied 
the evaporation 
of the pentane 
solvent. Thus, the product of adsorption 
of 
the manganese complex 
is 
CH3 
/ 
(C0)4Mn-C 
A1,3+ 
and the surface of dehydroxylated 
alumina 
provides 
Lewis acid-Lewis 
base pair sites 
which are within a few tenths of a nanome- 
ter from each other. Further, 
protonolysis 
of M-CH3 
by o-OH 
on PDA to form meth- 
ane is slow vs methyl migration. 
Similar 
re- 
action of ($-C5Hs)Fe(CH3)(CO),

curred 
immediately 
upon 
injection 
of a

foil 
(6). 
In the work just described, an organome- 
tallic 
complex 
served to provide 
informa- 
tion about the nature of the surface of alu- 
mina. 
Such a reaction 
could not occur on 
the surface of pure silica since that surface 
is devoid of Lewis acid sites. The next two 
sections are more concerned with the cata- 
lytic properties 
of the products of deposit- 
ing organometallic 
complexes 
on alumina. 
MATERIALS 
STARTING 
AS Mo(CO)dA1203 
Catalysts 
prepared 
by 
activating 
MO 
(CO)dA1203 
were first reported 
by Banks 
and Bailey 
in 1964 (7) and the olefin me- 
tathesis reaction 
was discovered 
on one of 
these catalysts (7, 8). These materials 
were 
among the first organometallic 
complexes 
supported on oxides to be used as catalysts. 
Whan and colleagues 
at Edinburgh 
investi- 
gated the catalytic 
activity 
of these materi- 
als for the metathesis 
of olefins and they 
correlated 
this activity 
with the results of ir, 
EPR, 
and XPS 
studies (see leading 
Ref. 
(9)). This work showed that activation 
to 
higher temperatures 
in an inert gas led the 
evolution 
of CO to accompany 
the develop- 
ment 
of catalytic 
activity, 
but the Edin- 
burgh group did not analyze the gases liber- 
ated during activation 
and for a while they 
prepared the Mo(CO)dPDA 
in air. Such a 
preparation 
would appear to be quite rea- 
sonable since MOM 
itself is air stable. 
However, 
Mo(CO)dAlz03 
turns out to be 
air sensitive even at 25°C. Our attention 
to 
these catalysts was attracted by the work of 
Whan and we started an investigation 
of 
these materials 
about 10 years ago with the 
doctoral 
research of A. Brenner 
(IO), but

here I shall discuss the subsequent 
work 
done by R. G. Bowman, 
C. Defosse, R. 
Nakamura, 
M. Laniecki, 
and D. Pioch. 
Surface 
Chemistry 
For background 
it will be necessary to 
present 
some 
of the 
surface 
chemistry 
which 
accompanies 
the 
activation 
of 
Mo(CO)dAlfOs 
in flowing hydrogen 
or he- 
lium (4). 
Activating 
Mo(CO&iPDA 
in He or H2 to 
100°C leads to the formation 
of MOM/ 
PDA 
in which 
surface ligands 
have re- 
placed CO (II, 
22). Elevation 
of the tem- 
perature 
in He to above 
100°C leads to 
further 
liberation 
of CO starting 
at about 
150°C. Carbon 
monoxide 
is accompanied 
by hydrogen 
and small amounts 
of meth- 
ane. At 3OO”C, the products are roughly 
Mo(CO),/PDA 
+ 2.7 CO + H2 
+ 0.1 CH4 + MO-2+/PDA 
The surface reactions 
involved 
can be rep- 
resented approximately 
by 
Mo(CO)dPDA 
+ 
[Mo]/PDA 
+ 3C0 
(1) 
[MO] + 2o-OH 
+ 
Mo2+ 2u-O- 
+ H2 
(2) 
Formation 
of H2 and CH4, first observed 
with Mo(CO),#DA, 
has since been found 
to occur rather generally 
with metal 
car- 
bonyls on alumina. 
Mo2+ represents only an 
average oxidation 
number and as shown by 
EPR even a little MO(V) is formed. Heating 
above 300°C results in further liberation 
of 
H2 and further oxidation 
of MO(B) and by 
5oo”C, the MO is mostly 
Mo(V1). 
Heating 
in flowing H2 results in the oc- 
currence 
of reaction 
1 accompanied 
by 
roughly 
an equal amount 
of reaction 
3. 
[MO] presumably 
then reacts as in 
Mo-CO 
+ 3H2 --, 
[MO] + CH4 + H20 
(3) 
reaction 
2 and some of the H20 from reac- 
tion 3 further 
oxidizes 
Mo2+. By H2,300”, 
1 (which denotes heating in H2 at 300°C for 
1 hr), the oxidation 
number 
of MO has an 
average value of about +3. 
When Mo(CO)&A 
is heated in helium, 
a 
reaction 
equivalent 
to 1 occurs, 
but the 
amount 
of o-OH 
present is insufficient 
to 
oxidize 
most 
of the [MO] 
formed. 
After 
DA;He,300-500” 
(which 
means 
that 
Mo(CO)&A 
is heated 
in He 
to 300- 
SOO”C), the results can be represented 
in a 
typical case approximately 
by 
Mo(CO)s/DA 
--f 
0.85 MO(O) + 0.15 Mo2+ + 0.3 C 
If the sample is now heated in HZ, methane 
liberation 
starts at about 400 and by 65O”C, 
C/MO on the catalyst has been reduced to 
0.01 and by 950°C the catalyst 
consists of 
pure MO(O) supported 
on DA (4). This ap- 
pears to have been the first preparation 
of a 
supported 
metallic 
molybdenum 
catalyst. 
Judging from the extent of CO chemisorp- 
tion, the percentage 
exposed of MO would 
be in the vicinity 
of 30%. 
The first step in the preparation 
of all of 
these Mo/A1203 
catalysts, 
the reaction 
of 
MOM 
with the surface of alumina, 
is a 
curious 
one. The usual substitution 
reac- 
tions of the carbonyl itself are very sluggish 
and temperatures 
above 100°C are needed 
for significant 
rates. Yet substitution 
of CO 
by surface ligands of alumina 
starts even at 
25°C. The following 
reaction 
is known in 
I 
-I 
M- co+oli- 
/O 
M-C, 
OH 
solution (II, 
12). Formation 
of the COOH- 
group labilizes 
a c&CO 
and facilitates 
its 
substitution, 
for example, 
by phosphines. 
Probably, 
then u-O- 
or u-OH 
functions 
in 
the same fashion and promotes 
the substi- 
tution of CO by other cr-O- or cr-OH (II).

procedures

Table 1 gives a general 
overview of the catalytic 
activities 
of mate- 
rials prepared 
by four particular 
pretreat- 
ments which were chosen to typify the gen- 
eral range of catalytic 
behaviors. 
A few 
specific comments 
on the details of each 
reaction follows. 
Metathesis 
The largest activity 
for metathesis 
results 
from 
sites which start as Mo~‘(cus), 
N( 
(turnover 
frequency 
per MO) was 0.15 at 
60°C. Only a small fraction 
of these sites 
become 
converted 
to sites active for me- 
tathesis (20). Presumably, 
precursor 
sites 
are converted 
to Mo=CHR 
species which 
effect metathesis 
by the Chauvin-Herrison 
mechanism. 
The oxidation 
number of MO in 
these sites is presumably 
higher than that.in 
the precursor 
sites. 
Hydrogenation of Propylene 
(R. G. Bowman and M. Laniecki) 
Many 
of the 
variously 
activated 
MO 
(CO)dA1203 materials 
are catalysts for the 
hydrogenation 
of olefins (13, 14). 
At 60°C in a pulse reactor using hydrogen 
carrier, 
Mo(CO)~IPDA 
catalyzes 
simulta- 
neously the metathesis 
and the hydrogena- 
tion of propylene. 
Increase in the pretreat- 
ment temperature 
in helium 
causes the rate 
of both reactions 
to increase, 
but that of 
hydrogenation 
increases 
much more rap- 
idly than that of metathesis 
and conver- 
sions in hydrogenation 
become 
100% even 
at 0°C. We, therefore, 
had to study hydro- 
genation 
at -46°C 
in a flowing mixture 
of 
propylene 
and hydrogen. 
Under these con- 
ditions, no products of metathesis 
were ob- 
served. 
Figure 2 shows conversion 
in hydrogena- 
tion at -46°C 
for catalysts 
with four dif- 
ferent 
pretreatments 
vs loading 
of MO. 
Conversions 
for 
PDA;He,300”, 
1 
were 
readily 
measured. 
The catalyst, 
PDA,H2, 
300”,1 
provided 
more 
difficulty, 
since 
even with only 0.7 mg of MO on 0.25 g of 
PDA, 
conversions 
were almost 
100%. DA; 
He or H,,300”,1 
were still more difficult 
and more than 0.2 mg was too much. When 
0.2 mg MO on DA;He,300”,1 
was further 
pretreated 
H2,400”, 1, 
the 
conversion 
rose from 30 to 60% and H2,500”,1 
led to 
100% hydrogenation.

For 
reference, 
under these conditions, 
Nt per 
Pt, in Pt/SiOz would be about 0.3 sect (15). 
The MO/DA 
catalysts were so active that 
intrusion 
of mass and heat transfer effects 
may have led to some error in I$‘s. 
When propylene 
+ D2 was passed over 
the three catalysts of Fig. 2 at -46”C, 
the 
initial 
product 
of hydrogenation 
was pre- 
dominantly 
C3H6DZ, but hydrogenation 
was 
accompanied 
by formation 
of exchanged 
propylene 
(14). Thus, 
at higher 
conver- 
sions, 
multiply 
exchanged 
propane 
ap- 
peared in the products. However, 
only very 
small amounts of propane with more than 5 
atoms of deuterium 
were detected. 
Appar- 
ently, CD+IDCH, 
is for the most part the 
maximally 
exchanged 
propylene. 
We can- 
not be sure that the exchange of propylene 
did not occur at least in part on the alumina, 
since alumina 
alone is known to effect iso- 
topic exchange between olefins and deute- 
rium (16). 
Isotopic Exchange between Deuterium 
and Cyclopentane (C. Defosse’ 
and M. Laniecki) 
The catalysts activate cyclopentane 
rap- 
idly at 20°C and are among the most active 
known supported 
catalysts for its isotopic 
exchange. 
Monodeuterocyclopentane 
con- 
stitutes

19°C Nt per MO was 0.5 set-’ for DA;He, 
300”,1 or 1.5 set-’ 
per MO,. iVt per MO 
on PDA;He,300”,1 
was 14% as large and 
for 
PDA;Hz,300”,1, 
6%. 
Under 
these 
conditions, 
Nt per Pt, in Pt/SiOz is about 
0.001 see-I. Rhodium 
has about the same 
Nt as MO/DA and that of tungsten is proba- 
bly 
larger. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
activity 
of 
DA;He,300”;H1,650” 
has 
not 
been 
measured. 
The rate of exchange 
of neopentane 
is 
less than 10% that of cyclopentane 
and that 
of methane 
is even slower.

Methane 
is isoelectronic 
with BH4- 
and 
perhaps it is initially 
adsorbed in the same 
fashion. Because of the removal 
of one unit 
of overall negative charge, such a complex 
would be much less stable than the borohy- 
dride complex, 
but one does not seek a 
very 
stable 
intermediate 
for 
a reaction 
which is fast at 19°C. However, 
the inter- 
mediate must be stable enough to form to a 
substantial 
degree. The inductive 
effect of 
alkyl groups should make the complexes 
of 
higher 
alkanes 
more 
stable than that of 
methane, 
but the higher C-H bond energy 
in methane might also contribute 
to its slow 
reaction.

Hydrogenolysis of Cyclopropane 
(R. G. Bowman) 
Most of the pretreatment 
conditions 
lead 
to catalysts which are moderately 
active for 
the hydrogenolysis 
of cyclopropane. 
The 
catalysts belong to the class of Ni (18), Fe, 
Ru, OS (19) which give both single and dou- 
ble hydrogenolyses 
as concurrent 
reactions 
C-C3H6 + H2 + C3Hs 
C-C3H6 + 2Hz * 
C2H6 + CH4 
Although 
rates vary rather little 
with alu- 
mina and pretreatment, 
the fraction of dou- 
ble in single plus double 
hydrogenolysis 
varies from 0.06 for Mo(III-IV) 
to 1 for cat- 
alysts on DA. 
For DA;He,SOO”, 
Z$ per 
MO, was about 0.02 set-’ 
at 0°C. Pt, in Pt/ 
SiOz is 10 times more active, 
although 
it 
catalyzes only single hydrogenolysis 
(1.5). 
Since these materials 
are believed to cat- 
alyze the metathesis 
of olefins by metalla- 
cyclobutane 
intermediates, 
it is tempting 
to 
think that single and double hydrogenolysis 
go by the following 
mechanism.

One must assume that the reaction 2 + 3 is 
relatively 
most rapid vs. reaction 
1 on the 
MO(O) catalysts. 
Yet, these materials 
are 
not good metathesis 
catalysts. 
However, 
slow formation 
of a carbene intermediate 
from propylene 
might be the origin of slow 
metathesis 
on the MO(O) materials. 
Hydrogenation of Carbon Monoxide and 
Carbon Dioxide (R. G. Bowman) 
Both DA and PDA 
and most pretreat- 
ments led to materials 
which converted 
H2 
+ CO (5 : 1, P = 1 atm) to methane 
plus 
some ethane and propane 
at T = 300°C 
(4). 
DA;He,300”,1 
and 
DA;He,300”,1; 
H,,650”,1 
had 
the 
same 
activity, 
Nt 
(300°C) per MO, =0.04 sect’. 
Such activity 
by supported 
metallic 
molybdenum 
is not 
surprising 
since a tungsten 
filament 
has 
been reported 
to be an active catalyst for 
methanation 
(20). Under equivalent 
condi- 
tions, Nt per Ni, is 0.24 set-’ 
(21). Mo(II)/ 
PDA 
(PDA;He,300”, 
1) 
and 
Mo(II1) 
(PDA;H,,300”, 
1) 
provided 
almost 
the 
same value of N,, 0.001 see-*. The condi- 
tions of methanation 
expose a catalyst to 
CO, H20, and H2 at 300°C. Presumably 
the 
Mo(I1) 
and the Mo(II1) 
catalysts come to 
some steady state oxidation 
number 
which 
is a balance between the simultaneous 
oxi- 
dation and reduction 
reactions which must 
be occurring. 
However, 
MO(O) catalysts do 
not approach the same steady state level, at 
least during 1000 min which was our longest 
run. During 
this interval, 
rates are nearly 
constant. 
Apparently, 
the surface layer of 
the MO(O) particles 
becomes 
converted 
to 
some steady state condition, 
but the metal- 
lic core remains 
unconverted. 
DA;He 
or 
H2,300-500” 
are black and change to gray 
at 25°C in air only over several days. These 
catalysts remain 
black during methanation 
at 300°C. 
Little 
carbon 
dioxide 
is formed 
during 
methanation, 
but H2 + COz gives the same 
products 
as H2 + CO and at one-half 
the 
rate. 
Hydrogenolysis 
of Alkanes 
(R. Nakamura 
and R. G. Bowman) 
Mo(O)/DA 
ranks with the most active hy- 
drogenolysis 
catalysts 
known 
(22). How- 
ever, in contrast to methanation, 
only clean 
Mo(O)/DA 
is an active catalyst; 
in fact, as 
shown in Table 
1, hydrogenolysis 
of al- 
kanes is the extreme 
case of reactions for 
which Mo(O)iDA 
is the most active cata- 
lyst. 
Thus, 
with 
DA;He,300”,1 
;H2, Tact,

for the hydrogenolysis 
of 
propane 
at 300°C appeared

steadily 
to T,,, = 
650°C. After 
T,,, = 650-950°C 
N,(25O”C) 
per MO was 0.06 set-l or per MO,, 0.2 set-’ 
(in a flow reactor with a large excess of hy- 
drogen, 
H&H8 
= 26). Both 
single and 
double 
hydrogenolysis 
were observed 
as 
concurrent 
reactions.

The last step is relatively 
slow. 
Single 
hydrogenolysis 
of butane 
leads 
about equally to CH4 + C3Hs and to 2C2H6. 
At 250°C the relative rates of hydrogenoly- 
sis were propane 
0.8, butane (1.00) 
pen- 
tane 
1.4, neopentane 
0.25, cyclopentane 
0.9, and ethane 0.2. There was even less 
divergence 
in the rates at 300°C. 
One may suspect that asking “what is the 
mechanism 
of hydrogenolysis?” 
is apt to be 
unrewarding. 
It is likely 
that a number 
of 
different 
mechanisms 
occur concurrently. 
A number 
of reactions 
are known in or- 
ganometallic 
chemistry, 
the reverses 
of 
which should contribute 
to hydrogenolysis. 
These include, 
the formation 
and fragmen- 
tation of 1,3-diadsorbed 
alkane as at the end 
of the section on cyclopropane, 
the forma- 
tion of 1,4-diadsorbed 
alkane 
and its de- 
composition 
into 
two molecules 
of ad- 
sorbed 
olefin 
(24), 
and a reaction 
like

The experimental 
conditions 
were rather different 
from ours, but it ap-

that the hydrogenolytic 
activi- 
ties of molybdenum 
and ruthenium 
are not

0.044 set-’ 
with E, = 101 kJ mol-’ 
and N, 
for reaction 2 was 0.016 set-’ with E, = 131 
kJ mol-‘. 
The rate declined about 15% dur- 
ing the first hour on stream following 
which 
there was little 
decline 
for several hours. 
Carbonaceous 
deposits were formed during 
hydrogenolysis, 
since 
heating 
in H2 to 
950°C liberated 
CH4 corresponding 
to C/MO 
= 0.05. This C/MO is much smaller 
than 
would correspond 
to complete 
conversion 
to a molybdenum 
carbide. 
Ethane, 
propane, 
and higher hydrocar- 
bons were examined 
in a pulse reactor at 
150-400°C. 
Except 
for ethane, 
single and 
double hydrogenolyses 
were observed and, 
for butane and higher, triple hydrogenolysis 
was also observed to give initial 
products. 
For example, 
on DA;H,,65O”,l 
at 250°C 
neopentane 
underwent 
12% single, 
46% 
double, 
37% triple, 
and 5% quadruple 
hy- 
drogenolysis. 
The last figure is subject to 
substantial 
error, but final cleavage of the

was always found to 
be relatively 
slow. The surface reactions of

Reduction of Mo031PDA to Mo(O)IDA 
(R. Nakamura and D. Pioch) 
Hydrogenolysis 
is very sensitive to poi- 
soning. Pulses of O2 and CO with 02/Mo 
and CO/MO 
not much in excess of unity 
almost completely 
eliminated 
hydrogenoly- 
sis. Even pulses of Nz at 300°C gave sub- 
stantial 
poisoning. 
In all cases the original 
activity 
was restored by H,,950”C, 
0.5. Not 
many 
supported 
catalysts 
would 
survive 
such treatment. 
This resistance 
to loss of 
metal area is probably 
related to the very 
high lattice energy of molybdenum. 
The 
regenerability 
of Mo(O)/DA 
poi- 
soned 
by oxygen 
led us to test PDA; 
He,300”,l;H2,950”,l, 
i.e., 
Mo(2+)/PDA; 
H2,950”. It gave the same activity 
for the 
hydrogenolysis 
of propane 
as Mo(O)/DA. 
This result then required 
us to test Mood 
PDA;H,,950” 
(22). It gave essentially 
the 
same activity 
as Mo(O)/DA 
for the hydro- 
genolysis of propane and the hydrogenation 
of propylene. 
Titration 
of the samples to 
Mo03/A1203 by O2 at 500°C showed that HZ, 
650”,1 
leads 
to 
Mo(I1) 
and 
HZ,800”,1 
gives MO(O). 
Mo03/PDA;H2,9000 
has 
been 
exam- 
ined by dark field electron 
microscopy 
by 
Professor 
M. J. Jacaman. 
He found the 
sample to consist of particles 
of metallic 
molybdenum, 
1 to 4 nm in diameter 
sup- 
ported 
on alumina. 
In the Department 
of 
Materials 
Science at Northwestern 
Univer- 
sity, the material 
was examined 
by EXAFS 
by Messrs. S. Sunshine, 
D. Wilcox, 
and J. 
Watson 
supervised 
by Dr. 
P. 
Georgo- 
poulos. 
After 
H2,900”, 
the material 
con- 
tained metallic 
molybdenum, 
but, after HZ, 
650”, 
it was still 
oxidic. 
Reduction 
to 
MO(O) has been confirmed 
by Peri using in- 
frared absorption 
of adsorbed CO and NO 
as the test (26). 
Mo03/A1203 
has been extensively 
exam- 
ined and with particular 
thoroughness 
by 
W. K. Hall (leading Refs. (27)). In general, 
previous literature 
reports that Mo03/A1203 
cannot be reduced below about 
Mo(IV), 
but 
this 
probably 
really 
means 
not 
below 
Mo(IV) 
in Pyrex apparatus. It would be in- 
teresting to determine 
the catalytic and sur- 
face 
chemical 
relationships 
among 
the 
Mo(CO)dAlzOJ 
catalysts, 
reduced 
Moo31 
PDA, 
variously 
treated 
Mo(m-allyl)d/SiOz, 
and A1203 (28-30) 
and Mo2(n-allyl)&iO1 
and A1203 (31). The last material 
has been 
reported to possess exceptional 
activity 
for 
the hydrogenation 
of olefins. 
Activity 
of W(CO)dA1203 
A few experiments 
have been run with 
W(CO)dA1203. 
The 
surface 
chemistry 
which occurs during activation 
appears to 
be very much like that with Mo(CO)dAlZ03. 
The catalytic 
activity 
is also similar 
for the 
hydrogenation 
of propylene 
and of carbon 
monoxide 
and for the hydrogenolysis 
of cy- 
clopropane. 
It also has activity 
for the me- 
tathesis 
of olefins 
similar 
to that of MO 
(COVA1203 
( 7, 13a). 
ORGANOACTINIDES ON ALUMINA (M.-Y. 
He, R. Nakamura, R. G. Bowman, and 
P. J. Fagan) 
No history is needed here, because, inso- 
far as we are aware, there has been no pre- 
vious 
study of supported 
organoactinide 
complexes. 
Our attention 
was attracted 
to 
this area because the absence of such stud- 
ies provided 
the possibility 
of discovering 
new chemistry 
which might result, in par- 
ticular, 
from the large maximum 
coordina- 
tion number 
of actinide 
atoms. We started 
with the U(CH& 
complex 
shown below on 
alumina. 
The geometry 
of the complex 
is 
roughly tetrahedral 
and the use of the pen- 
tamethylcyclopentadienyl 
anion ligand (Cp, 
one methyl 
is shown above for emphasis) 
310 
ROBERT 
L. BURWELL, 
JR. 
gives a complex 
with only two dienyl 
li- 
gands which is thermally 
stable yet coor- 
dinatively 
unsaturated. 
The complex reacts 
with hydrogen 
in solution 
to give the p- 
bridged dimer shown in the insert above. It 
was thought 
that the steric bulk of the sur- 
face might 
inhibit 
dimer 
formation 
in ad- 
sorbed hydride. 
The complex 
reacts with 
alcohols by protolysis, 
U-CH3 
+ HOCH3 
+ U-0-CH3 
+ CH4 
The u-OH of alumina 
should react similarly 
to bind the complex 
to the surface 
cr-OH + U-CH3 
---, o-0-U 
+ CH4 
although, 
as it turned out, this last reaction 
is a disadvantage. 
The thorium 
complex be- 
haves similarly. 
We examined 
the catalytic activity 
of the 
hydride 
complexes 
in toluene 
solvent 
at 
25°C. For the hydrogenation 
of 1-hexene at 
25°C PH2 = 1 atm, uranium 
hydride 
com- 
plex, N1 = 0.019 set-‘; 
thorium 
hydride 
complex, 
Nt = 0.00015 set-‘. 
Both com- 
plexes exhibited 
only weak activity 
for the 
polymerization 
of ethylene at 25°C 
1 atm. 
We then tested the hydrogenative 
cata- 
lytic activity 
of the U(CH& 
complex which 
was deposited 
on alumina 
from a pentane 
solution by evaporating 
the pentane at 0°C. 
The sample was then pretreated 
at selected 
temperatures 
in helium 
and/or 
hydrogen 
and HZ/propylene 
= 4.7 was passed over 
the catalyst. 
The supported 
catalyst is ex- 
tremely 
sensitive to traces of O2 and H20, 
but even in our first experiments 
we had to 
lower the temperature 
of the catalyst 
to 
-47°C 
to keep the conversion 
under 100% 
(32). Improvements 
in technique 
soon led 
even -47°C to be too high a temperature 
as 
shown in Table 2. Although 
the flow rate 
was steadily increased during the series, we 
were fighting 
a losing 
battle 
against too 
rapid a reaction 
as may be seen from the 
course of the conversion. 
We had learned 
that activity 
increased with temperature 
of 
activation 
in hydrogen 
and that -47°C was 
too high a temperature 
for hydrogenation 
runs. We then lowered the temperature 
to

-63°C 
and after activations 
in hydrogen 
at 
0, 100, and 15O”C, the values of Nt were 
0.58, 0.89, and 0.92 sect’, respectively. 
Rates 
of hydrogenation 
on 
Th(CH3)* 
were nearly the same as on U(CH&. 
PDA 
gave rates which were only a few percent of 
those of DA and silica gel was an even less 
active support than PDA. 
In certain experiments, 
after a hydroge- 
nation 
run at -63”C, 
small pulses of CO 
were injected into flowing He or H2 at 25°C 
and the amount 
of “irreversible” 
adsorp- 
tion (that is, the amount of CO retained by 
the catalyst after a 7-min sweep by the car- 
rier gas) was measured. Amounts 
of CO ad- 
sorbed were small; 
values of CO/M 
were 
only 
about 
2% for 
both 
U(CH3)2 
and 
Th(CH&, 
but rates of subsequent hydroge- 
nation were drastically 
reduced. Where in- 
jection 
of CO was effected 
into 
carrier 
hydrogen, 
the 
low 
subsequent 
rate 
of 
hydrogenation 
at -63°C 
persisted 
for at 
least 2 hr, but for injection 
into carrier he- 
lium, 
the rate rose over 90 min to near its 
original 
value. 
Thus, only about 2% of U and Th had 
become converted 
to active catalytic 
sites. 
Per active site, Nt would be in the vicinity 
of 30-50 set-‘. 
These are very active hy- 
drogenation 
catalysts. For comparison, 
we 
measured 
the rate of hydrogenation 
on a 
Rh/Si02 catalyst (percentage exposed of Rh 
= 60%) prepared 
by ion exchange 
with 
WNHMXU3+ 
and pretreated 
02,300”, 
0.5;H2,3000,1;He,300”,1,

After 
this, 
N1 per Rh, 
for hy- 
drogenation 
at -63°C 
was 28 set-I.

The activations were run in sequence on one batch 
of catalyst. 
although 
the rates are so large that there 
may have been mass and heat transport 
problems, 
it is clear that U(CH&/DA 
and 
Th(CH&/DA 
rank among the most active 
hydrogenation 
catalysts known. 
However, 
they would be behind rhodium 
if activities 
were compared 
on the basis of total micro- 
moles of metal. 
Experiments 
were 
also 
run 
with 
M(CH&/A1203 
to determine 
what gases 
were liberated 
during 
pretreatment 
and 
how much. Yields of methane are given in 
Table 3. No evolution 
of HZ could be de- 
tected. Products 
of reaction 
of the Cp’ li- 
gand appeared in the gas phase only above 
150°C. 
We have investigated 
a number 
of ap- 
proaches to surface characterization, 
How- 
ever, it is not easy to determine 
the identity 
of catalytic 
sites when they amount to only 
a few percents of the surface species. One

M(CD& 
coupled 
with measurement 
of the

+ o-OH led to formation 
of some CD.+ This appears to result from 
M(CD3)2 + o-OH 
--, 
a-OH 
+ M=CD2 
+ CD4 
(C) 
where the “carbene” 
M=CD2 
is probably 
stabilized 
by interaction 
with 
AP+(cus)- 
O*-(cus) ion pairs of the surface in analogy 
to Group IVb carbenes stabilized 
by Al-X 
(34, 35). Results with U(CH& 
are shown in 
Table 4. It is interesting 
that the yield of 
reaction C from U(CHJ)2/DA, 
about 3% of 
total U, is close to that of the fraction of U 
atoms which become active catalytic 
sites. 
The product of reaction C is apparently 
not 
a conventional 
carbene 
since it is a very 
poor catalyst for the metathesis 
of propyl- 
ene. Behavior 
with respect to yields via re- 
actions S, R, and C from Th(CH3)2/DA 
is 
nearly the same as with U(CHJ2/DA.

ROBERT L. BURWELL, 
JR. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
use of PDA 
led to a 
much larger yield of methane by reaction S 
(protolysis). 
Reaction 
S appears 
to be a 
dead-end reaction which leads to the loss of 
potential 
sites. 
Thus, 
activated 
U(CH&/DA 
and Th 
(CH&/DA 
are very active hydrogenation 
catalysts. 
Further, 
we have found that the 
thorium 
hydride dimer shown at the begin- 
ning of this section deposited 
on DA has 
nearly as high an activity 
as these two, but 
the amount of CO adsorption 
needed to poi- 
son hydrogenation 
is larger, about 9% of 
Th. However, 
not all actinide 
complexes 
have 
high 
activity; 
the 
corresponding 
(Cp’),U(CH3)C1 
complex 
supported 
on DA 
had an activity 
of only 2-3% of the others. 
Thorium 
is effectively 
confined to oxida- 
tion number 
+4. Therefore, 
all intermedi- 
ates in the catalytic 
cycle with Th and pre- 
sumably with U complexes 
have O.N. = 4. 
This information 
is important 
mechanisti- 
cally since it eliminates 
the possibility 
of 
reaction via oxidative 
addition 
or reductive 
elimination, 
for example, 
/H 
H2 + Th(IV) 
+ Th(V1) 
and 
\ 
H 
/H 
Th(V1) 
--, Th(IV) 
+ C3Hs 
\ 
C3H7 
We suspect that the final step of the hydro- 
genation will be rather 
H-H 
H 
+I 
M-C3H7 
M + HC3H7 
However, 
these M-C and M-H 
bonds must 
have some special feature, perhaps interac- 
tion with A13+-02-, because most of the M- 
CH3 bonds on the catalyst react only slowly 
with hydrogen 
(Table 3) and we do not yet 
understand 
why. 
Considerable 
further 
work will be needed to establish a reasona- 
bly secure mechanism. 
Polymerization 
of Ethylene 
U(CH3)2/DA 
and Th(CH3)2/DA 
are also 
active catalysts 
for the polymerization 
of 
ethylene 
at 25”C, 1 atm. In these experi- 
ments we passed a series of pulses, CzH4/M 
= 1, over the catalyst 
and measured 
the 
amount 
of ethylene 
in the effluent. For the 
first pulses, adsorption 
was 100%. In some 
cases, the pulse sequence was continued 
until the moles of ethylene 
lost was 40-50 
times as large as the moles of U or Th on 
the catalyst. 
At the termination 
of the se- 
quence, the fraction of each pulse adsorbed 
was still 50-75%. 
The thorium 
hydride 
on 
DA was less active; 
at 25°C after He, 
lOo”,l, 
50% of the first pulse of ethylene 
was adsorbed and the adsorption 
of ethyl- 
ene became zero at the fourteenth 
pulse by 
which time CzHdTh 
had reached 3.6. The 
U(CH3)Cl 
complex 
on DA had only a low 
activity 
for ethylene polymerization. 
CONCLUDING 
REMARKS 
Experiments 
with Mn(CO)$H3 
and Cp 
Fe(CH3)(C0)2 
demonstrate 
the presence of 
adjacent 
A13+(cus) (Lewis 
acid) and 02- 
(Lewis base) sites on PDA and DA. Pure 
silica lacks both types of sites. Clusters of 
platinum 
atoms 1.2-8 nm in diameter 
inter- 
act little with the surfaces of silica or PDA 
and the catalytic 
activities 
of Pt/Si02 
and 
Pt/pure 
Al203 
differ little 
(36). However, 
Mo(CO)dPDA 
and Mo(CO)dpure 
silica be- 
have quite differently. 
Mo(CO)dPDA;He, 
300” and Mo(CO)dDA;He,300” 
give 
ac- 
tive catalysts and little Mo(CO& 
volatilizes 
from the alumina 
during evaporation 
of the 
solvent and subsequent 
heating in flowing 
helium. 
However, 
most of the MOM 
volatilizes 
during 
similar 
treatment 
of 
Mo(CO)&i02. 
Silica has no basic groups 
which can labilize 
Mo(CO& 
via formation 
of (CO)SMO(COB). 
The concentration 
of u-OH 
on alumina 
has a profound 
effect in suitable cases via 
protolysis 
and via oxidation 
of metal atoms. 
Thus, protolysis 
occurs with U(CH3)2 and 
Th(CH3)2 on alumina, 
ORGANOMETALLIC 
COMPLEXES 
ON ALUMINA

M-CH3 
+ o-OH 
+ M-Oa 
+ CH4 
On PDA, protolysis 
is so extensive that lit- 
tle of the complex 
is available 
to form ac- 
tive sites for hydrogenation. 
On DA, how- 
ever, where the concentration 
of V-OH is 
small, very active hydrogenation 
catalysts 
result. Similarly, 
protolysis 
occurs with the 
thorium 
hydride, 
Th-H 
+ o-OH + Th-O-a 
+ H2 
Such protolytic 
reactions 
of o-OH 
are old 
particularly 
in connection 
with the libera- 
tion of propylene 
from M(allyl), 
on silica or 
alumina. 
In the oxidative 
reaction 
of o-OH, 
the 
metal atom or ion is oxidized. 
In the case of 
MOM, 
MO reacts after loss of CO 
[MO] + 2a-OH 
+ Mo2+ + 2~-O- 
+ H2 
and some of the hydrogen is diverted to re- 
duction 
of Mo-CO 
to CH4. Thus, metallic 
molybdenum 
does not result from heating 
Mo(CO)dPDA 
in helium 
to 300-500°C. 
Rather, 
surface Mo2+-Mo6+ 
are formed 
in 
an average oxidation 
number 
which varies 
from about +2 near 280°C to almost 
+6 at 
500°C. With DA, these reactions are largely 
suppressed 
and 
metallic 
molybdenum 
results. 
Finally, 
if Mo2+/PDA 
or Mo03/HA 
is 
heated in hydrogen 
to about 95o”C, dehy- 
droxylation 
of the alumina 
and reduction 
of 
the MO”+ both occur to produce 
metallic 
molybdenum 
supported 
on DA.
