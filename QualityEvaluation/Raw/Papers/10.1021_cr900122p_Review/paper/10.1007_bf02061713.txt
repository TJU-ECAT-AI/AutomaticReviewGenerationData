Pyridine 
(py) and acetic acid (Ac) adsorption on dealu- 
minated HY zeolites with A1 content in the range of 3.9- 
58 per unit cell (U.C.) was studied at 553 K by a flow- 
gravimetric technique. The ratio of the number of ad- 
sorbed py and Ac molecules to the number of A1 atoms 
was plotted as a function of the A1 content. The plot 
passes through a maximum for py and a minimum for Ac. 
The extrema are at about 30 AI/U.C.

INTRODUCTION 
A great number of papers has been devoted recently to the 
acidity of zeolites 
[1,2]. In contrast to acidic properties, 
much less attention has been paid to basicity 
[3,4]. The acidi- 
ty of zeolites depends, among others, on the number and density 
of acid sites. The number of acid sites equals theoretically

the number of A1 atoms in the zeolite structure. Our work is 
aimed at finding a correlation between the A1 content and the 
average acid as well as the base strength of the sites in HY 
zeolites dealuminated to different degrees. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Zeolite samples were obtained by courtesy of Dr. H.K. 
Beyer. They were prepared from NaY zeolite by dealumination with 
then ion-exchanged for NH~ [5]. A1 contents of the sam- 
SiC14 
, 
ples are shown in Table i. 
The flow-gravimetric technique [6] was used to measure the 
adsorption of py and Ac. 200 mg of zeolite was pretreated at 
673 K in helium stream until constant weight was reached, then 
adsorption and desorption measurements were carried out at 
553 K. The first sample was contacted with helium saturated 
with the adsorptive at 293 K. When the increase of the sample- 
weight ceased, weakly bound adsorbate was eluted with helium 
for 1 h. Close to the end of this period, the weight decrease 
became very slow. The amount of adsorbate retained by the sam- 
ple was considered as the "strongly bound" part of the total 
adsorbed amount.

RESULTS 
The amount of py and Ac strongly bound on HY zeolites at 
553 K can be seen in Table i. The adsorbed amount of both ad- 
sorbates is lower on zeolites containing less AI. However, if 
the number of adsorbate molecules related to the number of A1 
atoms is plotted as a function of the A1 content (Fig. I) 
curves show different characteristics for py and Ac. The curve 
for py goes through a maximum and that for Ac through a mini- 
mum 
with extrema at about 30 Al-atoms/U.C.

DISCUSSION 
The acid strength of sites in zeolites depends on the Si/AI 
ratio. The cluster model provides an explanation for the varia- 
tion of the acid strength. According to the mode~ due to short 
range interactions the protonic acidity associated with an AIO; 
tetrahedron depends on the number of close A1 neighbors of the 
tetrahedron 
[i]. Another model applies the Sanderson electroneg- 
ativity equalization concept [7]. This model suggests that for 
faujasites of various A1 contents the charge on the protons, 
i.e. 
the acid strength of the Br~nsted-acid sites increases con- 
?9 
SZANYI et al. : DEALUMINATED ZEOLITES 
tinuously as the A1 content decreases 
[8]. 
When the A1 concentration is very small, short-range in- 
teractions are negligible. After a critical Si/AI ratio the 
acid strength is supposed to become independent of the degree 
of dealumination. 
For faujasite, the highest and constant acid 
strength region is predicted to be reached at Al-contents 
smaller than 28-30 AI/U.C. 
[2]. 
We characterized the average acid strength of the sites 
by the average number of py molecules strongly bound on a site 
under fixed conditions. The results indicate that this value 
decreases if the A1 content decreases below 30 AI/U.C. One ex- 
planation for this unusual phenomenon may be that A1 atoms 
which can be less easily removed by a SiC14 treatment, are less 
accessible for py. 
Infrared spectroscopic studies of adsorbed py verified 
that OH groups in close proximity of A1 atoms show the proper- 
ties of Br~nsted type acid centers, however, in interaction 
with organic acid molecules the same sites exhibit the proper- 
ties of a Br~nsted basic center 
[3]. Acetate ions are formed as 
a result of the reaction between the zeolitic OH groups and the 
adsorbed Ac molecules. 
It has been shown by pyrrole adsorption measurements that 
while the acidity of zeolites in different cationic forms de- 
creases 
(in the sequence of Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs) their basic- 
ity increases 
[4]. Zeolites in Na or K form have amphoteric 
properties. 
Our results snow that the number of adsorbed Ac molecules 
related to the number of A1 atoms varies according to an oppo- 
site trend with the A1 content of the zeolite as the number of 
adsorbed py. This strongly suggests that the acid strength of 
the sites decreases and, concomitantly, 
their base strength in- 
creases if the A1 content of the HY zeolite decreases in the 
range of 30 to O AI/U.C. Nevertheless, 
it does not seem proba- 
ble that although some of the sites are less accessible for py, 
other sites are more accessible for Ac. Further examinations 
are planned to find an explanation for the unexpected acid-base 
properties of the deeply dealuminated fau]asites.
