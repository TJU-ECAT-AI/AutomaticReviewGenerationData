Silica-supported 
tantalum hydride activates at low temperature the C-H and the C-D bonds of cyclooctane 
and CD4, 
respectively, to form the corresponding cyclooctyl and perdeuteriomethyl-tantalum surface complexes; these 
complexes are transformed under molecular oxygen into the corresponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives which with 
acetic acid give rise to the corresponding alkylacetates. 
The valorisation of methane and higher alkanes still constitutes 
a major scientific challenge. In the field of classical organome- 
tallic chemistry, numerous complexes of transition metals of 
Groups 3-5, lanthanides and actinides have been reported to 
activate the C-H 
bond of methane, higher alkanes and 
aromatics. These highly electrophilic complexes with a do 
configuration are commonly believed to activate the C-H bond 
of alkanes by a cr-bond metathesis me~hanism.l~.~J 
Recently, 
we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic 
chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely 
(-SiO)sZr-H 
with a do configuration, was able to activate 
stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 
and 120 O
C
,
 respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium- 
alkyls.4.5 The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium 
analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature 
hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, 
isobutane or neopentane.5.6.7 The unexpected high activity of 
these surface organometallic fragments in catalytic conditions 
which usually require much higher temperatures in classical 
heterogeneous catalysis, has been ascribed to the high electro- 
philic character of these metals which are formally eight 
electron species, associated with the immobilisation and 
isolation of the zirconium centres which prevent dimerisation or 
more generally deactivation. 
We have therefore tried to see if other silica-supported early 
transition metal hydrides could lead to similar types of C-H 
bond activation, one of the objectives being a possible 
functionalisation after activation. We report here that a silica- 
supported tantalum-hydride is also able to activate cyclooctane 
and methane to form the corresponding tantalum-alkyl surface 
species. We also demonstrate that these surface tantalum-alkyls 
can be transformed under molecular oxygen into the corre- 
sponding tantalum-alkoxy derivatives which with acetic acid 
gives the corresponding alkylacetates. 
We have recently reported that the reaction of the trisneo- 
pentyl(neopenty1idene)tantalum 
complex 
Ta(-CH2- 
CMe3)3(=CH-CMe3)* 
1 with the silanol groups of a silica 
previously dehydroxylated at 500 "C (silica5m), leads to the 
formation 
of 
two 
surface 
species: 
=SiO-Ta(-CH2- 
CTV%~~)~(=CH-CM~~) 
2a (ca. 65%) and (zSi0)2Ta(-CH2- 
CMe3)(=CH-CMe3) 2b (ca. 35%), with liberation of neopent- 
ane.? These two grafted complexes have been characterized by 
elemental analysis, chemical reactivity with D20 and acetone 
(pseudo-Wittig 
reaction) and by FT-IR and 13C 
CP-MAS NMR 
spectroscopies.9 
When 2a and 2b are treated under hydrogen (1 atm; 150 "C 
for 15 h), supported tantalum-hydride [Ta],-H 3 is formed, 
characterized 
by an IR band at v 1830 
and shoulders at 18 
15 
and 
1855 cm- 1 [Fig. 1 
(a)]. Simultaneously, neopentane is evolved 
in the gas phase as well as methane, ethane, propane and 
isobutane resulting either from a partial hydrogenolysis of the 
neopentyl or neopentylidene ligands or more likely from the 
hydrogenolysis of the neopentane released during the hydro- 
genolysis of these hydrocarbyl ligands. 
Complex 3 exchanges reversibly with deuterium at room 
temperature as evidenced by the reversible shift under D2 and 
then H2 of the three IR bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1. 
Complex 3 reacts with water to liberate hydrogen and with Me1 
to form CH4. Although full characterization of 3 is still in 
progress, it seems that an eight electron TaIII monohydride 
(=Si0)2Ta(H) linked to the silica surface by two siloxy 
fragments is the major (if not unique) component.$ 
Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a 
vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl 
surface complex 4 [eqn. (l)]. Evidence for reaction (1) is as 
[TaIs-H + cyclo-C8H16 
+ 
[Ta]s-cyclo-C~HI5 
+ H2 (1) 
follows: (a) 
after gas phase evacuation, IR bands at 2929,2857 
[v(CH2)] 
and 1477,1468,1448 
cm-l[6(CH2)] characteristic of 
methylene groups appear on the silica disc [Fig. l(b)]; these 
bands are resistant to prolonged evacuation at room temp. under 
which conditions physisorbed cyclooctane is removed (inde- 
pendent experiment). Simultaneously, the intensity of the I
R
 
bands at 1815, 1830 and 1855 cm-1 decreases; (6) 
the reaction 
produces molecular hydrogen as evidenced by GC; (c) introduc- 
tion of water vapour on the surface complex 4, resulting from 
the reaction of 3 with cyclooctane, 
liberates cyclooctane and the 
IR bands corresponding 
to v(CH2), and 6(CH2) vibration modes 
disappear [Fig. l(c)]; (

)
 
after introduction of dry 
oxygen (200 
tom; 25 "C) on the presumed tantalum-cyclooctyl species 4, a 
new surface complex is formed which is resistant to hydrolysis; 
further introduction of a vapour of acetic acid (1 
5 ton) liberates 
cyclooctyl-acetate as a major product; this demonstrates that 
oxygen has been inserted into the Ta-C bond, probably via a 
peroxo intermediate as known in molecular chemistry,lo 
to form

To our knowledge, this is the first example of an 
intermol- 
ecular alkane activation on a supported tantalum hydride. 
Photolytic or thermal reaction of benzene with (q5-C5H5)Ta- 
(Me)(PMe3) 
has already been reported;l2 an oxidative addition 
of benzene was assumed but the presence of (But)2SiH2 proved 
to be necessary; the role of the silane was to favour the 
liberation of methane before the activation of benzene; 
( B u ~ ) ~ S ~ H ~  
also induced the exchange of the phenyl group with 
C6D6 on the obtained complex. Thermal or photochemical 
reaction of (q5-C5H&Ta(H)3 with hydrosilanes R3SiH has also 
been reported.13J4 In the case of PhMe2SiH only the sym- 
metrical adduct (q5-C5H5)Ta(H)SiMe2Ph(H) 
supported by an 
X-ray structure determination was obtained;l3 the other isomers 
( T ~ - C ~ H ~ ) T ~ ( H > ~ ( S ~ R , )  
with the silyl group in the lateral 
position were also observed as minor components in the case of 
SiH4, MeSiH3, 
Me2SiH2, 
Me3SiH, 
Me2SiHC1 
or (Me0)3SiH.I4 
In both case, hydrogen was assumed to be released before the 
oxidative addition of the silane. 
This kind of mechanism differs from that which is usually 
mentioned in the case of early transition metals, lanthanides 
or actinides, for which a a-bond metathesis process is 
invoked.le.233 In the present case of supported tantalum- 
hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond 
metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface 
after alkane activation [eqn. (5)]. 
However, we cannot yet

exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a 
tantalum(II1) surface species followed by an elimination of 
hydrogen [eqn. (ti)]. Some results in the case of niobium have

shown that the electron attractive substituent SiMe3 on the 
cyclopentadienyl ligands makes the hydrogen more labile in the 
[(q5-C5H3)SiMe&NbH3 
complex than in (q5-C5H5)2Nb(H)3. 
l5 
In the same way, the presence of siloxy ligands coordinated to 
tantalum instead of the cyclopentadienyl ligands should make 
the metal far more electrophilic and may favour the departure of 
hydrogen. 
Moreover, the present supported 
tantalum-hydride [Tals-H 3 
proves to be far more active towards C-H bond activation than 
the corresponding molecular complexes; indeed, complex 3 
reacts spontaneously at room temperature with cyclooctane 
whereas irradiation or heating to 100 "C are required to form the 
corresponding molecular Ta-alkyl or -silyl complexes. This is 
probably due to the direct grafting of tantalum on silica which 
results (a) 
in the formation of Si-O-Ta bonds which will make 
the tantalum very electrophilic, (b) in the isolation of the 
metallic centres and (c) in the stabilisation of highly co- 
ordinatively unsaturated species, all parameters which are 
difficult to govern in solution. 
The subsequent oxidation step illustrates the possibility of 
selectively introducing an oxygen atom into the alkane 
molecule.

was prepared according to a published 
procedure;8 it was sublimed under vacuum (80 "C, 10-4 torr) on freshly 
dehydroxylated (500 "C, 15 h, 
torr) silica (Aerosil Degussa, 200 
m2 g-l) according to break and seal techniques; unreacted complex was 
removed by evacuation at the same temperature. The solid samples thus 
obtained were ca. 5 mass% Ta. All further reactants were carefully dried 
over freshly regenerated molecular sieves and when necessary deoxygen- 
ated over deoxo traps. The IR spectra were recorded from a glass cell with 
CaF2 windows, on a FT-IR Nicolet 550 spectrometer. Gas phases were 
analysed by GC.
