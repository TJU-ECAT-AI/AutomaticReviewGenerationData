Abstract
The activity in alkane metathesis of tungsten complexes grafted on gamma alumina raises many questions regarding the structure of the active
site and the reaction pathways. We examine the case of a perhydrocarbyl tungsten complex on alumina from periodic density functional theory
calculations. The quantum chemistry exploration of energy pathways suggests two possible mechanisms for alkane metathesis. The ﬁrst mecha-
nism occurs on the grafted complex only but is signiﬁcantly activated. The second mechanism shows that hydration defects on the alumina surface
can be active in alkane dehydrogenation toward alkenes, whereas the tungsten complex efﬁciently catalyzes the subsequent oleﬁn metathesis step.
The calculations thus underscore the role of the alumina support in the mechanism.

1. Introduction
The valorization of alkanes represents an important chal-
lenge, especially in terms of the capability to selectively form
longer or shorter alkanes chains to optimize their proper-
ties as fuel. In this respect, alkane metathesis is a reaction
with signiﬁcant potential applicability. Such a reaction has
been approached by homogeneous and heterogeneous cataly-
sis [1–3]. At the midpoint between these two methods, surface
organometallic chemistry offers an innovative approach and has
proven its efﬁciency in alkane metathesis with Ta, Mo, or W
complexes grafted onto silica or alumina [4–12]. This chem-
istry is constructed with the tools of homogeneous catalysis
brought to their limits, with the oxide surface considered as a
ligand [13].
Besides the choice of the metal complex, the nature of the
oxide support also may play a decisive role in the reactiv-
ity thus obtained. This is especially so when a surface such
as γ -Al2O3, with its partial hydroxylation and its rich acid–

base chemical properties, is used. The development of tung-
sten-based heterogeneous alkane metathesis catalysts from a
surface organometallic chemistry approach has indeed uncov-
ered some support effects that remain unexplained [10]. Graft-
ing [W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] onto SiO2 or γ -Al2O3 after partial
dehydroxylation at 500 ◦C leads to well-characterized neutral
mono-siloxy (SisO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 and mono-aluminoxy
(AlsO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 complexes, respectively, where Sis
and Als represent surface silicium and aluminum atoms. The
complex grafted onto alumina is active in propane metathesis
(turnover number [TON] = 28), whereas that grafted onto sil-
ica is not (TON = 0) [10,13,14]. Recently, it was shown that a
silica–alumina support, treated under similar conditions, yields
a very similar surface complex as silica, with grafting onto the
Si atom (SisO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 but, surprisingly, gives a
propane metathesis reactivity similar to that on the alumina sup-
port [15]. The inﬂuence of the support thus seems especially
confused. In addition, it has been proposed that, as for grafted
tantalum complexes, in alkane metathesis oleﬁn metathesis is
the key homologation process, because oleﬁns have been iden-
tiﬁed as primary products, and the ratios of products of cross-
metathesis between various alkanes are in agreement with those
of the corresponding oleﬁn metathesis [5–10]. All surface tung-

sten complexes, including those grafted on silica, are indeed
active in oleﬁn metathesis. However, the mechanism for the
initial alkane dehydrogenation step to form the oleﬁn and the
differences between the oxide supports are not yet clearly un-
derstood. Thus, probing the support reactivity at a molecular
level, together with that of the grafted complex, is of primary
importance to improve such chemistry and can lead to a new
interpretation of the numerous phenomena occurring when us-
ing alumina as a catalyst support.
Density functional theory (DFT) applied to periodic cal-
culations has proven to be a useful tool in a comprehensive
approach of γ -Al2O3 reactivity toward H2O, H2, alkane, metal-
lic clusters, and various organometallic complexes [14,16–18].
The aim of the present work was to use a quantum mechan-
ical approach in the DFT framework to gain insight into the
role of this oxide when used as a support for perhydrocarbyl
tungsten complexes in the catalysis of alkane metathesis. We
compared possible mechanisms for alkane metathesis catalyzed
by [(AlsO)W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], to identify and differentiate
the inﬂuences of the complex and of the support, γ -Al2O3 [14].
2. Methods
We performed the calculations in a DFT framework with the
PW91 functional using a periodic description of the system as
implemented in the VASP code [19–21]. The atomic cores were
described with the projected augmented wave (PAW) technique
with an energy cutoff of 275 eV [22,23]. Minimum energy path-
ways were found using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method
with eight equally spaced images along the pathway [24]. The
transition state structures were fully optimized and character-
ized by a single negative force constant along the reaction path-
way.
The surface was modeled by a four-layer slab. The inﬂu-
ence of slab thickness has been evaluated for up to eight layers,
with no signiﬁcant change noted [16]. The two bottom lay-
ers of the slab were maintained in the geometry of the bulk,
whereas the two upper layers were relaxed. With such an asym-
metric representation of the surface, some dipole corrections
may be necessary. Tests revealed only inﬁnitesimal changes in
geometries and energetic corrections below 5 kJ mol−1, con-
gruent with the large vacuum zone between the slabs (≈17 Å).
Thus, such corrections were not applied. Moreover, zero point
energy corrections were not systematically taken into account.
Indeed, testing demonstrated that these corrections never ex-
ceeded 10–15 kJ mol−1 in favor of the species including fewer
C–H bonds.
3. Results and discussion
The model used for the γ -alumina bulk results from a study
investigating the dehydration of boehmite by determining the
optimal distribution of 25% tetrahedral and 75% octahedral Al
in a fcc lattice of O atoms [25]. This model is in good agreement
with the measured bulk modulus and X-ray diffraction spectra.
The (110) surface of γ -alumina, the most exposed surface in
the particles (75%), is described here by a four-layer periodic
slab of unit formula Al16O24 with cell vectors of 8.4 × 8.1 Å2
[26–28]. The bare (110) surface unit cell exhibits several acces-
sible unsaturated Al atoms, one tricoordinated from a tetrahe-
dral Al in the bulk and three tetracoordinated from bulk octahe-
dral atoms.
The surface can be hydrated by successive adsorption of
water molecules. The simulation of IR spectra shows that the
trihydrated surface unit cell with a OH coverage of 7.3 OH/nm2
(vs 4 OH/nm2 determined experimentally) correctly describes
the diversity of OH groups present on γ -Al2O3 pretreated at
500 ◦C [26–28]. However, the hydration of alumina is not uni-
form, and adsorption of methane and H2 through a combined
experimental and theoretical approach has shown that dehy-
drated tricoordinated Al centers are present as strong Lewis
acid site defects (∼0.04 site/nm2) and have a strong Lewis acid
character [16]. The periodic description of such a low concen-
tration of defects would require a huge unit cell. Instead, we
modeled the dehydrated defects separately by the nonhydrated
γ -Al2O3 unit cell.
The W complex is grafted on the hydroxylated alumina sur-
face. It was shown previously by a mechanistic simulation that
the grafting occurs by a σ-bond metathesis reaction involving a
surface OH group on a tetrahedral Al atom and the W–CH2tBu
bond, with the formation of a neutral mono-aluminoxy com-
plex (1) and the release of a neopentane molecule [14]. Further
elimination involving neighboring OH groups to give a bis-
aluminoxy surface complex is activated (barrier, 100 kJ mol−1)
from geometric constraints; however, this transformation could
occur at the temperature of the alkane metathesis reaction
(150 ◦C). Calculations have shown that this bis-aluminoxy sur-
face complex has very similar reactivity to the mono-aluminoxy
surface complex, and thus here we limit the presentation to the
latter. The mono-aluminoxy complex (1) has been further vali-
dated by the simulation and complete interpretation of the 13C
NMR and IR spectra [14]. Its calculated structure, which is in
excellent agreement with the EXAFS data [10], is shown in
Fig. 1b with model ligands (methyl instead of neopentyl and
CCH3 instead of CtBu). Together, the total energy, the compar-
ison with EXAFS, and the spectra calculations demonstrate that
this structure is a realistic model of the surface organometallic
site, and we explore its reactivity in the present work.
The simplest way to approach the mechanism, used up to
now, is to consider that all of the elementary steps occur on the
tungsten complex, with no chemistry on the alumina (Fig. 1a).
This mechanism starts from propane and complex 1 (Fig. 1b) as
a model of the catalyst [14]. We have studied this mechanism
up to the formation of the metallacycle 4, with the subsequent
steps being the reverse of those leading to 4 with exchange of
the substituents. The energy proﬁle is given in Fig. 1c.
The activation of propane on the complex can occur by C–H/
W–C σ-bond metathesis (reaction energy, E = 9 kJmol−1;
activation energy, E‡ = 140 kJmol−1) or by addition of a
C–H bond of propane on the carbyne ligand (E = 52 kJmol−1
and E‡ = 110 kJmol−1). From this second product, no path-
way with reasonable barriers was found for subsequent reac-
tion steps (β-H elimination or α-H abstraction), and thus only
the product 2 of the C–H/W–C σ-bond metathesis will be

considered further. This can undergo β-H abstraction by the
nucleophilic carbyne, giving a carbene 3 (E = 3 kJmol−1
and E‡ = 102 kJmol−1) and a coordinated oleﬁn on WIV,
which also can be viewed as a metallacyclopropane of WVI,
510

with the strong pyramidalization of the carbon atoms and the
distance between the two carbon atoms (1.46 Å) in 3 favor-
ing the latter description. Formation of metallacyclobutane,
the central intermediate for the oleﬁn metathesis reaction, can
then occur, yielding the d2 complex 4 (E = 55 kJmol−1 and
E‡ = 130 kJmol−1), for which the triplet state is more stable
than the singlet state (ET-S = −34 kJmol−1).
The decoordination of the oleﬁn from 3 is calculated to
be endothermic by E = 184 kJmol−1, which is too high to
account for the experimental detection of oleﬁns as primary
products. In addition, the activation energies in this process are
rather high; the highest transition state along the pathway is
142 kJ mol−1 above the reactant state. The entropic effects from
translational and rotational degrees of freedom in gas phase can
be included to simulate the free energy at 150 ◦C. The free en-
ergy barrier between 1 and 2 is 200 kJ mol−1 (because both
propane and methane are immobilized in the transition state),
and the metallacyclobutane 4 is 92 kJ mol−1 less stable than
the reactants. Thus, direct activation of the alkane on the sur-
face tungsten complex seems difﬁcult, at least from the energy
pathways explored here.
The previous conclusion and the different reactivity for the
silica and alumina (or silica–alumina) support lead us to con-
sider other mechanisms, including direct participation of the
oxide surface in the reactivity. As explained above, the γ -Al2O3
surface shows a small fraction of totally dehydrated and reactive
tricoordinated aluminum atoms (see structure 5 in Fig. 2a) [16].
The C–H bonds of propane can react with such tricoordi-
nated aluminum atoms to give a hydroxyl group and an alkyl-
aluminum (structure 6) on the surface by addition of C–H on a
Al–O bond (E = −127 kJmol−1 and E‡ ≈25 kJmol−1),
as observed previously with methane both experimentally and
theoretically [16]. Starting from this alkyl-aluminum, propene
can be obtained by β-H elimination (E = 127 kJmol−1 and
E‡ = 140 kJmol−1). The reaction forms an aluminum hy-
dride and a hydroxyl group with the same characteristics as
that obtained by dissociation of H2 on such a defect site (see
structure 7 in Fig. 2). The overall process (C–H addition and
β-H elimination) is iso-energetic and corresponds to a dehydro-
genation of propane with the stabilization of H2 on the surface
by its dissociation on strong Lewis acid sites (see the energy
proﬁle in Fig. 3c). Including entropic effects in the gas phase,
the barrier to activating propane on the dehydrated defect in-
creases to 105 kJ mol−1, a reasonable value for a reaction at
150 ◦C, whereas the intermediate structure 6 is stabilized only
by G = −47 kJmol−1 with respect to gas-phase propane. The
overall process remains thermoneutral (G = +2 kJmol−1),
because the number of molecules in the gas phase is conserved.
Zero point energy corrections stabilize the ﬁnal state 7 slightly,
by 15 kJ mol−1.
Another possible route to dehydrogenated propane on such
a defect site is through a concerted reaction via a six-member
ring transition state. In this transition state, the two hydrogen
atoms are transferred to the surface, one on an oxygen atom, the
other on the AlIII atom. Because the transfer of the hydride on
the aluminum atom is largely advanced in the transition state,
this one looks like a carbocation, and the more it is substituted,

the more stable it is, as can be seen from the values reported
in Fig. 2b for the two isomers of the transition state, which dif-
fer by 25 kJ mol−1. However, the activation barrier (E‡ =
127 kJmol−1) is higher than for the stepwise process, espe-
cially if entropic effects are estimated (G‡ = 207 kJmol−1).
Thus, the two-step mechanism with the proton-alkyl intermedi-
ate is favored. This demonstrates the possible role of the alu-
mina surface in generating primary products. To the best of our
knowledge, such activity of γ -alumina for the propane dehy-
drogenation step has not yet been pointed out. Note, however,

that this dehydrogenation reaction is stoichiometric and not cat-
alytic, where the number of propene molecules produced is less
than the number of hydration defects on the alumina support.
In parallel to the oleﬁn formation on the alumina low coor-
dination sites, the carbyne complex 1 can isomerize in a bis-
carbene structure 8 represented in Fig. 3b (E = 24 kJmol−1
and E‡ = 56 kJmol−1), a well known process for analo-
gous complexes [29,30]. Thus, every element is present to pro-
duce a metallacyclobutane: propene and carbene 8. No precur-
sor state has been identiﬁed: the metallacycle 9 (Fig. 3b) is
512

formed without coordination of the oleﬁn before ring closure
(E = −5 kJmol−1 and E‡ = 38 kJmol−1).
The reaction energy to form the metallacycle 9, a d0 complex
of W(VI), is 24 kJ mol−1 more favorable than that for forming
the d2 metallacycle of W(IV) 4 in its triplet state. This feature
is a key aspect in the comparison between the two mechanisms;
the transition state leading to 4 is higher than that leading to 9,
because it requires a change in the oxidation state of the tung-
sten atom from +VI to +IV with a spin transition. These elec-
tronic changes are not necessary in the mechanism leading to 9.
The ring opening of 9 will form butene, which can be hy-
drogenated in an approximately thermoneutral process by the
reverse reaction of the dehydrogenation presented above in the
case of propane/propene (Fig. 2). The complete catalytic cycle
is presented in Fig. 3a. This dual mechanism forms the oleﬁn
on the alumina defects and clearly explains its detection as
a primary product. Oleﬁn metathesis then occurs on the sup-
ported W complex, whereas the new alkane is regenerated by
backward hydrogenation on the aluminum hydride–hydroxyl
couple (7) previously formed on alumina. The thermoneutral
nature of the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction on the
tricoordinated Al atom plays an important role here. The new
bis-carbene 8eq can again coordinate propene to form the met-
allacycle 9eq (similar to the 8 →9 reaction). Thus, metathesis
regenerates the initial site 8 and produces ethene which can be
hydrogenated on alumina.
4. Conclusion
The quantum chemistry exploration of energy pathways sug-
gests two possible mechanisms for alkane metathesis. The ﬁrst
one takes place on the grafted complex only. It activates the
propane by σ-bond metathesis, forms a carbene–oleﬁn complex
by β-H abstraction, and ﬁnally transforms it to a d2 metallacy-
cle. This mechanism presents an overall barrier of 140 kJ mol−1
in energy and ∼200 kJ mol−1 in free energy and is hence sig-
niﬁcantly activated. Moreover, the production of propene, seen
as a primary product in the experiment cannot be accounted. It
cannot be excluded however that the well-characterized grafted
complex is not the ﬁnal active site but is instead a precursor of
the catalyst, which structure would still be unknown.
The second mechanism is based on the demonstrated exis-
tence of a small amount of dehydrated defects (0.04 per nm2)
on γ -alumina (pretreated at 500 ◦C) able to react with a C–H
bond of an alkane [16]. Propane can be dehydrogenated on such
defect sites, stoichiometrically forming propene, an aluminum
hydride and a hydroxyl group. The maximum barrier in this
process is 127–140 kJ mol−1, in energy and also in free energy,
and the reaction is thermoneutral. The amount of oleﬁn formed
is linked to the number of low-coordination Al sites. Oleﬁn
metathesis is then performed in a second step by the grafted
tungsten–alkyl complex, in a mechanism with small barriers.
The oleﬁns thus formed (butene and ethene) can then react
again with the proton-hydride site in a process that is the reverse
of the initial propane activation process, to generate butane and
ethane. The overall reaction cycle is catalytic, because the stoi-
chiometric reaction is performed twice, once forward and once
backward. This mechanism is appealing due to its reasonable
free energy barrier, which leads to a favorable exponential term
in the rate. However, the prefactor is reduced from the small
number of active sites on alumina. In addition, this mechanism
agrees with the initial formation of propene in the experiment.
This mechanism implying the support could naturally ex-
plain why the same complex grafted on silica is inactive in
alkane metathesis. Silica does not have defect sites with strong
Lewis acidity and cannot activate alkanes as alumina can. The
silica–alumina support, which gives an active complex, also is
interesting. The tungsten is grafted by a siloxy linkage, as on
silica, and thus its activity in this case is not expected. In con-
trast, three-fold coordinated Al defects also should be present
on silica–alumina, presumably in larger amounts than on alu-
mina, because aluminum is mostly in a tetrahedral environment
in silica–alumina bulk. Thus, the dual mechanism implying
support to activate the alkane also should be possible on this
support. The activation of methane on silica–alumina should be
tested experimentally to conﬁrm this hypothesis.
The dehydrated defects on γ -alumina are certainly fragile
entities. They can react with traces of water or with oleﬁns,
forming oligomers. This could explain the rapid catalyst de-
activation. An experiment designed to selectively remove these
sites before alkane metathesis would provide proof of their par-
ticipation in that reaction, as proposed herein.
Quantum simulations can provide important insight on the
reaction mechanism for surface organometallic chemistry, un-
derscoring the complementarity of the reactivity of the grafted
complex and that of the oxide support itself. This intimate du-
ality, at the molecular level, is a clear advantage, enabling the
design of innovative catalysts.
