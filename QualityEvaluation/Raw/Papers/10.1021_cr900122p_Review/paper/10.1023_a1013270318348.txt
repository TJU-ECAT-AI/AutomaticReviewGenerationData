Abstract
This paper presents the first observation of the broad-range NIR DRIFT spectrum of CH4 adsorbed on HM zeolite including different combinations of C–H bending and stretching vibrations and overtones of those vibrations. The obtained results indicate that adsorption of methane results in the strongest perturbation of the combinations of ν2 and ν4 C–H bending frequencies with each other and with the ν3 asymmetric stretching frequency. Therefore, it is suggested that those combinations could be used as a better index of methane perturbation and of the reaction coordinate of methane protolytic dehydrogenation than the fundamental frequencies commonly used for this purpose.
