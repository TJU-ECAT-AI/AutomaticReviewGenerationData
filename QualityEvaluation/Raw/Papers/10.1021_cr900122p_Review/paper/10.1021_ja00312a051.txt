Discussion 
The synthetic chemistry presented here offers straightforward, 
general routes to a broad family of ether- and halide-free bis- 
(pentamethylcyclopentadieny1)lanthanide 
alkyls and hydrides. The 
hydrides are of course greatly desirable synthetic targets for 
catalytic studies but are equally valuable precursors for numerous 
types of ether- and halide-free lanthanide hydrocarbyls and other 
derivatives4 One result of this work is thus a readily accessible, 
homologous series of tractable, thermally stable, very electrophilic 
(for which there is structural evidence), and very highly reactive 
lanthanide alkyl/hydride pairs which span the 4f block from the 
lightest (4P) 
to the heaviest member (4fI4). In 
chemistry involving 
olefins, significant reactivity differences are 
observed between light 
(La, Nd) and heavy (Lu) lanthanides. For example, the light 
members appear to be the most active “homogeneous” ethylene 
polymerization catalysts prepared to date. For bulkier olefins, 
allylic C-H activation and q3-allyl formation are found to compete

Abstract: This contribution discusses lanthanide hydrocarbyl and hydride chemistry based upon Me,SiCp”, supporting ligation 
(Cp” = q5-(CH3),C5). The reaction of MC13, M = Nd, Sm, or Lu, with Me,si(C~”Li)~ 
yields the precursor complexes 
Me2SiCp”2MC1<Li(ether)2+. 
A slightly different workup procedure yielded (Me2SiCp”2NdC1)2C1-Li(THF)2+, 
which crystallizes 
in the monoclinic space group P2/n with two molecules in a unit cell of dimensions (-133 ‘C) a = 11.666 (3) A, b = 12.585 
(3) A, c = 17.765 (6) A, and p = 94.91 (2)’. Least-squares refinement led to a value for the conventional R index (on F) 
of 0.045 for 3231 independent reflections having Z 
Z 3 4 0 .  The structure consists of two Me2Si(q5-Cp”)2Nd 
units bridged 
by a chloride ion and an Nd-CI-...Li+...Cl--Nd 
linkage. The Nd-C1 distances are 2.802 (1) and 2.754 (2) A, and LCI-Nd-CI 
= 97.1 (1)’. The (ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) angle is 121.3’. The Nd-C(ring) distances vary from 2.647 (7) to 2.815 
(7) A, with the shorter distances being to those carbon atoms closest to the Me2Si bridge. The Me2SiCp”,MC1, compounds 
react with LiCH[Si(CH,),], to yield ether- and halide-free Me2SiCp”2MCH[Si(CH3)3]2 
derivatives. The M = Nd compound 
crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2,/n with four molecules in a cell of dimensions (-125 ‘C) a = 10.229 (2) A, 
b = 15.623 (3) A, c = 19.687 (3) A, and @ = 105.41 (2)’. Least-squares refinement led to a value of the conventional R 
index (on F) 
of 0.044 for 3407 independent, absorption corrected reflections having I >  3 4 0 .  The molecular structure consists 
of monomeric Me2SiCp”2NdCH[Si(CH3)3]2 
units with q5-Cp” 
coordination, and L(ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) = 121.6’. 
The CH[Si(CH3)3]2 
fragment is coordinated to the Me,SiCp”,Nd center in a highly unsymmetrical fashion with a Nd-C 
o-bond distance of 2.506 (7) 8
,
 
and a secondary interaction to one methyl group of Nd-C = 2.862 (8) A. 
The Si-C distance 
to this carbon atom is significantly longer than the other Si-CH3 contacts. Approximate hydrogen atom locations argue against 
an important M.-HC(methyl) interaction and reveal a bending of the hydrogen atom on the o-bonded carbon atom toward 
the metal with LNd-C-H - 
76’. Reaction of the Me2SiCp”,MCH[Si(CH3),1, complexes with H2 
yields the coresponding 
hydrides, which are formulated as Me2SiCp”2M(pH)2MCp”2SiMe2 
dimers. These compounds are active agents for the 
polymerization of ethylene as well as for the oligomerization of propylene and 1-hexene. For a constant lanthanide ion, a 
(Me,sic~”,MH)~ 
hydride is an ca. 10 times more active for this reaction than the corresponding (Cp12MH), hydride. 
Deprotonation of Me,SiCp”,LuCH(TMS), with t-BuLilTMEDA leads to a metallacycle formulated as Li(TMEDA)3+- 
Me2SiCp”,LuCH2Si(CH3)2C(H)Si(CH,),-

In the previous paper in this issue,2 we describe general, 
straightforward synthetic approaches to and chemical/physico- 
chemical properties of the 4f hydrocarbyls and hydrides Cp’,MR 
(Cp’ = V ~ - ( C H ~ ) ~ C ~ ,  
R = CH[Si(CH,),],) and (Cp’,MH),, where

M = the lightest to heaviest lanthanide. The molecular structure 
of Cp’,NdCH(TMS), (TMS = Si(CH3),) features an unusual 
“semibridging” Nd-CH, interaction. The hydrides are some of 
the most active “homogeneous” 
ethylene polymerization and olefin 
hydrogenation catalysts yet di~covered.~~~ 
To the extent that these 
characteristics reflect factors such as coordinative unsaturation 
and the disposition/mobility of the Cp’ ligands, it would be of 
interest to further “open” the lanthanide coordination sphere. We 
describe here the synthesis, structural characterization, and some 
chemical properties of a new class of lanthanide hydrocarbyls and 
hydrides based upon the chelating bis(polymethylcyclopntadieny1) 
ligand A (Me,SiCp”2).4,5 Straightforward, general routes to

and hydride derivatives are reported for lanthanides 
from Nd to Lu. We have previously described a series of orga- 
nothorium complexes of this ligand and reported substantial (up 
to 1 
03) 
enhancements in catalytic activity over Cp’,Th analogues.6 
For the present case of lanthanides, ligand A also offers the 
possibility of reducing solid-state Cp’ structural disorder and 
undesirable CP’~M

Cp’M ligand redistribution processes.’ 
Experimental Section 
Procedures, synthetic techniques, materials, and instrumentation were 
as described previously.2 The ligand Me,Si(Cp”H), and the dilithium 
salt Me,Si(Cp”Li), were prepared as described el~ewhere.~.~ 
Mass

laboratory. Due to the irregular shape of the crystal, numerical ab- 
sorption corrections were not performed. Since psi scans indicated that 
absorption was not a serious problem, empirical correctionsI0 
were also 
not applied. Neutral atom scattering factors” were used with anomalous 
dispersion correctionsI2 being applied to the non-hydrogen atoms.I3 The 
structure was solved by standard Patterson and Fourier methods. 
Structural parameters were refined anisotropically to convergence, and 
the final agreement indexes are given in Table I. Hydrogen atoms were 
located from difference Fourier calculations but were not included in the 
model. The maximum peak height in the final difference electron density 
map was 1.140 e/A3. 
X-ray Crystallographic Study of Me,SiCp”,NdCH(TMS), 
(5).* 
Green crystals of Me,SiCp”,NdCH(TMS), 
suitable for diffraction 
studies were obtained by slow cooling of saturated pentane solutions to 
-30 OC. The crystals were sealed in glass capillaries and exammined on 
the aforementioned diffratometer at 148 K. They were found to be 
monoclinic, space group P2Jn. Accurate unit cell parameters (Table I) 
were determined by least-squares 
refinement of 21 high-angle reflections. 
Three-dimensional data were collected (53 
17 unique reflections having 
28MaKa 
< 50’) by using graphite monochromated Mo radiation and w/28 
scans (w scan width = 1.2O + 
0.35 tan S o ) .  Crystal and/or instrumental 
instability was monitored through the measurement of six standard re- 
flections that were collected after every 100 min of X-ray exposure time; 
there was no indication of crystal decomposition. Experimental details 
are compiled in Table I. 
Calculations were performed by using the hardware and software 
described above. The intensity data were corrected for absorption effects 
by using an empirical absorption curve based upon psi scan data.Io The 
structure was solved by standard Patterson and Fourier methods. Neu- 
tral atom scattering factors” were used with anomalous dispersion cor- 
rectionsI2 being applied to the non-hydrogen atoms.l’ Structural pa- 
rameters were refined to convergence as described in Table I. Hydrogen 
atoms were located in the difference Fourier calculation but were not 
specifically included in the refinement model. The maximum peak height 
in the final difference Fourier synthesis was 0.89 e/A3. 
Results and Discussion 
Synthesis. Halo Precursors and Hydrocarbyls. For lanthanides 
Nd, Sm, and Lu, tractable halo complexes of the Me2SiCp”, 
ligand are readily accessible via the approach of eq 1. These 
complexes were characterized by standard spectroscopic and 
analytical procedures.

difficulty was 
encountered in the lanthanum synthesis. Intractable products were 
obtained under all workup conditions. For the NdC1, reaction, 
a different workup procedure, using pentane rather than ether 
for extraction of the crude reaction product, yielded a crystalline 
material which was shown by X-ray diffraction to be

X-ray Crystallographic Study of (Me,SiCp”2NdCI)2CI-Li(THF)2C 
(4).* Irregular, light-blue crystals suitable for diffraction studies were 
obtained by extracting the crude solid reaction product of NdCI, + 
Me,Si(Cp”Li), in THF with pentane, filtering, and slowly cooling the 
filtrate. The crystals were sealed in glass capillaries and exammined on 
an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 automated diffractometer at 140 K. Monoclinic 
symmetry was inferred from the unit cell parameters and confirmed by 
analysis of symmetry equivalent intensities. Systematic extinctions were 
consistent with the space group P2/n. Accurate unit cell parameters were 
determined by least-squares refinement of 25 high-angle reflections. 
Three-dimensional data were collected (4722 unique reflections having 
28M& < 50’) by using graphite monochromated Mo radiation and w/2B 
scans (w scan width = 1.2O + 0.35 tan S O ) .  Crystal and/or instrumental 
instability was monitored through the measurement of six standard re- 
flections that were collected after every 100 min of X-ray exposure time; 
there was no indication of crystal decomposition. Experimental details

Sm derivatives exhibit large isotropic shifts. Some representative 
spectra are shown in Figure 1. Except for monotonic, temper- 
ature-dependent variations in isotropic shifts, which are typical 
of paramagnetic f-element complexes, 'H NMR spectra of 5 were 
independent of temperature between -90 and +90 OC. Thus, the 
free-energy barrier to Si-CH3 group interconversion is small and 
that for (CH3)4Cs 
ring interconversion is large. 
Molecular Structure of (Me2SiCp",NdCl)2CI-Li(THF)2+ 
(4). 
As can be seen in Figures 3 and 4, the molecular structure of 4 
is in effect a dimer, cconsisting 
of two Me,SiCp",Nd units bridged 
by a Cl--Li+-Cl- 
assembly (reminiscent of [CH2- 
(C5H4)2UC12]2C1-Li+(THF)25a). 
The molecule possesses a 
crystallographic 2-fold axis extending through the lithium ion and 
the single bridging chloride (Cll). Final atomic coordinates and 
anisotropic thermal parameters are given in Tables I1 and III,* 
respectively, while important bond lengths and angles are given 
along with estimated standard deviations in Table IV (the atom 
labeling scheme is shown in Figures 2 and 3). 
The coordination pattern about the Nd3+ ion(s) in 4 is a 
modification of the common Cp',MX, type.2,7,14J5 
It differs in

Molecular Structure of Me2SiCp”2NdCH[Si(CH3)3]2 
(5). 
Perspective views of compound 5 along ‘with the atom labeling 
scheme are given in Figures 4 and 5. Final atomic coordinates 
and anisotropic thermal parameters are compiled in Tables V and 
VI,* respectively. Important bond lengths and angles along with 
estimated standard deviations are presented in Table VII. 
The Me2SiCp”, ligation in 5 is rather similar to that in 
(Me2SiCp”2NdC1)2C1-Li(THF)2’ 
(4) while the CH(TMS), co- 
ordination (vide infra) is similar to, but more precisely defined 
than, that in the disordered structure of Cp’,NdCH(TMS), ( 
12)., 
Thus, the (ring centroid)-Nd-(ring centroid) angle in 5 is 121.6’ 
and the C3-Sil-C8 angle, 101.2 (3)’. The C5 
rings are coplanar 
to within 0.006 (9) A, while the methyl groups are displaced 
0.02-0.19 (1) 8
,
 
from the C5 
mean planes in a direction away from 
the Nd ion. As in 4, the longest Nd-C(ring) distances are for 
the carbon atoms furthest from the Me,Si bridge. As in 4, the 
alternation in framework C-C distances about the C5 
rings is 
rather small. Detailed comparison of Tables IV and VI1 shows 
that the Nd-C(ring) and intra-Me,SiCp”, metrical parameters 
in 4 and 5 are in close agreement.

Nd-hydrocarbyl interaction, which is particularly evident in Figure 
4. Thus, the Nd-C21-Si3 angle is 132.4 (4)’ while the Nd- 
C21-Si2 angle is 96.7 (3)’ (the corresponding angles in 122 
are 
140.15 (43)’ and 98.44 (31)’). Skewing of the Nd-CH(TMS), 
interaction is also evident in the Sil-Nd-C21 angle of 156.6 (2)’. 
Atoms Nd, C21, Si2, and Si3 are coplanar to within 0.04 (1) 8
,
 
(vs. 0.02 (1) 8
,
 
in 12). At least part of the valence angle expansion 
about C21 must reflect the steric bulk of the TMS groups, since 
similar expansions have been observed in H,C[Si(CH,),],, 123.2 
(9)’, and HC[Si(CH3),I3, 116.3 (4)’.,O 
As in 12,2 
the primary Nd-hydrocarbyl interaction in 5 (Nd- 
C21 = 2.506 (7) 8
,
)
 
is supplemented by a significant secondary 
interaction to a single methyl group: Nd-C22 = 2.862 (8) 8
,
 
(these distances are 2.517 (7) and 2.895 (7) A in 12). The average 
of all Si-CH, distances in 5 other then Si2-C22 is 1.870 (10, 7, 
17, 5 )  8
,
,
 
in good agreement with distances in other trimethylsilyl 
compounds (usually about 1.873 
The distances C21-Si2 
= 1.827 (8) 8, and C21-Si3 = 1.834 (8) 8, are slightly shorter 
than the corresponding lengths in molecules such as H2C[Si(C- 
H3)3]220 
(1.889 (4) A). The mutually “eclipsed” conformation 
of the two Si(CH3), groups in 5 is identical with that in H2C- 
[Si(CH3)3]2.20 
Interestingly, Si2-C22 is 1.928 (8) A, a value 
which appears to be significantly longer than the aforementioned 
average of the other Si-CH3 distances. The Nd-CH(TMS)2 
orientations in 5 and 12 are thus rather similar, despite the 
“pulled-back” permethylcyclopentadienyl ligands in 5. It seems

Highly Reactive Organolanthanides 
unlikely, then, that the close Nd-C22 contact and the elongated 
Si2-C22 bond are the result of nonbonded repulsive interactions 
rather than attractive bonding interactions. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the hydrogen atoms bound to carbon 
atoms C21 and C22. The hydrogen atoms in 5 could be readily 
located in the difference Fourier calculation, and although the 
associated metrical parameters must be viewed with appropriate 
precautions2I and are clearly no substitute for neutron diffraction 
data, significant qualitative remarks can be made. First, the 
disposition of hydrogen atoms H2, H3, and H4 does not minimize 
any particular Nd-H distance as in many “agostic” C-H-M 
structural motifs.22 Rather, the hydrogen atom disposition (as 
well as the Si2-C22 lengthening) is more reminiscent of three- 
center, two-electron bridging alkyl bonding, the extreme orga- 
nolanthanide examples of which are found in [CP’~M(F-CH~)]~ 
(E) and Cp’2M(p-CH3)2A1(CH3)2

for 12,2 
the close Nd-C contact, the lengthening of Si2-C22, and 
the syn-periplanar conformation are structurally suggestive of a 
P - ~ n e t h y l ~ ~  
elimination scenario which is aborted due to the un- 
acceptable high energy content25 
of the resulting Si=C moiety. 
Also noteworthy in 5 is the curious position of of the hydrogen 
atom H1-bent 
toward the Nd ion with LNd-C21-H1 - 
76O. 
This arrangement results in a Nd-H1 distance of ca. 2.5 8

(assuming C21-Hl = 1.09 A), which can be compared with 
neutron-diffraction-derived Th-H terminal and bridge distances 
of 2.03 (1) and 2.29 (3) A, respectively, in [Cp’2Th(p-H)H]2.25 
Correcting for differences in eight-coordinate radii,I9 Nd-H 
distances of ca. 2.09 and 2.37 8, are estimated for terminal and 
fully bridging configurations. Although part of this “agostic” or 
semibridging CHNd interaction no doubt reflects the near pla- 
narity of the Nd, C21, Si2, and Si3 fragment, which in turn must 
reflect the bulkiness of the C21 substitutents,20 
it also appears 
likely that part of the interaction reflects the high electrophilicity 
and electron deficiency at the metal center (e.g., C). Such

react rapidly with 
hydrogen to yield the corresponding 
hydrides (eq

the hydrogenolysis of a given Me2SiCp’’2MCH(TMS)2 
complex 
is more rapid under the same conditions than is hydrogenolysis 
of the analogous Cp’,MCH(TMS), complex. Hydrides 13-15

are less soluble 
than the (Cp’,MH), analogues2 
and can be isolated 
from reaction 3 in essentially quantitative yield after filtration 
and washing. ‘H NMR data are given in the Experimental 
Section. Exchange of metal-bound hydride with toluene-d8 
deuterons is qualitatively more rapid than for the (CP’,MH)~ 
analogues,2 
and the hydride signals for the Me2SiCp”, Sm and 
Lu hydrides could only be observed under an atmosphere of H2. 
As in the case of the CP’~MX 
systems, progression from X = 
CH(TMS)2 to X = H renders the permethylcyclopentadienyl 
ligands magnetically equivalent. Complex 13 is dimeric in benzene 
solution by cryoscopy. 
Infrared spectral data for 13-15, 13d, and 15d are collected 
in the Experimental Section. Unlike the (Cp’2MH)2/(Cp’2MD)2 
complexes, where the infrared spectra of the M = Lu derivatives 
differ significantly from those of other M derivatives, the spectra 
of the present hydrides are essentially independent of M, suggesting 
very similar molecular structures. 
Because of interfering 
Me,SiCp”,-centered vibrational modes, assignments of M-H/ 
M-D transitions cannot be as detailed as in the (Cp’,MH), series. 
Nevertheless, a broad band at ca. 1120 cm-I is again observed, 
which shifts to ca. 820 cm-I in the deuterated deriatives ( v ~ - ” / v ~ - ~  
= 1.37). Taken together with mass spectral and cryoscopic 
molecular weight data, these results suggest a dimeric M(w-H),M 
structure (I). This formulation is consistent with the solubility

That both

dimeric in diffraction studies also supports this proposal. 
Reaction Chemistry with Olefins. Comparison to (Cp’,MH), 
Complexes. It was also of interest to determine whether the altered 
permethycyclopentadienyl disposition in the Me2SiCp”, complexes 
significantly modified reactivity with respect to olefin insertion. 
Thus, to the extent that it was possible, reactions were carried 
out by using procedures identical with those for analogous 
(Cp’,MH), compounds.2 One complication was the significantly 
lower solubility of the (Me2SiCp”2MH)2 
complexes. Thus, for 
ethylene polymerization experiments, catalyst concentrations were 
at such a dilute level that poisoning by trace contaminants became 
possible. Nevertheless, for (Me2SiCp”2NdH)2 
at 25 OC, 1 atm 
of ethylene pressure, an N, value of 1.6 s-’ was measured for 
polymerization. 
Catalyst solubilities were less of a problem for the slower 
propylene and 1 
-hexene reactions since additional quantities of 
the hydrides dissolved upon olefin addition. In situ ‘ H  NMR

Vol. 107, No. 26, 1985 
studies revealed rapid consumption of the hydrides and the for- 
mation of multiple products. No interpretation was attempted 
since other data (vide infra) indicate that olefin insertion is more 
facile for the Me2SiCp", 
complexes. 
Reaction of 
(Me2SiCp"2LuH)2 
with propylene was studied in cyclohexane at 
25 'C (4.0-atm gauge pressure) and at 66 "C (6.5-atm gauge 
pressure). Yields of propylene oligomers were approximately 10 
times those in the (Cp',L~H)~-catalyzed 
reaction under the same 
conditions.2 For the 66 O
C
 reaction, GC/MS data revealed a 
complex product mixture with greater than 20 components having 
carbon contents at least as high as C2]. A reasonable mechanism 
for hydride-induced propylene oligomerization followed, inter alia, 
involve olefin insertion into the lanthanide-hydride bond (eq 4), 
followed, 
inter alia, by sequential olefin insertion into the resulting 
lanthanide-carbon bond (e.g., eq 5)2,14 
and termination by olefin 
metalation (e.g., eq 6),2 @-hydrogen elimination (eq 7),23'4 
or 
@-methyl 
elimination (eq 
8).14924 As already noted: slowly stirring

(0.03%), and C36H72D2 (0.01%) were detected 
by GC/MS. Additional 1-hexene insertions followed by deu- 
teronolysis of the Lu-C bond2 explain the presence and isotopic 
substitution of these higher oligomers. 
Stirring 70 mg of ( M ~ , S ~ C ~ ' / , L U H ) ~  
in 30 mL of 1-hexene 
under 1 atm of ethylene for 10 min yielded, after quenching and 
workup, 3.5 g of a rubbery ethylene/l-hexene copolymer. By "C

17 
NMR, the ratio of ethylene/l-hexene in the polymer was de- 
termined to be ca. 3:l (e.g., 17). These results indicate, not 
surprisingly, that the rate of chain propagation is highly sensitive 
to the steric bulk that must be incorporated near the metal center. 
Thus, while configuration 18 cannot support rapid 1-hexene in- 
sertion, ethylene insertion is relatively facile.

and %Me2 signals are observed along with SiMe3 and LuCH 
singlets. Moreover, lowering of the Me2SiCp", symmetry from

Conclusions 
This work demonstrates that it is possible to generate a series 
of ring-connected lanthanide hydrocarbyl and hydride derivatives 
which parallel the previously described2 Cp',MCH(TMS),, 
( C P ' ~ M H ) ~  
series. While gross structural features and reaction 
pathways are similar for analogous Cpt2M and Me,SiCp",M 
derivatives, significant 
reactivity increases are observed in the latter 
series for sterically sensitive processes such as olefin insertion into 
the Cp'2MR/Me2SiCp"2MR metal-carbon u bond. The degree 
to which such modifications can affect reaction rates in olefin 
hydrogenation catalysis is explored in the preceding paper in this 
issue.3
