Infrared reflection absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS) 
was used to study the adsorption of CO on 
a S-modified 
Mo( 110) surface. As the surface S 
coverage is increased to 0.5 ML, the sulfur overlayer structure changes 
from ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
to ~(2x2). 
These changes can be 
observed in the IRAS 
spectra of adsorbed CO. In addition, 
it was noted that in the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer sulfur actedmainly 
as a site blocker, whereas in the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer 
electron-withdrawing effects became apparent. Finally, the dissociative adsorption of CO was seen to occur 
on both clean Mo(l10) and p(ZXZ)S/Mo(llO) but not on c(2X2)S/Mo(llO). 
Introduction 
The interactions 
between sulfur and transition-metal surfaces 
have been the object of many studies over the past two decades. 
This interest is due in part to the pronounced effect that surface 
sulfur has on molecular adsorption and reaction processes on 
An additional reason for this interest is the utility 
of molybdenum sulfides as hydrodesulfurization 
catalysts during 
hydrocarbon conversion reactions.*g9 In an attempt to understand 
these effects, numerous studies have been conducted on the 
structure 
of surface S 
overlayers.l*l6 These 
studies 
have sought 
to determine the S 
adsorption sites as a function of S 
coverage, 
which would allow insight into the observed inhibition of 
adsorption (poisoning) or reaction selectivity changes observed 
on S-modified surfaces. 
In thisstudy, the adsorptionof carbon monoxideon a presulfided 
M
o
(

10) surface was examined using infrared reflection- 
absorption sptctroscopy 
(IRAS) and thermal 
desorption 
methods. 
The results obtained in this study will be discussed in terms o
f
 
the site-blocking (poisoning) and electron-withdrawing 
nature 
of the S 
adatoms. 
Experimental Section 
The experiments were performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum 
chamber (base pressure 55 X 1&lo Torr) equipped for IRAS, 
Auger electron spectroscopy, (AES), low-energy electron dif- 
fraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption 
(TPD). 
This apparatus has been described 
in detail e1~ewhere.l~ 
The sample was spot-welded to two Ta wires on the back face of 
thecrystal, allowing resistive heating 
to 1500 
K and liquid nitrogen 
cooling to 90 K. An electron beam assembly allowed heating to 
2000 K with the sample temperature being monitored with a 
W

%
 
Re/W-26% Re thermocouple. The crystal surface was 
cleaned using a relatively simple procedure: oxidation at 1500 
K in 2 X 10-7 Torr of oxygen followed by annealing in vacuum 
at a temperature of 2000 K. After this procedure, C, 0, 
and S 
surface impurities were determined to be less than 1%. The 
cleanliness and long-range 
order of the surface 
were verified with 
AES and LEED, respectively. The IRAS 
spectra were acquired 
for 256 scans in the single reflection mode at a resolution of 4 
cm-’ and an incidence angle of 8 5 O  from the surface normal. The 
spectra shown are raw data, corrected only for the base line. 
To deposit sulfur onto the surface, the sample was dosed with 
HIS. Heating to >500 K 
caused the H2S 
to decompose with the

hydrogen desorbing, leaving only S 
on the surface. The H2S 
used was cleaned by freezing 
the H2S in liquid nitrogen and then 
vacuum-distilling 
off the dissolved gases. The CO used in this 
work was obtained from Matheson, was 99.99% pure, and was 
used without further purification. Gas exposures in this work 
are given in terms of langmuirs (1 langmuir = 1 X 10-6 Toms). 
All adsorbate coverages are referenced to the number of Mo 
surface atoms (1.428 X 1015 
atoms/cm2) with one sulfur atom 
per Mo atom corresponding 
to 0s = 1.00 monolayer (ML). 
Results and Discussion 
IR spectra of CO adsorbed on various coverages of S 
on a 
Mo( 1 
10) 
surface 
are shown in Figure 1. The 
sulfur was deposited 
by exposing the sample to H2S at 90 K. Subsequent heating to 
1400 
K causes the H2S to decompose into H2 (which desorbs at 
400-500 K) 
and elemental S 
and forms a stable, ordered S 
overlayer. The IRAS 
spectra shown in this figure were then 
acquired 
at 90 K after a saturation CO exposure. Figure 2 shows 
the peak positions and total integrated peak area for the spectra 
in Figure 1. As the sulfur coverage is increased from 0.0 to 
-0.35 ML, the CO peak position shifts from 2035 to -2010 
cm-’. At a sulfur coverage of 0.29 ML, a new peak appears at 
2037 cm-I. The intensity of this peak increases with further 
increases 
in S 
coverage. At a sulfur coverage of 0.5 ML, this new 
peak is the only peak observable with a frequency 
of 2045 cm-1.

The 
sulfur coverages 
were determined from the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
LEED 
pattern (see 
Figure 3) that was observed for the highest S 
coverage 
obtainableusing theabove S 
depositionmethod. A ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
LEED 
pattern has a coverage defined to be 
0.50 ML. The S 
coverage 
assignment is further supported by a ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
LEED pattern at 
8s = 
0.25 ML. These LEED patterns were then used to calibrate 
AES measurements. S/Mo AES peak intensity ratios were then 
used to determine S 
coverages in all subsequent experiments. 
Previous work on S/Mo( 110) supports the use of LEED patterns 
to establish S 
coverages on Mo( 1 
10).14 
ThecontinuousshiftoftheCGMOpeakfrom2035 
to -2010 
cm-1 as the sulfur coverage is increased from 0.00 to -0.35 ML 
can be explained by a simple site-blocking mechanism. Figure 
2 shows that as the S 
coverage is increased from 0.00 to -

ML, the total integrated CO 
intensity decreases 
to approximately 
75% of its original value. This implies a 25% reduction in CO 
coverage. If the adsorbed S 
is acting simply as a site blocker, a 
25% reduction in CO coverage would indicate a S 
coverage of 
0.25 ML. This is in reasonable agreement with the 0

coverage measured and supports a site-blocking 
mechanism. To 
further explore 
CO 
coverage 
changes as a function of S 
coverage, 
CO TPD spectra were obtained as a function of S 
coverage (see 
Figure 4). This figure also shows that the amount of adsorbed 
Codecreases 
as the S 
coverage 
is increased. The 
CO TPD 
results 
indicate that, at a S 
coverage of 0.2 ML, the CO coverage 
is only 
75% of the amount on clean Mo(ll0). These TPD results are 
A 
J 
I 
in good agreement with the IR results and further support the 
previous data indicating that, for sulfur coverages up to -0.3 
ML on Mo( 1 
lo), sulfur acts primarily as a site blocker (poison). 
It is 
well-known that on almost 
all surfaces 
CO 
peak frequencies 
shift as the CO coverage 
changes.’*-20 This shift in peak position 
is usually toward higher frequency as the CO coverage increases 
and is typically explained as being due to a reduction in 2r 
back- 
donation upon increasing CO coverage.1s-20 For CO adsorption 
on S/Mo(100) surfaces, this shift toward higher frequency was 
also seen. Figures 5-7 show the CO exposure 
dependence 
of the 
CO IRAS spectra at S 
coverages of 0.20, 0.35, and 0.50 ML, 
respectively. For these data, the Mo( 110) sample was exposed 
to H2S at 90 K and then flashed 
to 1400 
K to desorb the hydrogen 
and anneal 
the overlayer. CO 
exposure 
and IR 
spectral 
acquisition 
were at 90 K. For all three S coverages, there was an 
approximately 15-cm-1 increase in the CO stretching frequency 
as the CO coverage was increased to saturation (10 langmuirs). 
Thus, it is implicit that a decrease in the CO peak position would 
result from a decrease in the CO coverage. It is likely, therefore,

that the red shift in peak frequency seen in Figure 2 as the S 
coverage is increased to -0.3 ML is due to a decrease in CO 
coverage. 
The data in Figures 5-7 indicate that CO adsorbed 
on ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
S 
domains has a peak frequency of -2040 cm-I. This peak 
frequency is likely due to the electron-withdrawing 
nature of S. 
Assuming that the most likely position for S 
atom on the Mo- 
(1 10) 
surface 
is in the hollow sites,14 
real space 
surface structures 
corresponding to the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
and ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
LEED patterns can be 
deduced and are shown in Figure 3. It is apparent from the 
structure shown in Figure 3b for 0.5 ML of S 
on the Mo( 110) 
surface that the likely sites for CO adsorption would be on top 
between two S 
atoms 
or in a 4-fold hollow site with four adjacent 
S 
atoms. Due to the steric crowding at the a-top site, it is likely 
that the preferred site would be the hollow site. The stretching 
frequency for CO adsorbed on this surface, however, shows a 
peakat 2045 cm-l (see Figure 
7
)
.
 This is a rather high frequency 
to be associated with CO 
adsorbed in a hollow site. In a previous 
HREELS study of CO adsorption on S/Ni( loo), CO adsorbed 
on a ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
structure was observed to have a frequency 
of 21 15 
cm-l and was attributed to adsorption in a 4-fold Ni hollow 
between four S 
atoms with highly reduced back-donation into 
the 2rorbital due 
to theadsorbed 
sulfurss It is, therefore, plausible 
The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 98, No. 1, 1994 261 
that the peak at 2045 cm-l is due to CO adsorption 
in hollow sites 
with the unusually high frequency being due to the electron- 
withdrawing effect of the adjacent sulfur atoms. 
The spectra shown in Figure 6 
for CO adsorption on a Mo- 
(1 
10) 
surface 
with 0.35 ML of S 
clearly have two distinct features 
One is at -2010 cm-l and the other at -2030 cm-1. The low- 
frequency feature has been attributed to CO adsorbed on a 
p(2X2)S-covered surface 
while the high-frequency peak has been 
attributed to CO adsorbed on a c(2X2)S-covered 
surface. The 
fact that both features are present in Figure 6 
clearly indicates 
that, at sulfur coverage of 0.35 ML, domains of both ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
and ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
are in coexistence on the surface. Due to the 
proximity of the two peaks, there is likely a strong transfer of 
intensity from the low-frequency peak to the high-frequency 
peak.21-23 As the CO coverage increases, this effect will increase 
due to the increased proximity of the CO molecules. "Intensity- 
transfer"'8J1.22 and "s~recning"~~-~~ 
effects can significantly 
perturb observed IR peak intensities. The "intensity-transfer" 
effect is a strong dipoleciipole coupling between CO molecules 
adsorbed 
on a surface that results in the transfer of intensity from 
a low-frequency mode to a high-frequency mode.18121923 A good 
example 
of this effect is in the spectra of coadsorbed IZCW 
and 
12C'80 
where the observed IRAS peaks are at equal intensity for 
a 5% I2Cl60/95% 
12C180 
mixture.23 In addition, a suppression 
in the IRAS intensity of a CO-Pt( 11 
1) peak has been observed 
when CO is coadsorbed with a highly polarizable species like 
CHpOH, H20, or Xe.26 The polarizable species can induce a 
considerable 
shielding of the local electric field around the CO 
molecule, "screening" its dipole moment. More importantly, 
this 
effect has also been observed for CO adsorbed on submonolayer 
Cu and Ag on Pt(l1 
l)?4.2s 
Cu on Ru(OOO~)?~*~~ 
and Ni on Mo- 
(1 10).29,30 
Due to the polarizability of the overlayer adatoms 
upon CO adsorption, 
the CO-adatom ensembles are effective at 
screening 
the intensity of chemisorbed CO on the overlayer-free 
s~bstrate.~~-*s 
Thus, intensity-transfer effects make it likely that 
the low-frequency peak is the majority surface species, even at 
high CO coverages. One would intuitively expect the low- 
frequency (~(2x2)s) 
peak to be larger since at a S 
coverage of 
0.35 ML, 40% of the surface should be ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains while 
the remaining 60% would be ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains. However, these 
intuitive abundances do not account for the fact that, for the 
1-langmuir 
exposure shown in Figure 6
,
 
a generous estimate of 
the amount of CO on ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains (high-frequency 
peak) 
would be 25% of the total surface CO. Thus, it would appear 
that the initial CO sticking probability is higher on the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains than it is on the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains. 
IR spectra of CO on S/Mo(llO) as a function of sample 
temperature are shown in Figures 8-10. For these figures, the 
M
o
(
 
1 
10) surface was exposed to the HzS at 90 K and flashed to 
1400 K to desorb the hydrogen and anneal the overlayer. CO 
exposure 
was at 90 K, and spectral acquisition was at 
the indicated 
temperatures. All three figures show the expected red shift in 
stretching frequency as the CO coverage is reduced due to 
desorption. The desorption temperatures indicated in the IR 
data are in excellent agreement with the TPD data shown in 
Figure 4. For S 
coverages of 0.35 ML or below, molecular 
desorption 
occurs 
at 330 K; however, for 0.5 ML of S, 
desorption 
occurs at 300 K. This decrease in desorption temperature for 
CO adsorbed on S/Mo( 
1 
10) surfaces with S 
coverages in excess 
of 0.35 ML is a further indication of a sulfur interaction 
withdrawing charge from the Mo 
surface. As discussed above, 
the electron-withdrawing 
effect of the adsorbed 
S 
will reduce the 
charge donation from the Mo 
atoms to the adsorbed CO. This 
will lead to a weaker metal-CO bond (lower desorption tem- 
perature). The lower desorption temperature for CO bound to 
thec(2X2)S phase (high-frequency peak) compared 
to CO 
bound 
to the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
phase (low-frequency peak) is clearly evident in 
Figure 9. In addition, by applying the Redhead approximation)'

to the peak desorption maxima shown in Figure 4 and assuming 
a frequency factor of 1013. one can calculate adsorption energies 
of 20.1, 20.1, and 18.2 kcal/mol for CO adsorbed molecularly 
on clean Mo(llO), the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer, and the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer, respectively. These bond energies further reinforce 
earlier indications that, in the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer, the S 
merely 
acts as a site blocker without noticeably affecting the bonding of 
the CO to the Mo surface. Whereas, for the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer, 
the S 
electronically perturbs the surface changing the bonding 
OftheStotheMosurface. Thus, thec(2x2) 0.50MLSoverlayer 
both induces CO adsorption at 4-fold hollow sites (2045-cm-1 
peak) and also decreases the binding energy of the CO adsorbed 
on these sites. In addition, it is possible that these bond energy 
differences 
are 
a contributing factor to the preferential adsorption 
of CO on the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains that was observed for the 
1-langmuir exposure spectrum in Figure 6. 
There is an additional effect that occurs when S 
is adsorbed 
onto a Mo( 
1 10) 
surface. Dissociative CO 
adsorption is reduced. 
This result has been observed previously4 and is clearly evident

not only decreases the amount of dissociatively adsorbed CO but 
also facilitates the recombinative dissociation 
of the CO. In the 
previous 
study, the reduced 
dissociative 
adsorption 
was explained 
as being due to an increase in desorption rate, not a decrease in 
the desorption rate con~tant.~ 
The lower CO desorption tem- 
peratures at higher S 
coverages observed in this work are in 
qualitative agreement with this earlier study. The lack of CO 
dissociation on the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
overlayer was observed in the IR 
spectra oftheCO 
adsorbed on this surface. Repeatedadsorption- 
desorption cycles produced no IR features at -2100 cm-' due 
to C buildup on this surface. On the ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
or clean Mo( 1

surfaces, 
on the other hand, 
adsorption-desorption 
cycles produced 
a pronounced peak at -2100 cm-I, due to carbon buildup. 
Summary 
and Conclusions 
Sulfur is a common surface contaminant and has been shown 
to have pronounced effect on the adsorption of C0.3,417 These 
effects are clearly evident in the IRAS spectra of CO 
adsorption 
on S/Mo( 110) presented earlier. The spectra shown in Figure 
1 reflect the dual nature of adsorbed S. 
It can act as both a site 
blocker and/or an electron-withdrawing agent. The fact that S 
can affect CO adsorption in both a site-blocking' and electron- 
withdrawing3 fashion has, of course, been observed before. 
However, the fact that these effects can be observed in the CO 
IRAS spectra is another example of the utility of this technique. 
In Figures 1 and 2, it is clear that from a sulfur coverage of 
-0.25 ML up to a coverage of -0.35 ML that both ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
and ~ ( 2 x 2 ) s  
domains exist on the surface at the same time. The 
lack of an abrupt change as the S 
coverage is increased implies 
that this is not really a phase 
transition from the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
structure 
to the 42x2) structure, but rather just the gradual filling in of 
the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
overlayer lattice structure with additional S 
atoms 
to give the ~ ( 2 x 2 )  
structure. Finally, the results of this study 
clearly indicated that dissociative CO adsorption is strongly 
inhibited on the c(2x2)S/Mo( 110) surface.
