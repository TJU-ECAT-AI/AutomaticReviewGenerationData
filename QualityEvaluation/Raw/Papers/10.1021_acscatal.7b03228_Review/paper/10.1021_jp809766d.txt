Abstract
Water−gas shift chemistry provides a useful method for producing hydrogen from coal; however, fuel cell applications demand that this hydrogen be free of impurities. Due to their unique properties, Pd/Cu alloys represent an import class of materials used for H purification membranes and also serve as the active metals in many heterogeneous catalysts. Little is known about how Pd and Cu interact electronically in these mixed systems and there is debate in the literature over the direction of charge transfer between the two species. This study used the differential conductance (dI/dV) spectroscopy capabilities of a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to investigate the atomic-scale electronic structure of Pd/Cu surface alloys. dI/dV spectroscopy gives a direct measure of the local density of states of surface sites with subnanometer precision. Results from this work demonstrate that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu lattice are almost electronically identical to their host atoms. Over an energy range that spans 1 eV on either side of the Fermi level, the only significant electronic difference between isolated Pd and their host Cu atoms is that Pd atoms have a very slightly depleted electron density in the region of the Cu surface state maximum.

Introduction
Bimetallic alloys are currently being studied in great detail due to their desirable catalytic properties and multiple uses in hydrogen-related chemistry. (1) H2 purity is crucial for applications such as fuel cells. (2) Pd is highly selective for H separation; thus, Pd-rich membranes such as PdCu alloys are often employed for this application. These alloyed membranes are more resistant to contamination and are more robust than their pure Pd counterparts. (3-5) PdCu alloys are also widely used in catalysis due to their reactivity and selectivity for reactions such as oxidation of CO and alkenes, (6) hydrogenation of organic substances, (7) reduction of NO to N28−10 and liquid-phase nitrate removal from drinking water. (11)
Due to the technological importance of these binary alloys, a wide variety of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in order to elucidate the surface physics and chemistry of these systems. (3, 12-23) The bulk alloys exist in both ordered and disordered phases; however, at most catalytically relevant temperatures and compositions, the binary Pd−Cu system is a disordered fcc alloy. (24-27) Surface studies have shown that the top atomic layer of Pd/Cu alloys is rich in Cu, whereas the near-surface region (∼7 atomic layers) is rich in Pd. (28) However, if there are strongly interacting adsorbates present, Pd is brought to the surface. (21) Similar diffusion and exchange of surface/subsurface atoms in other metal alloy systems has also been observed. As a reaction proceeded on the surface of a Pt50Rh50(100) alloy, changes in the alloy’s surface composition were related to the exact stoichiometry of the reactants. (29)
The excellent catalytic properties of Pd/Cu alloys have been discussed in terms of both ligand and ensemble effects. (30-32) Ligand effects refer to the change in catalytic properties due to electronic interactions between the two elements of a bimetallic alloy. Ensemble effects refer to the spatial distribution of atomic sites that host reactants. Some reactions that require larger ensembles of reactive atoms to catalyze a transformation are halted when the active atom is monodispersed throughout an inert lattice. Surface studies have focused on elucidating both of these effects for the Pd/Cu system using a variety of techniques.
Photoelectron spectroscopies have been used to investigate ligand effects in these alloys in order to quantify the charge transfer between the Cu and Pd atoms. (12, 13, 15, 20, 22, 23, 33, 34) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures the binding energy of electrons in core levels of the surface atoms in a sample and can, in certain instances, be used to quantify charge transfer between atoms or, in other words, determine oxidation states. (35) However, XPS studies of Pd/Cu alloys have shown that the core levels of both Pd and Cu can shift either up or down in energy depending on the composition and annealing history of the alloy, and debate over the charge state of the atoms continues. (13, 20, 23, 33, 36, 37) Core level shifts in XPS occur not only from charge transfer but from other initial state effects including changes in coordination number, orbital rehybridization, and final state effects such as screening. (20, 37) Therefore, XPS cannot be used as a direct method for determining the electronic state of the constituents of an alloy. A few ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies have also been performed on the Pd/Cu system; (33, 34) Hedman and co-workers used UPS to show that the higher the Pd content of the alloy, the more electron density exists just at and below the Fermi level (EF).
The composition of Pd/Cu alloys is heterogeneous at the atomic-scale, and all of the techniques discussed previously are ensemble measurements that average over many μm2 of the surface. Therefore, important nanoscale detail about the surface composition and electronic structure may be lost due to averaging. While previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies (27) have explained much of the structural information about this system, the electronic interplay between Pd and Cu has remained a mystery at the atomic level. The aim of the current work is to elucidate the local composition and electronic structure of Pd/Cu{111} with STM imaging and dI/dV spectroscopy. These techniques allow the electronic structure of individual Pd atoms to be measured both in and under the Cu surface. Using exactly the same STM tip, dI/dV spectra of both the Cu and Pd atoms were measured and the results served as a direct comparison of the electronic structure of both sites without the possibility of any tip artifacts in the spectra. Also, as dI/dV spectra represent the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of energy, one can not only track the direction of charge transfer, but determine which energy levels are involved.
Experimental Methods
All experiments were performed in a low-temperature, ultrahigh-vacuum (LT-UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (Omicron). (38) The very high stability of the microscope at 78 and 7 K allows for the study of a particular area of the surface for many hours and allows point spectroscopy to be performed with a minimum amount of z-drift (<0.01 nm/hour). A Cu{111} single crystal was purchased from MaTecK and cleaned by cycles of argon ion sputtering (1 keV/10 μA) and annealing at 820 K. Pd was deposited on the Cu{111} surface by resistively heating a Pd wrapped W wire while the Cu{111} sample was held at a set temperature. The Pd doser was calibrated by STM imaging of a large area. All Pd coverages in this paper are 0.010 ± 0.001 ML (1% ML). The sample was then transferred into the STM chamber where it was cooled to either 78 K for imaging or 7 K for spectroscopy. dI/dV spectra were recorded using a lock-in amplifier by modulating the bias voltage with a 1000 Hz ac amplitude of 14 mV and recorded with a 10 ms time constant. The I vs V curves acquired simultaneously with the dI/dV vs V measurement were always linear, therefore, no correction needed to be made to the dI/dV values for nonlinear conductance. The fact that the same tip was used to acquire spectra of Pd and Cu atoms meant that the differences in the dI/dV values were directly proportional to differences in the LDOS of the atoms and not dependent on the tip state. (39)
Results and Discussion
In order to study the electronic properties of a dilute amount of Pd in a Cu host, small amounts of Pd were deposited onto a Cu(111) crystal surface. To ensure that Pd atoms were indeed being studied instead of defects on the Cu surface, particular attention was paid to the cleanliness of the bare Cu{111} surface before depositing Pd. The Cu{111} surface consisted of large flat terraces of average diameter 150 nm separated by monatomic steps. A typical image of the clean surface is shown in Figure 1. In the inset of Figure 1, the hexagonal packing of the Cu atoms can be seen. Such atomic resolution images of these bare surfaces revealed that after multiple cleaning cycles there was less than 1 defect per 1000 nm2.
Figure 1
Figure 1. STM image of bare Cu{111}, which is characterized by wide, flat terraces separated by monatomic step edges, where the yellow terrace is topographically the highest area. The inset shows the hexagonal surface symmetry of Cu atoms in the Cu{111} surface. (Imaging conditions: I = 10 pA, Vtip = −0.5 V, 78 K, z-range = 500 pm. Inset: I = 2 nA, Vtip = 0.07 V, 78 K, z-range = 40 pm.)
After deposition, the majority of the Pd was incorporated into the surface via ascending step edges. (27) A typical image after deposition of 0.01 ML of Pd is shown in Figure 2, where it is seen that nearly all of the Pd is found in the regions at the top of Cu{111} step edges. In most cases the size of the Cu/Pd alloy “brims” which formed on the Cu{111} step edges were dependent in size on the lower terrace. This is consistent with the predominant mechanism for surface alloying being adsorption on a terrace, diffusion to an ascending step edge and incorporation in the area above the step edge via place exchange. (27) The fact that larger terraces had larger brims of Pd above them supports this as the main mechanism for incorporation on Pd in the Cu crystal. This makes the surface coverage rather heterogeneous and dependent on local step density. Hence, the quoted 0.01 ML Pd coverage is a global average in all experiments presented here.
Figure 2
Figure 2. STM image of Cu{111} after deposition of 0.01 ML Pd. Pd is incorporated into the Cu{111} surface via ascending step edges to form “brims”. The yellow terrace is the topographically highest area. (Imaging conditions: I = 0.1 nA, Vtip = 0.4 V, 78 K, z-range = 700 pm.)
Atomic-scale imaging was performed at a temperature of 78 K in order to resolve the positions of the Pd atoms in the Cu host after alloying at different temperatures. Due to the different diameters (Cu = 0.256 nm and Pd = 0.275 nm) and electronic properties of Cu and Pd atoms, the two species can be differentiated in atomically resolved STM images. (27, 40-42)Varga and Schmid explained the origin of chemical contrast in different alloy systems in terms of both intrinsic differences in electronic/geometric structure and tip−sample interaction. (40) The Besenbacher and Goodman groups have recently performed high-resolution STM studies on Cu/Pt and Au/Pd alloys, respectively. (41, 42) Hasegawa’s group used STM to study surface state electron density on large Pd islands on both Au and Cu surfaces. (43, 44) Canzian et al. calculated that for a Pd/Cu{111} alloy, small amounts of Pd (up to 0.2 ML) would alloy almost entirely within the top two layers of the surface at temperatures up to 600 K. Stensgaard and co-workers found that single Pd atoms in the surface layer of a Cu host imaged as a 0.02 nm protrusion, whereas Pd atoms in the subsurface layer imaged as depressions. (27)
By controlling the temperature of the Cu(111) crystal during Pd deposition, Pd atoms were selectively placed in the surface, subsurface, and bulk of the Cu crystal. (26, 27) For lower temperature depositions (ca. 350 K) more Pd (90%) was incorporated in the top surface layer, whereas small amounts (10%) were seen to occupy subsurface sites (Figure 3a). Higher temperature depositions (ca. 500 K) lead to the majority of the Pd (70%) occupying subsurface sites, with smaller amounts (30%) in the surface layer (Figure 3b). This trend reflects the higher surface free energy of Pd compared to Cu (surface free energy Cu = 1.85 J m−2, Pd = 2.05 J m−2). The sample in Figure 3a with mainly surface Pd is actually metastable; annealing beyond its formation temperature lead to Pd migrating to the subsurface and bulk sites. (26) Interestingly, the Pd atoms substituted into the Cu surface with very little geometric perturbation of the Cu atoms. While Pd atoms show a height difference from their Cu neighbors in topographic images, the spacing between Pd and Cu atoms was found to be very close to the bulk and surface Cu−Cu spacing (0.256 nm) at 0.25 ± 0.01 nm.
Figure 3
Figure 3. STM images show that both surface and subsurface Pd atoms are observed in the Cu{111} surface at a wide range of deposition temperatures. Subsurface Pd appears as depressions perturbing the appearance of up to seven surface atoms (black arrows), while surface Pd appears as single atom protrusions (white arrows). Low temperature depositions, such as in panel a at 350 K, yield more surface Pd atoms (90% surface vs 10% subsurface Pd) than higher temperature depositions, such as in panel b at 500 K, where subsurface Pd atoms are more prevalent (30% surface vs 70% subsurface Pd). Both images are of a 0.01 ML Pd dose. (Imaging conditions: (a) I = 0.9 nA, Vtip = −0.04 V, 78 K, z-range = 70 pm, (b) I = 0.4 nA, Vtip = −0.08 V, 78 K, z-range = 80 pm.)
Another important point is revealed by images like those in Figure 3. After examining many such images, it is obvious that there is no long-range order in these alloys and that the only order that exists is a distinct lack of nearest neighbor Pd atoms. (27, 45, 46) Stensgaard and co-workers performed pair correlation functions on STM images of surface Pd in Cu{111} and revealed that the Pd pair spacings were completely random except for nearest neighbor positions, which are never populated. (27) Theoretical studies have explained that the driving force for the nearest neighbor coordination of Pd atoms by Cu is a stronger heterometallic Cu−Pd bond than the corresponding Cu−Cu and Pd−Pd bonds. (16) This difference in bond strength results in a complete lack of nearest neighbor Pd atom pairs. This effect is relevant over the range of temperatures at which the Pd/Cu catalysts operate. Therefore, elucidation of the geometric, electronic, and reactive properties of Pd atoms locally coordinated by Cu is a crucial step toward understanding the fundamental workings of these systems.
The electronic structure of metal surfaces is a key factor in dictating how strongly adsorbates bind and how easily bonds within the molecules can be broken. Norskov and co-workers formulated the d-band model which correlates the separation of the center of the d-band and the Fermi level with adsorbate binding strength. (47-50) The closer the center of the d-band to the Fermi level, the stronger the binding to the surface and the greater the ease with which bonds within a molecule can be broken. Key factors that influence the position of the d-band center include metal type, coordination number, strain, and ligand effects. In alloys, both strain and ligand effects play crucial roles in determining reactivity. Therefore, atomic-scale studies of the electronic structure of alloys will allow important factors in their reactivity to be measured, quantified and compared with predictions.
Using differential conductance (dI/dV) point spectroscopy, the LDOS of individual Pd atoms both in and under the surface were recorded 1 eV above and below EF. Many spectra (>100) were taken over many days (>10) with multiple tip states (>10). The dI/dV spectra presented in the paper were collected on one day but are averaged over multiple Cu, surface, and subsurface Pd atoms within a given area. Changes in the STM tip state were very noticeable not only in the topographic images (which were taken concurrently with dI/dV spectra measurements), but also large spikes were observed in dI/dV spectra when a tip change occurred due to saturation of the signal from the lock-in amplifier. In order to ensure that all data was recorded with the same STM tip state, dI/dV spectra were always taken multiple times alternatively above Pd and Cu atoms. If the tip had changed within the set of measurements, then the Pd spectra at the beginning and end of the set would differ and the data set would be discarded.
The fact that dI/dV spectra of both the host Cu atoms and inserted Pd atoms can be measured with exactly the same tip allows a direct comparison of the electronic structure of both atomic sites with subnanometer resolution. These spectra were taken for surface and subsurface Pd on the Cu{111} crystal and compared to the spectra from Cu atoms in the alloyed surface (see Figure 4). At first glance all of the spectra look almost identical. Therefore, to first approximation, isolated Pd atoms are electronically identical to their Cu host. However, as all of the spectra in Figure 4 were taken using the same STM tip, the Cu background could be subtracted from the Pd spectra to reveal subtle differences in the LDOS of the Pd atoms as seen on the right of Figure 4.
Figure 4
Figure 4. dI/dV point spectra taken for 0.01 ML Pd/Cu{111}. Pd spectra for surface Pd vs subsurface Pd were compared with spectra from nearby Cu atoms. Subtraction of the Cu background spectra from the Pd spectra shows deviations from the bare Cu spectra near the surface state (about −0.45 eV for Cu).
The largest difference in the Pd spectra can be seen near the surface state maxima of Cu{111}, which occurs at an energy of −0.45 eV. (51) The background subtraction spectra reveal that both surface and subsurface Pd atoms have a depleted LDOS centered around −0.45 eV. As this energy corresponds to filled states, the Pd atoms therefore carry a slight positive charge. By using the Wigner-Seitz radius of Cu (190 Å2/electron), and integrating the dI/dV curves over the energy range of the Cu{111} surface state, the charge transfer from Pd to Cu can be tentatively estimated. (52) Using this method the charge transfer between Pd and Cu atoms was found to be 0.010 ± 0.001 e− for surface Pd atoms and 0.004 ± 0.001 e− for subsurface Pd atoms. The direction of charge transfer is somewhat nonintuitive. Given the work functions of Cu (4.65 eV) and Pd (5.12 eV), one would naively expect the Pd to acquire charge as opposed to the reverse. As discussed in the introduction, the UPS work of Martensson et al. (33) actually showed an increase in electron density just below the Fermi level as Pd/Cu alloys became increasingly Pd rich. In the present case the charge transfer is found to be from the Pd to the Cu atoms, as seen by the depleted electron density of the Pd in the subtracted differential conductance spectra (Figure 4).
An important point to remember is that this study is of Pd in the dilute limit, and that the Cu{111} surface state electrons are clearly affected by the presence of Pd. For this reason dI/dV imaging was used to spatially view the LDOS of the Pd/Cu{111} surface at specific energies. Topography STM images contain an average of the LDOS between the Fermi energy and the imaging voltage. dI/dV imaging allows for a smaller sliver of the LDOS to be measured and plotted spatially in an image. Figure 5 shows topography and dI/dV images of both a clean Cu{111} sample and one with 0.01 ML Pd. The Cu/Pd alloy sample has Pd atoms in both the surface and subsurface regions of the ascending step edges.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Topographic and dI/dV images for Cu{111} and 0.01 ML Pd/Cu{111}. In the bare metal system, standing wave patterns are only seen emanating from the step edge. In the alloyed system, the Pd atoms in the Cu crystal are the most dominant scattering centers. (Imaging conditions: Vtip = 0.1 V, 7 K, I = 1.5 nA, for all images and the z-range = 2−3 pm for the topography images.)
The topographic image of a bare Cu{111} surface in the upper left side of Figure 5 shows electron standing waves emanating from a step edge. These standing waves are seen even more clearly in the corresponding dI/dV image because the color contrast associated with topographic features like the step edge is no longer present in the dI/dV image. Images in the lower half of Figure 5 show an equivalent area of Cu{111} but now with 0.01 ML of Pd incorporated into the surface and subsurface layers. This Pd incorporation leads to drastic differences both topographically and electronically as compared to the bare Cu{111}. The topography image shows that the upper terrace is no longer flat due to Pd incorporation. The dI/dV image reveals that the dominant scatterer is no longer the step edge; it is the isolated Pd atoms themselves. Such surface state electron scattering is a possible mechanism by which Pd atoms can be depleted of charge. However, this study shows that some degree of electron scattering can be observed over a fairly wide energy range (∼0.5 eV) and the fact that Pd atoms are depleted of charge in a much narrower range of energies (∼0.1 eV) suggests that electron scattering does not give rise to this charge transfer effect. We suggest that further modeling work is required to fully explain the subtle electronic differences between Pd and Cu we measure experimentally.
Conclusions
The most stable surface compositions of Pd/Cu alloys are composed of ∼100% Cu and, due to their larger size, any Pd atoms in the surface layer exist as isolated monomers surrounded by Cu atoms. (26, 27) Therefore, an understanding of the atomic-scale structure and electronic properties of these isolated Pd atoms is crucial for understanding their reactivity. While previous studies utilizing a variety of spectroscopies have revealed the ensemble properties of Pd/Cu alloy systems, this work employed LT-STM imaging and differential conductance spectroscopy to elucidate the local surface composition and electronic structure of individual Pd and Cu atoms in a Pd/Cu{111} surface alloy. By using dI/dV spectroscopy, a direct comparison of the LDOS of isolated Pd atoms and their Cu host was drawn and the charge transfer between Pd and Cu over an energy range 1 eV above and below the Fermi level was quantified. This work provides insight into the electronic properties of an important catalytic surface and reveals that isolated Pd atoms in a Cu{111} surface are almost electronically identical to their Cu host, except for a very small charge depletion from the Pd near the peak in the Cu surface state. dI/dV imaging revealed that isolated Pd atoms serve as scattering centers for the surface state electrons of the Cu{111} surface. This work shows that STM spectroscopy is an ideal method for elucidating the atomic-scale electronic structure of metal alloys. Further research is aimed at extending the energy range of the dI/dV spectroscopy in order to elucidate the full d-band structure of these catalytically important alloys and relate the results to theory.

Figure 1
Figure 1. STM image of bare Cu{111}, which is characterized by wide, flat terraces separated by monatomic step edges, where the yellow terrace is topographically the highest area. The inset shows the hexagonal surface symmetry of Cu atoms in the Cu{111} surface. (Imaging conditions: I = 10 pA, Vtip = −0.5 V, 78 K, z-range = 500 pm. Inset: I = 2 nA, Vtip = 0.07 V, 78 K, z-range = 40 pm.)
Figure 2
Figure 2. STM image of Cu{111} after deposition of 0.01 ML Pd. Pd is incorporated into the Cu{111} surface via ascending step edges to form “brims”. The yellow terrace is the topographically highest area. (Imaging conditions: I = 0.1 nA, Vtip = 0.4 V, 78 K, z-range = 700 pm.)
Figure 3
Figure 3. STM images show that both surface and subsurface Pd atoms are observed in the Cu{111} surface at a wide range of deposition temperatures. Subsurface Pd appears as depressions perturbing the appearance of up to seven surface atoms (black arrows), while surface Pd appears as single atom protrusions (white arrows). Low temperature depositions, such as in panel a at 350 K, yield more surface Pd atoms (90% surface vs 10% subsurface Pd) than higher temperature depositions, such as in panel b at 500 K, where subsurface Pd atoms are more prevalent (30% surface vs 70% subsurface Pd). Both images are of a 0.01 ML Pd dose. (Imaging conditions: (a) I = 0.9 nA, Vtip = −0.04 V, 78 K, z-range = 70 pm, (b) I = 0.4 nA, Vtip = −0.08 V, 78 K, z-range = 80 pm.)
Figure 4
Figure 4. dI/dV point spectra taken for 0.01 ML Pd/Cu{111}. Pd spectra for surface Pd vs subsurface Pd were compared with spectra from nearby Cu atoms. Subtraction of the Cu background spectra from the Pd spectra shows deviations from the bare Cu spectra near the surface state (about −0.45 eV for Cu).
Figure 5
Figure 5. Topographic and dI/dV images for Cu{111} and 0.01 ML Pd/Cu{111}. In the bare metal system, standing wave patterns are only seen emanating from the step edge. In the alloyed system, the Pd atoms in the Cu crystal are the most dominant scattering centers. (Imaging conditions: Vtip = 0.1 V, 7 K, I = 1.5 nA, for all images and the z-range = 2−3 pm for the topography images.)
