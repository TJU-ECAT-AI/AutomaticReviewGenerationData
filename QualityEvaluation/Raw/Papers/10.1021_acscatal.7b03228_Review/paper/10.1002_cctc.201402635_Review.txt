Formation of Intermetallic Compounds by Reactive Metal–Support Interaction: A Frequently Encountered Phenomenon in Catalysis
Graphical Abstract
Strong and stronger: The origin and manifestation of the reactive metal–support interaction (RMSI) as a new type of metal–support interaction are highlighted in selected examples and the structural and catalytic consequences discussed. This new term more accurately describes the most extreme form of metal–support interaction, that is, intermetallic compound formation following high-temperature reduction of oxide-supported metal catalysts.
Abstract
This Review discusses the structural and catalytic aspects of the recently introduced reactive metal–support interaction. This special term was coined to account for the inability of the original concept of the strong metal–support interaction to accurately describe the structural, compositional, and electronic changes frequently occurring in oxide-supported metal particle catalysts at very high temperatures upon reduction in hydrogen, in many cases leading to intermetallic compound or substitutional alloy formation. This inaccuracy predominantly refers to the requirement of full reversibility upon oxidation and mild reduction for a “strong” metal–support interaction. A close look at the formation of oxide-supported intermetallic compounds upon high-temperature reduction reveals that these compounds are very common in catalysis and the situation is much more complex compared to unsupported intermetallic compounds due to the presence of the intermetallic compound–oxide interface.
1. Introduction
Bi- or multimetallic systems, and among them intermetallic compounds, represent an interesting class of materials in catalysis due to their structural and electronic properties, rendering them promising catalysts for a range of reduction or oxidation reactions.1, 2 A multimetallic system might be either a structurally well-defined intermetallic compound (defined as a chemical compound of two or more metals with a crystal structure different from the constituting metals; characteristic is the presence of covalent and/or ionic bonds) or a substitutional alloy (defined by a material composed of at least two elements as a single- or multiphase solid solution), depending on the corresponding phase diagram.1 Whereas recent experimental and quantum mechanical studies focus on the knowledge-based matching of intermetallic compounds and catalytic reactions,1 a thorough literature review reveals that intermetallic compounds are much more frequently encountered than previously assumed (for a comprehensive overview of the use of intermetallic compounds in catalysis, we refer to Refs. 1, 2). This comprises instances of intermetallic compounds deliberately prepared to exploit distinct structural or electronic properties (e.g., with the well-known preparation of the supported intermetallic compound ZnPd for CO2-selective steam reforming3–6) and materials in which unintended intermetallic compound formation occurs as a result of their preparation or application under catalytic reaction conditions.7–12 Notably, the latter case represents the overwhelming majority of intermetallic compounds discussed in the catalytic community. Supported intermetallic compounds are prepared deliberately either through 1) promotion or modification of an oxide-supported metal (particle) with a second metal1 by reaction with a highly reactive reagent or 2) the oxide support itself taking part in the formation during the preparation of the intermetallic compound.1 It is the latter example, which often creates the structurally and electronically most complex scenarios, on which this Review is focused. Adding the metal atoms of the (usually oxidic) support as a reactant in the preparation of intermetallic compounds requires in most cases the reduction of the oxide at elevated temperatures by hydrogen (explicitly discussed for example, in Refs. 13–15). There are many examples of this kind in the literature with seemingly endless combinations of noble metal and oxide support.1, 13–158 The chemical properties of the supporting oxide usually determine the requirements for intermetallic compound formation under given reduction conditions and are in most cases the source of complexity.1, 13–15, 159 This is mainly due to the general presence of metal–support interactions and especially “strong metal–support interactions” (SMSI).160–164 The latter term, coined by Tauster et al., is reserved for structural rearrangements and electronic changes occurring exclusively upon reduction in hydrogen at elevated temperatures in the presence of easily reduced oxides such as TiO2 or CeO2.159 Hard-to-reduce oxides such as SiO2 or Al2O3 were excluded. Although this appears to be a convenient term to also describe the formation of intermetallic compounds from supported metal nanoparticles, its use does not come without strings attached and finally led to the introduction of the new term “reactive metal–support interaction”.1 Reactive metal–support interaction refers to a chemical reaction process occurring on the metal–oxide interface but under extremely harsh conditions (i.e., at very high temperatures upon reduction in hydrogen), in many cases leading to the formation of intermetallic compounds or alloys. To classify a metal–support interaction as “strong”, three strict requirements must be met: 1) the catalyst shows conventional chemical behavior at low reduction temperatures, 2) upon increasing the reduction temperature, the chemisorption capability of the dispersed metal phase towards “classic” probe molecules such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide is disturbed along with substantial changes in its catalytic behavior, and, most importantly, 3) the phenomenon must be fully reversible, that is, reoxidation at an appropriate temperature followed by mild rereduction reestablishes the catalytic behavior prior to entering the SMSI state.159 The strong metal–support interaction is thought to originate from perturbations associated with electronic interactions (also localized) between the dispersed metal phase and reduced oxide support and loss of active metal area by encapsulation, decoration, and support migration (i.e., the active centers for chemisorption at the metal surface are blocked at high reduction temperatures by partial coverage by a thin layer of the reduced oxide support).162, 165 A tentative overview of the effects of the degree of metal–support interaction on chemisorption, catalytic patterns, and structure, including as an extreme case the formation of intermetallic compounds, is presented in Figure 1.

Focusing on the intermetallic compound and/or alloy formation as the most extreme case of “strong” metal–support interaction, requirement 3) is not usually fulfilled. Decomposition of intermetallic compounds is only possible by using harsh oxidation treatments, which do not restore the structural and electronic properties to those before entering the intermetallic state.1 Although the term “strong metal–support interaction” is therefore misleading and should be avoided, its structural and electronic manifestations offer a convenient pathway to discuss the inherent complexity of oxide-supported intermetallic compounds. This complexity might include both structural and catalytic aspects. For oxidation reactions, this is in most cases due to the presence of an intermetallic compound–oxide interface, which forms on entering the intermetallic state upon reduction. The reaction between the supported metal and the metal resulting from the reduction of the support leads to a set of questions, which are important for the properties of the materials: Which new phase(s) form? Which crystallographic and electronic structure results? Do the particles realize unusual particle morphologies? Do they grow topotactically? Is the intermetallic compound stable under reaction conditions? How does the reducibility of the support affect the intermetallic compound formation and does the preparation of the catalyst affect the extent of intermetallic compound formation?
The importance of addressing these questions becomes clear after considering the effects on the catalytic properties, such as changes in catalytic activity or selectivity upon entering the intermetallic compound state. Also, the influence of the newly created interface (i.e., are special sites at the interface created upon entering the intermetallic state?) on the catalytic properties might be important.
By comparative studies of supported and unsupported intermetallic compounds, the question of whether the intermetallic compounds are the catalytically active and selective phases or just a part of a larger synergistic catalytic entity can be investigated, answering also the question of whether the supporting oxide contributes to the catalytic properties. In the larger context, the question of which reactions would be influenced by intermetallic formation can be answered.
A very important issue, also concerning the judgement of whether a strong metal–support interaction in a strict definition of the term or a reactive metal–support interaction is present, is related to the general formation mechanism of the intermetallic compound. Considering that the initial pre-intermetallic state of the catalyst is oxide-supported metal particles, four possible mechanisms are discussed in literature:
Equation (1) A direct reaction between the noble metal and the oxide to the corresponding intermetallic compound and the associated noble metal oxide, for example:21
(1)
Equation (2) A surface-specific reaction at the oxide–metal contact via chemisorbed oxygen on the metal surface, for example:21
(2)
Equation (3) A reaction via hydroxylated surface species, for example:101
(3)
Equation (4) A direct reaction by reduction of the oxide in hydrogen, for example:26, 101
(4)
Notably, the first two mechanisms do not require hydrogen for formation of the intermetallic compound. Indeed, the most crucial component determining the pathway of intermetallic compound formation is the supporting oxide, and, more specifically, its thermodynamic stability and the resulting reducibility. The first two mechanisms have been solely discussed for the hydrogen-free formation of MSi intermetallic compounds by simple thermal annealing. Furthermore, due to the very high formation enthalpy of SiO2, the first mechanism has been discarded explicitly for Rh-SiO221 and Cu-SiO2 systems.25 In contrast, the prevalence of a mechanism that includes at least partial reduction of the support is nowadays favored and has been stated explicitly for Pt on SiO2,13–15, 29 Al2O3,13, 14 CeO2,13, 14 VOx,94 and TiO2,113 Pd on SiO2,56, 101 and Rh on SiO2,26 CeO2,53 ZnO,56 and V2O3.54, 55, 76 Surface-specific mechanisms have been held accountable for the formation of CuSi25 and RhSi.21 The formation of the intermetallic compounds most probably includes the following reaction steps: 1) reduction of the oxidic support in the vicinity of the supported particles by hydrogen activated on the latter, 2) diffusion of these metallic species into the noble metal lattice and 3) formation of the respective intermetallic compound(s). For efficient formation of intermetallic compounds, steady removal of the formed water is a prerequisite, as is effective hydrogen activation on the noble metal surface.13–15 Notably, evidence for this reaction mechanism has been collected for Pt particles on SiO2 (Figure 2).15 Parts A and B of Figure 2 show Pt particles on SiO2 in the as-grown state (part A) and after reduction at 873 K (part B), in which a and b denote reconstructed and irregular intermetallic Pt3Si and Pt12Si5 particles, respectively. In this special case, electron energy loss spectroscopy (part C) reveals not only clear indications of SiO2 reduction but also clear differences in the extent of reduction as a function of distance from the metal particles. Thus, SiO2 far away from the metal particles (and hence, far away from dissociatively activated hydrogen) only shows minor signs of reduction, whereas SiO2 close to the metal surface shows clear indications of distortion of the SiO2 building blocks by hydrogen reduction.15 The necessity for dissociatively activated hydrogen has also been stressed by Lamber explicitly for the formation of Pt2Si compounds.29 Notably, a possible reaction mechanism must also include kinetic diffusion limitations of the second metal phase to account for the formation of compound mixtures and particle size effects, as observed in a number of intermetallic compound systems (for details we refer to the following sections).

To highlight the possibility and feasibility of intermetallic compound formation, we will focus briefly on the thermodynamics of the Pt/SiO2 system discussed in Refs. 13, 14. For the reaction shown in Equation (5), the standard reaction enthalpy at 900 K is +393 kJ mol−1 (this can be calculated simply from the formation enthalpies of the reactants, including the one for Pt3Si, which can be calculated by using DFT to be −115.9 kJ mol−1).13, 14
(5)
The standard formation entropy of the intermetallic compound is not known, but it is possible to give a rough estimate from the standard formation entropy of the isostructural Cu3Au compound (+238.6 J mol−1). The free reaction enthalpy at 900 K is therefore +178 kJ mol−1, resulting in an equilibrium constant of 4.5×10−11, indicating a highly endergonic reaction. Under the given experimental conditions (reactor volume 16 mL),13, 14 a water pressure of approximately 10−3 bar is built up at a hydrogen pressure of 1 bar. However, as the reduction experiments are performed under flowing conditions, the water is permanently removed, thus, the water partial pressure is kept on a low level and the reaction forced towards the products. Water formation occurs predominantly at the Pt–SiO2 interface by reaction of diffusing atomic hydrogen with the SiO2 substrate. The high formation energy and high stability of the intermetallic compounds formed also applies to compounds of differing stoichiometry, for example, −127.8 kJ mol−1 for a PtSi phase. Similar arguments also hold for the corresponding Pt3Al (equilibrium constant 1.3×10−9)13, 14 and Pt3Ce (equilibrium constant 2.4×10−6)13, 14 compounds. In all these cases, classical thermodynamics does not limit intermetallic compound formation because the experimental setup allows for permanent removal of reactant water.
As for the thermodynamics of supporting oxide reduction, this is basically dominated by the standard formation enthalpies of the oxides under question: for the Al2O3 and CeO2 examples discussed above, these enthalpies are −1651 kJ mol−1 and −1085 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating that intermetallic compound formation requires higher temperatures on Al2O3, corroborating the experimental results. Supporting the noble metals on oxides with smaller formation enthalpies, for example, the use of ZnO, GeO2, or Fe2O3 results in much lower temperatures required for the formation of intermetallic compounds.
This Review tries to summarize the present dispersed and far from systematic knowledge on the preparation of supported intermetallic compounds via the reactive metal–support interaction. In addition, the complexity of such systems is highlighted, also addressing structural and catalytic aspects in selected examples. Cross-correlations to unsupported intermetallic compounds are attempted whenever applicable to highlight the differences and common features.
2. Formation of Intermetallic Compounds
To highlight the widespread presence of intermetallic compounds, Table 1 gives a compact overview of combinations known to date of transition metals and oxides, for which, after a high-temperature treatment in hydrogen, the formation of intermetallic compounds has been reported. By far the most data are found for the classical catalytically active noble metal particles Pt, Rh, and Pd, much less data for Ni, Cu, Ru, and Au. The examples include only supported nanoparticulate systems, either as classical impregnated catalysts or thin film model systems. Notably, regarding the stability of the intermetallic phases discussed below, the TEM work contains exclusively ex situ-obtained data. This poses the general stability question when the formed intermetallic compounds are exposed to air; changes their structure and cross-correlations to catalytic data are established. Although in situ or, better still, operando, characterizations are highly desirable, these data are not available to date. However, most of the intermetallic compounds need very harsh reoxidation temperatures for decomposition (T≥673 K; see section 3.1.3.). An obvious exception concerns intermetallic compounds with bi-functional synergism prevalent in the working state of the catalyst between the support and the intermetallic compound particles, but even in these cases, the working state is sometimes preserved upon transfer (e.g., ZnPd on ZnO108).

2.1. Platinum
For systems including Pt particles, formation of intermetallic compounds is a fairly common feature, both on easily reducible and hard-to-reduce oxides. On CeO2, only two distinct intermetallic compounds are observed, CePt313, 14 and CePt5.11, 20, 44, 45, 89 Whereas the former has only been observed in thin film systems after reduction in hydrogen at 873 K,13, 14 the latter has been reported more frequently.11, 20, 44, 45, 89 As a common feature, CePt5 is only observed at reduction temperatures of 1173 K and higher. CePt5 has also been reported for Tb-doped Pt/CeO2 systems.89 Ce-Pt compound formation has been reported at and above 750 K in thin film Pt samples90 and has been held responsible for catalyst deactivation upon reduction in hydrogen between 473 and 773 K.91 For Pt on Ga2O3, reduction at 773 K on an impregnated catalyst yields the intermetallic compounds Ga3Pt5 and Ga5.4Pt10.6.3, 6 The system Pt/ZnO is a very interesting one, as different intermetallic compounds are observed if different Zn-containing supports are used. On Pt/ZnO, only the intermetallic compound ZnPt is encountered, typically after high-temperature reduction between 473 and 773 K.3, 6, 48, 49, 76, 116, 117, 128, 133, 137, 146 For Pt particles supported on an Al-Zn spinel, both ZnPt and ZnPt3 have been observed,18, 92 depending on the reduction/annealing temperature. ZnPt is found after reduction at 830–850 K in hydrogen, whereas treatments at lower temperatures or oxidative regeneration lead to the formation of the Pt-rich ZnPt3 phase.18, 92 Use of SiO2 or Al2O3 as a support for metal particles demonstrated for the first time the strong metal–support interaction with hard-to-reduce oxides. Reduction at high temperatures (773–1173 K) led to the formation of the intermetallic compounds PtSi, Pt2Si, cubic and monoclinic Pt3Si, and Pt12Si5.13–15, 29, 39, 40, 47 Similar to SiO2, intermetallic compound or alloy formation with participation of Al2O3 needs very harsh reduction conditions at and above 773 K. Al-Pt alloys and the intermetallic compound AlPt3 were reported.13, 14, 25, 31, 33, 157 Reduction of Pt/SnO2 and Pt/In2O3 catalysts at 673 and 523 K caused the formation of the intermetallic compounds SnPt, Sn2Pt, Sn4Pt, and In2Pt, respectively.3, 6, 93, 140 On Pt/V2O3 catalysts, the ordering of the intermetallic compound Pt3V, prepared by reduction at 773 K, could be triggered by preoxidation treatments prior to reduction.94 In addition, by using TiO2 as the support, electron microscopy revealed the formation of TiPt intermetallic compounds after high-temperature reduction95 and a TiPt3 phase after reduction at 823 K.113 TiPt3 has also been observed by Beard et al. after reduction at 973 K.114 Direct Pt-Ti interactions were detected after reduction at 773 K by Belton et al.96
2.2. Rhodium
Compared to oxide-supported Pt and Pd particles, the formation of intermetallic compounds in Rh-containing systems has scarcely been investigated. Only for four oxides, that is, CeO2, SiO2, TiO2, and V2O3, has intermetallic formation after high-temperature reduction been reported. CeRh3 particles were obtained after reduction at 773 K on a Rh/CeO2 thin film catalyst,49 Rh2Si26 and Rh3Si particles21 on powder samples after reduction at 1223 and 850 K. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements were used to identify not only direct Rh-Ti interactions after reduction at 773 K,97 but also distinct TiRh3 and TiRh intermetallic compounds at 623 K.30 By using V2O3 as the support, Rh3V, RhV3, and Rh5V3 intermetallic compounds have been obtained at temperatures of 673 K and higher.54, 55, 76
2.3. Palladium
A closer look at the literature reveals that the most data are available by far for oxide-supported Pd particles. † This indicates both the number of different intermetallic compounds formed and that the system has been scrutinized particularly from structural, electronic, and catalytic points of view in the last decade. † Pd/ZnO is by far the most experimentally and theoretically studied system. Intermetallic compound formation has been observed with participation of easily reducible transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O3 or V2O594), refractory oxides (e.g., SiO2,24, 27, 36, 37 Al2O3,57 or GeO212), or with oxides giving rise to special catalytic applications (e.g., methanol steam reforming and selective hydrogenation of acetylene: Ga2O3,3–6, 50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 74, 75, 100, 136 ZnO, † In2O3,3–6, 107, 136 or SnO2;12 and the reverse water–gas shift reaction: ZnO134, 135). More or less well-ordered Pd3V is obtained after high-temperature reduction treatments in hydrogen at and above 773 K.94 Pd/SiO2 systems are particularly well studied with respect to the metal–support interaction at high temperatures. Moss et al. explained the decrease in specific activity for benzene hydrogenation for a Pd/SiO2 catalyst upon raising the reduction temperature to 873 K by the formation of an intermetallic compound.35 A metal–support interaction and Pd2Si intermetallic compound formation was also reported by Lamber et al.101 and Penner et al.56 after reduction at 873 K. In the former case, microdiffraction showed an oriented growth of the Pd2Si compound with respect to the Pd matrix. A variety of different Pd-silicides (notably, Pd3Si, Pd4Si, and Pd5Si) in strongly reduced Pd/SiO2 samples, showing different catalytic properties, were also detected by XRD and TEM analyses.24, 36, 37, 101 Equally, the interaction of Pd particles with reduced Al2O3 supports yielded the intermetallic compounds AlPd and Al3Pd4.41, 57, 102 Recent interest in preparing CO2-selective methanol steam reforming catalysts resulted in the formation of a number of Pd-based intermetallic compounds on “unusual” oxide supports, namely ZnO, Ga2O3, In2O3, SnO2, and GeO2. Whereas the intermetallic compound formation, at least at low reduction temperatures (i.e., 573 K) for ZnO and GeO2, is relatively simple and gives rise to ZnPd † and GePd2,12 the situation is more complex for the other oxides. Over Ga2O3, a large variety of different intermetallic compounds with compositions from GaPd2 and Ga2Pd5 to GaPd and Ga5Pd have all been reported on thin film and impregnated Pd/Ga2O3 systems3–6, 50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 85, 100 after reduction at and above 523 K. Particularly well-studied is the supported intermetallic compound GaPd2,50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 100 which can also be prepared by decomposition of hydrotalcite precursors.74, 75 In this regard, the formation of the intermetallic compound has also been studied with respect to structure and catalysis over different polymorphic forms of Ga2O3.64, 100 The intermetallic compound InPd was obtained after heating thin films and impregnated Pd/In2O3 samples at 523 K in hydrogen.3–6, 12 In3Pd2 was obtained only on the impregnated system after reduction at 773 K, followed by In3Pd.12 In general, intermetallic formation over Pd/In2O3 is influenced heavily by the reducibility of single-phase In2O3 to the metallic In state. For the thin film sample, InPd formation already occurs upon preparation before the reduction treatment.12 Reduction of Pd/SnO2 samples induces formation of an array of Pd-Sn intermetallic compounds, including Pd2Sn, PdSn, and Pd3Sn2.12, 41 As with Pd/Ga2O3, intermetallic compound formation in the impregnated Pd/GeO2 system offers the advantage of convenient study of the influence of the structure and chemical state of the oxide support. In fact, GePd2 formation by using Pd particles on tetragonal GeO2 yielded only GePd2, but those on hexagonal GeO2 a mixture of GePd2 and GePd. This was explained tentatively by reference to the higher solubility of hexagonal GeO2 in water giving rise to an enhanced metal–support contact area upon catalyst preparation and in turn, more efficient intermetallic compound formation.12 The properties of the prototypical intermetallic compound–oxide system that has evolved in the last decade, Pd/ZnO (and ZnPd/ZnO after reduction), should not be discussed in detail at this point, since comprehensive reviews for almost all aspects of its chemical and electronic structure and catalytic properties already exist.86, 98, 99, 103 However, mixtures of ZnPd, Zn3Pd2, and ZnPd2 have also been obtained by interaction between Pd and ZnO, depending on the synthesis conditions.1, 79 The Pd/CeO2 system has been scrutinized in detail under comparable reducing conditions, but no signs of a well-defined intermetallic compound have been observed up to 1180 K (over 20 h), neither by XRD, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), nor high-resolution (HR)TEM analyses. A solid solution of Ce in the Pd structure was proposed instead.59 Similarly, Kępiński et al. discuss a substitutional alloy Ce-Pd exhibiting a face-centered cubic structure with a slightly larger lattice constant that Pd metal, formed at 773 K and above. Interestingly, the authors infer the influence of a suppressed metal–support interface due to increased crystallite size of both Pd and CeO2 at higher reduction temperatures.111, 112 A Pd-Cr alloy phase has been observed after a methanol decomposition reaction by using XRD.126 0 1 2 3
2.4. Nickel
Information on the metal–support interaction and intermetallic compound formation in Ni-oxide systems is limited to date to the Ni-CeO2, Ni-TiO2, and Ni-SiO2 systems. CeNi and CeNi2 were observed after the hydrogenation of benzene at temperatures of approximately 500 K.8 In addition, Ni3Si was observed on a Ni/SiO2 catalyst after heating in hydrogen at 850 K.23 Martin et al. interpreted the decrease in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activity at 1120 K as a result of the formation of Ni-silicide species.104 Praliaud and Martin inferred the presence of a Ni79Si11 compound from magnetic measurements at 1180 K.22 Ni/TiO2 reported by Chettibi et al. represented a complex system: whereas radiation-treated catalysts showed the presence of Ni2Ti and Ni3Ti phases, in the simple calcined and hydrogen-reduced sample, a Ni5TiO7 compound was found. This was attributed to the contribution of the persisting NiO phase during reduction. A higher cyclohexane selectivity in benzene hydrogenation for the radiation-treated catalyst resulted in turn.154
2.5. Copper
Formation of a Cu0.61Si0.39 intermetallic compound was observed after the decomposition of methanol over a Cu/ZnO catalyst.9 A copper silicide with unknown composition was postulated by Van den Oetelaar after a thermal treatment of a Cu/SiO2 catalyst under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 873 K.25
2.6. Gold
The single formation of an Au-Cu bimetallic phase has been observed for complex Au/CuO/TiO2 catalysts, which were formed by activation in air at 573 K and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at 573 K.16 A report by Liu et al. demonstrated for the first time the reactive metal–support interaction in nanorod Au/ZnO systems, that is, after reduction at 573 K in hydrogen; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements indicated the formation of an Au-Zn alloy phase.105
2.7. Ruthenium
Studies on the catalytic combustion of ethyl acetate over Ru/SnO2 catalysts revealed the formation of a Sn7Ru3 intermetallic compound after prereduction at 673 K (for 0.5 h) in hydrogen, as evidenced by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and HRTEM analyses. Interestingly, the large Sn7Ru3 particles were present in a characteristic core–shell structure, with a well-crystallized intermetallic compound core and an amorphous Sn-enriched shell. The core shell structure was proposed to arise from a phase separation of the catalyst after contact with air.138
3. Structural and Catalytic Aspects in Selected Examples
3.1. Structural aspects
3.1.1. Influence of the oxide’s reducibility on the formation of intermetallic compounds
The discussion on the influence of the oxide’s reducibility on the formation of intermetallic compounds represents one of the core topics in reactive and strong metal–support interactions. In the early days, the “strong” metal–support interaction was solely assigned to easily reducible transition metal oxides, such as TiO2 or CeO2, capable of forming sub-stoichiometric oxide species.159 Hard-to-reduce oxides, such as (as extreme cases) SiO2 or Al2O3, were excluded from entering a state of strong metal–support interaction. Recent studies, however, showed that this mutual discrimination is no longer valid. Even SiO2 or Al2O3, albeit at higher reduction temperatures, were found to enter the state of reactive metal–support interaction. Here, these comparably harsh reduction treatments did not lead to a collapse of the original structures of metal nor support. Furthermore, the metal species was sometimes needed for epitaxial growth of the intermetallic compound (for details, see section 3.1.2.). TEM analysis of thin film Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 samples after entering the intermetallic compound state directly revealed the structural stability of especially the support.13, 14 Combinations for which this concept has been explicitly proven include Pt and Pd, on both SiO2 and Al2O3.13–15, 24, 27, 29, 35–37, 39, 40, 56, 158 Although this of course already implies that the reducibility of the corresponding oxides does have an influence on the formation of intermetallic compounds, a more catchy example includes Pd particles on In2O3 (Figure 3).12 Driven by the abilities of the intermetallic compound InPd to selectively catalyze the methanol steam reforming reaction towards CO2, the formation of InPd is heavily influenced on the one hand by the reduction behavior of In2O3 and on the other hand by the special preparation pathway. In due course, Pd particles conventionally prepared by incipient wetness impregnation on In2O3 (TEM image, Figure 3 A) enter a state of reactive metal–support interaction at approximately 573 K and InPd is thereby formed (TEM image, Figure 3 B; the corresponding XRD diffraction patterns are highlighted in part C). InPd is subsequently transformed into In3Pd2 at higher reduction temperatures. In contrast, if InPd is formed via a thin film model system, prepared by growing epitaxial Pd particles on NaCl(0 0 1) and subsequent embedding in a nm-thick film of In2O3 at 573 K (TEM image, Figure 3 D), compound formation already occurs during the preparation process (SAED pattern, Figure 3 E). The reason for this rather peculiar feature is the outspokenly well-pronounced reducibility of single-phase In2O3, whereby In metal species are formed even at 573 K in hydrogen (Figure 3 F).107 Together with the extended metal–oxide interface prevalent for these thin film systems, this leads to the effective loss of reactive oxygen, In metal species, and InPd formation even in the only slightly reducing conditions of a high vacuum in the absence of hydrogen.94, 107

3.1.2. Stabilization of unusual particle morphologies and crystallographic aspects
The discussion of both topics goes well beyond the simple formation of the intermetallic compound itself. Although reported for a number of systems, triggering special particle morphologies and directed exploitation of crystallographic relations in the formation of intermetallic formation through the reactive metal–support interaction usually requires special model systems. Special particle morphologies have been reported for CePt5 (starting from a 4 wt % Pt/CeO2 powder catalyst),44, 89 Pt3V,94 Pd3V,94 Pt3Si,15 Pt3Al,13, 14 and CePt313, 14 (starting from Pt/V2O3, Pd/V2O3, Pt/SiO2, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt/CeO2 thin film catalysts). As a representative example, Figure 4 shows two well-facetted CePt5 particles in the [0 1 0] zone axis obtained by Bernal et al. starting from a 4 % Pt/CeO2 catalyst, subsequently reduced in hydrogen at 1173 K. The intermetallic particles both show (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) lattice fringes and are attached to two larger CeO2 grains. The presence of CePt5 has also been confirmed by image simulation. The importance of the metal–oxide interface is further highlighted by the HRTEM image shown in Figure 5. Epitaxy of (1 0 0) CePt5//(0 0 2) CeO2 and (0 0 1) CePt5//(0 0 2)CeO2 has been observed in the image and, thus, in the corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern. This is due to the high degree of structural match of the cubic CeO2 and hexagonal CePt5 structures.44

Special growth orientations have also been reported to account for the formation of well-oriented CePt3 particles starting from Pt/CeO2 thin film catalysts (Figure 6). Due to the epitaxial growth of Pt on NaCl(0 0 1) and the subsequent embedding in the CeO2 matrix (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in parts A and C, respectively), a large metal–oxide interface is created. In consequence, well-facetted and reconstructed CePt3 particles are formed at comparatively low temperatures of 773 K (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in parts B and D, respectively). CeO2 itself appears in the SAED pattern as a set of ring reflections; Pt exhibits discrete spots due to its crystallite size and epitaxial growth on NaCl(0 0 1). Notably, Pt and CePt3 are well-oriented with respect to each other, a consequence of the close match of the face-centered cubic Pt and simple cubic CePt3 structures (lattice parameter mismatch ≈8 %13, 14). Hence, the Pt(2 0 0) and CePt3(1 0 0) spots are found in the same azimuthal orientation in the SAED patterns.

Special crystallographic relations between metal, oxide support, and intermetallic compound may give rise to a much larger number of well-oriented intermetallic compounds. These have been obtained in all of the above including ZnPd,3–6, 12, 52, 56, 60–63, 86, 87, 98, 99 Ga5Pd2,58, 59 Ni3Si,23 Pd2Si,101 ZnPt,18 and Pt3Si.47 The explanation for both phenomena must include the complex interaction of the reducing agent (hydrogen) with the metal surface at higher temperatures, as well as topotactic growth or melting and recrystallization. Regarding the former, and most obvious also for the particles shown in Figure 6 and MPt3 (M=Ce, Al, Si) intermetallic compound particles in general, it is clear that the first step of intermetallic compound formation must involve the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the Pt surface. In due course, as has been known for a long time, particle shapes may be altered by exposure to a specific gas atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In that respect, a transformation of drop-like Pt particles into particles with cubic morphology has been reported both by Wang et al.164 and by Shi and Masel et al.166, 167 upon exposure to hydrogen at 900 K. However, regardless of the high importance of the subsequent intermetallic compound formation and the stabilization of unusual particle morphologies, the authors give different explanations. Wang et al. ascribe the behavior to the initial presence of impurities (e.g., carbon or oxygen), which are subsequently removed upon treatment in hydrogen but stay intact if other gases are used (e.g., nitrogen).164 This implies that the cubic outlines represent the equilibrium crystal shape of the clean Pt particles, whereas the rounded ones are associated with those of the adsorbate-covered Pt particles. In contrast, Shi and Masel et al. argue that the adsorption of hydrogen on different crystal facets might specifically lower the surface free energy of certain facets. As a result, those facets might grow in the presence of an adgas.166, 167 This has also been focused on by McCabe and Schmidt, who conclude that the activation energy of hydrogen adsorption varies significantly with the crystal facet.168 In that respect, Pt(1 1 0) facets bind hydrogen more strongly, followed by Pt(2 1 0) and Pt(2 1 1). In contrast, Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(1 1 1) bind hydrogen most weakly. Accordingly, the Pt(1 1 0) surface should fill up with hydrogen first and is stabilized and grows in the presence of hydrogen, whereas the Pt(1 1 1) facets are expected to shrink. Similar shape transformations for Pt particles have also been observed in hydrogen sulfide-containing mixtures.169, 170 Notably, however, some authors did not observe these shape transformations upon treatment in hydrogen or hydrogen-containing mixtures.171–178 At least it can be expected that some crystallographic relation between Pt and the substrate may be responsible for the peculiar cubic morphology of the intermetallic compounds observed, because the transformation into cubes has almost always been observed on planar thin-film model catalysts. Similar arguments also hold for the corresponding AlPt3 and CePt3 systems.13, 14 As discussed in the preceding section on the reaction mechanism, the next steps in the intermetallic compound formation process are the penetration of the metal surface by atomic hydrogen and the reduction of SiO2 (or any other oxide) followed by the migration of the Si atoms into the Pt particles and a topotactic growth of Pt3Si at the interface of the Pt particles. This crystallographic match can be derived from HRTEM images and electron diffraction patterns, showing cubic Pt3Si with the Cu3Au-type crystal structure (Figure 7 A) and slightly distorted monoclinic Pt3Si (Figure 7 B) on their simplest zone axes, that is, the [1 0 0] zone axis for Pt and cubic Pt3Si and the [1 0 0], [0 1 0], or [0 0 1] zone axes for monoclinic Pt3Si. The corresponding electron diffraction patterns show spots of cubic Pt3Si in the same azimuthal orientation as those of Pt.15 A HRTEM image of an irregular Pt12Si5 particle without pronounced crystallographic relation to the former Pt lattice is shown in Figure 7 C. Notably, intermetallic compound formation in the Pt-SiO2 system has been revealed by dark-field imaging to include a flattening of particles owing to an increased degree of metal–support interaction.15 Similar observation have also been made by Lamber et al. during the formation of the intermetallic compounds Pt3Si and Pt2Si.39

A corresponding well-facetted ZnPt particle, obtained by reduction of Pt particles on a ZnAl2O4 spinel matrix at 773 K is shown in Figure 8.

An instructive example encompassing both particle morphologies and crystallographic aspects are Pt3V and Pd3V intermetallic compounds, which are both formed after treatment in hydrogen at 673–773 K, starting from the corresponding Pt/V2O3 and Pd/V2O3 systems. Due to the epitaxial ordering between the Pt/Pd structures and the V2O3 support, well-ordered and cube-like particles of tetragonal Pt3V and Pd3V are obtained (Figure 9 A and B, respectively). In contrast, if the epitaxy between Pt/Pd and V2O3 is lifted by a simple oxidation procedure (at 673 K, transforming the catalysts into Pt/V2O5 and Pd/V2O5) before the actual reduction steps, the same Pt3V and Pd3V intermetallic compounds are obtained but without ordering or distinct cube morphology (Figure 9 C).94 This is a clear indication that the crystallographic match between the metal particles and the forming intermetallic compound steers the morphology that is subsequently formed and stabilized.

Notably, the morphology and crystallographic match can explain the formation of a number of especially well-ordered intermetallic compounds, but not those of typically higher non-noble metal content. This has been discussed in detail for the formation of Pt12Si5 (starting from Pt/SiO2),15, 40 Pd3Si (starting from Pd/SiO2),24 V3Rh and VRh (both starting from Rh/V2O3),54, 55 GaPd (starting from Pd/Ga2O3),58 GePd (starting from Pd/GeO2),12 Pd3Sn2 (starting from Pd/SnO2),12 and In3Pd2/In3Pd (starting from Pd/In2O3).12 The formation of all these noble-metal-poorer intermetallic compounds is sometimes believed to proceed via the correspondingly noble-metal-richer intermetallic compounds by diffusion and stepwise incorporation of the other non-noble metal atom into the noble metal phase. This has been discussed explicitly for Pt12Si5 (proceeding via the initial cubic Pt3Si phase).15 A similar mechanism has been suggested by Juszczyk and Karpinski to explain the presence of Pd-depleted phases in the Pd/SiO2 system.24 In particular, the stepwise formation of the Pd-depleted Pd3Si compound should proceed via the Pd-richer Pd4Si compound and was stated to involve the incorporation of Si into the intermetallic compound.24 However, as for example the Pt-depleted phases do not show any crystallographic relationship with Pt or the Pt3Si compound, the exact mechanism remains unclear. For the corresponding V-richer intermetallic compounds, the penetration of metallic V from the Rh–VOx interface into the Rh bulk was found to depend on both the concentration gradient and the reduction temperature. One therefore might anticipate a V-richer shell around the particle perimeter at lower reduction temperature, whereas at higher temperatures the V concentration gradient to the particle core is levelled gradually and V-richer intermetallic compounds are formed but not primarily influenced by crystallographic orientations.54, 55
However, even coalescence of neighboring particles, overlapping of different phases, and melting and recrystallization phenomena must be taken into account to fully appreciate the pathway of intermetallic compound formation and the resulting morphology. This scenario is clearly visible in the high-temperature reduction of Pt/SiO2. Curved edges, grain boundaries, truncated corners and other features of high atom diffusivity are all present on and in the particles and accordingly visible in the corresponding HRTEM images. This also includes flattening of the particles upon silicide formation.15
3.1.3. Reversibility of intermetallic compound formation
The potential decomposition and (full) structural reversal of intermetallic compound formation represents one of the core topics in not only the full understanding of the structural and catalytic action of intermetallic compounds but also in the judgment of the metal–support interaction itself.89, 159 As already outlined in the Introduction, full structural reversal to the state prior to entering the intermetallic state is a prerequisite for an interaction to be classified as “strong” metal–support interaction.159 Nevertheless, the general inability of an intermetallic system, formed after reduction in hydrogen, to return to this initial state, has ultimately led to the introduction of the new term “reactive” metal–support interaction.1 Usually, the decomposition of the intermetallic compound is achieved through high-temperature oxidation in either oxygen or air. This oxidation treatment, however, does not typically reverse morphological and structural changes, and metal particle redispersion after sintering is only partially restored.
There are only a few cases in literature in which these issues are discussed in detail, directly via monitoring by structure-determining methods or indirectly via changes in the catalytic profiles. Juszczyk et al. investigated the transformation from Pd2Si to Pd metal and SiO2 after a high-temperature oxidation treatment and revealed a final state of partial coverage of the metal by SiO2 species.24 This was proven on the basis of catalytic measurements in n-pentane isomerization,24 depicted schematically in Figure 10. This shows the complex interplay of metal, intermetallic compound, and support under different reduction and oxidation treatments and gives hints towards a partial coverage of the metal particles by reoxidized SiO2.24 However, no direct structural proof has been provided. Similar observations have been made by Hippe et al. for the oxidative decomposition of Pt3Si/Pt12Si5 mixtures,40 who concluded the partial decoration of the metal particles by SiO2 to account for the insufficient CO chemisorption capability upon reoxidation (Figure 11, spectrum E). Pakhomov et al. reported the transformation of δ-ZnPt to ZnPt3, the initial supporting spinel and ZnO after a treatment in air at 823 K for 30 min.92 Zawadzki et al. reported decomposition of the ZnPt compound upon treatment in air at 1073 K,18 as did Ren-Yuan et al. for Al-Pt alloys.17 Sadi et al. reported that very high temperatures are necessary to invert Rh2Si intermetallic compound formation by titration with water.26 Similar arguments were also stressed by Bernal et al. for the stability of CePt5 compound particles. Even after reoxidation at 773 K, no decomposition was observed.45 A Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst showed the same behavior, although in this special case, the formation of the covering oxide layer after reoxidation seemed to be dependent on the initial degree of intermetallic compound formation. Thus, a catalyst prereduced at 523 K (with the presence of Ga2Pd5) was fully transformed to a Pd/PdO mixture after reoxidation in oxygen at 673 K, whereas deeper reduction at 673 K caused the formation of a core–shell particle with a metallic Pd core and an amorphous Ga2O3 shell after reoxidation at 673 K.58 A similar shell of In2O3 around a Pd metal particle has been observed upon oxidative decomposition of InPd.12 In contrast, there are also some reports that the decomposition of the intermetallic compound does not lead to encapsulated metal particles, but rather to a mixture of metal particles and oxide. This has been proven directly by electron microscopy for the decomposition of Pt3V, Pd3V, and Rh-V intermetallic compounds,54, 94 and for the latter additionally by changes in the selectivity patterns in CO hydrogenation.55

3.1.4. Single- and multiphase intermetallic compound formation
The discussion in this section is very much connected to the preceding section about the reaction mechanism and the stabilization of unusual particle morphologies or the influence of crystallographic aspects. It is nevertheless of high importance, especially regarding the potential technological or catalytic applications. Regarding the latter, for both fundamental scientific and more application-oriented uses, preparation and/or formation of single-phase intermetallic compounds would be highly desirable. Generally, the preparation pathway to intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction is not a very directed one and very often mixtures of several intermetallic compounds occur; this is due to a delicate interplay between thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic compound and the diffusion kinetics, which strongly depend upon the particle size. This is especially true if the compound is formed during the catalytic reaction. Some degree of steering can be achieved through crystallographic relationships, as discussed earlier, but this usually applies only to a minor number of intermetallic compounds. As the occurrence of such compounds is a frequent phenomenon in catalytic science, getting some ideas on how to judge whether single- or multiphase intermetallic compounds can be expected would be desirable. The corresponding phase diagrams are a valuable starting point, with a subsequent search for phases with high melting points, indicating highly stable intermetallic compounds. An archetypical example is the Pd-Zn phase diagram (but other valid examples are the phase diagrams of Pd-Si and Ge-Pd, strongly dominated by Pd2Si and GePd2, respectively179), which exhibits one very pronounced intermetallic compound, namely ZnPd with tetragonal structure.99 By additionally exploiting the crystallographic match between the face-centered cubic Pd and the tetragonal ZnPd structure, which is better than 92 %, it is not only possible to prepare single-phase ZnPd particles but also to structurally stabilize the particles over a wide temperature region of up to 873 K.56 This, however, is a rare example. It is more common by far that, due to the diffusion kinetics, mixtures of different intermetallic compounds are present. In addition, the kinds of phases present and the ratios between them are not only strongly time dependent (diffusion kinetics) but also depend on the applied temperature (thermodynamic stability). At best, distinct temperature regions exist, in which a single intermetallic compound prevails before it is transformed further. Focusing in detail on the individual intermetallic compounds that are reported in the literature to be formed upon the reactive metal–support interaction, experimental procedures exist for the majority of systems, which indeed allow stabilization of the compound within a well-defined temperature region. This is true for Rh3Si,21 Rh2Si,26 Pd2Si,101 Pt3Al,13, 14 CePt3,13, 14 Ni3Si23 (in this special case, for smaller particles only Ni3Si is observed, but mixtures of Ni metal and Ni3Si for larger ones), ZnPt,3–6, 48, 49, 83, 92 CePt5,89 monoclinic Pt3Si,47 Pt12Si5,15 ZnPt3,49, 92 ZnPd,3–6, 12, 52, 56, 60–63, 86, 87, 98, 99 InPd,12 In0.52Pd0.48,3–6 GaPd,58, 59 Ga2Pd5,58, 59 In2Pt,3–6 GePd2,12 In3Pd2,12 Pd2Sn,12 Pd3Sn2,12 and PdSn.12 In contrast, potential mixtures are reported for Rh3Ti/RhTi,30 Ni2Ti/Ni3Ti,154 Pt3Si (cubic and monoclinic)/Pt12Si5,15 Pt3Si/Pt12Si5,40 Pd3Si/Pd5Si,24, 27 and Ga5Pd/Ga2Pd5.3–6
Summarizing the literature, the conclusion can be drawn that the higher the amount of the corresponding main group metal in the intermetallic compound, the higher the necessary reduction temperature.
3.1.5. Influence of preparation artefacts on the formation of intermetallic compounds
A particularly important topic, which is also connected to the general assignment of intermetallic compound formation to a true reactive metal–support interaction, is related to sometimes misleading preparation artefacts of supported metal catalysts. These artefacts are usually connected with an at least partial dissolution of the oxide support in the aqueous precursor solution upon catalyst impregnation.180 Thus, an extended metal–oxide interface is created artificially, which may give rise to peculiar behavior upon heating in hydrogen at elevated temperatures. This effect is best highlighted in two examples, which present respectively the pre-intermetallic compound state and the different extent of intermetallic compound formation, if separate oxide modifications with varying solubility in water are used. Bernal et al. report on the peculiar behavior of La2O3-supported Rh particles, which show encapsulation effects (i.e., reduced La2−xO3−y species decorating the Rh particles) at surprisingly low reduction temperatures (473–573 K), given the hard reducibility of La2O3. As an explanation, which is supported by HRTEM imaging, partial dissolution of La2O3 in the aqueous Rh(NO3)3 solution is offered. In due course, the Rh particles are covered by oxidic La species, which, upon reduction, are converted to LaRhO3 perovskite and La2O2(CO3) species (Figure 12).89 Due to the intimate contact, this facilitates subsequent formation of La-Rh intermetallic compounds.

Copyright Elsevier 2003.
Although not always directly correlated with intermetallic compound formation, these preparation artefacts have been directly linked to peculiar intermetallic compound formation of Pd/GeO2 catalysts. For the latter, Pd particles have been impregnated on the tetragonal and hexagonal modifications of GeO2. The former is insoluble in water, but the latter slightly soluble. This different chemical behavior causes formation of GePd2 on Pd/GeO2 (tetragonal) at 673 K and GePd at 723 K (Figure 13 A). In contrast, GePd2 formation already starts at 473 K and GePd at 573 K, if Pd particles are supported on hexagonal GeO2 (Figure 13 B).12 The shift in onset temperature to lower temperatures in the latter case reflects precisely the more intimate contact between Pd and GeO2, which is established by partial dissolution of hexagonal GeO2 during catalyst preparation. In summary, these two examples highlight the importance of the extent of metal–oxide contact area for efficient intermetallic compound formation, also in view of the reaction mechanism discussed in the preceding section.

3.1.6. Particle size effects during the preparation of intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction
The kinetically motivated discussion about possible particle size effects during the preparation of oxide-supported intermetallic compounds is very much connected to the general importance and influence of the (inter)metallic–oxide interface on catalytic behavior and the formation of the intermetallic compounds in general. However, detailed studies on the particle size effects are very limited and only available for a few selected systems. Lamber and Romanowski linked the dispersion of Pt particles on SiO2 upon oxidation and reduction directly to an enhanced strong metal–support interaction.39 Lamber et al. found that the extent of Ni-Si intermetallic compound formation can be correlated directly to the Ni particle size in accordance with the increase in time needed for compound formation due to the longer diffusion paths. In due course, smaller Ni crystallites (<5 nm) were exclusively found to be fully converted to Ni3Si, but larger ones (>10 nm) only partially, that is, they contained both Ni metal and Ni3Si.23 Similar observations have been also made by Karim et al. in the Zn-Pd system.52 In this case, the particle size was also directly correlated to the CO2 selectivity in methanol steam reforming. High-temperature treatment led to complete transformation of Pd into ZnPd but the CO2 selectivity did not increase monotonically with the extent of intermetallic compound formation. Both fully transformed particles and mixed particles showed the same CO2 selectivity. However, smaller particles generally showed a lower CO2 selectivity. It was hence concluded that an increase in ZnPd particle size had no detrimental impact on the catalyst reactivity.52, 118, 147 A very similar particle size effect for ZnPd particles has been observed in the reverse water–gas shift reaction: the results indicated that the turnover frequency increased as the ZnPd crystallite size decreased.134 Also in the Pd-Ga2O3 system, a particle size effect was observed. Thus, higher reduction temperatures caused the formation of larger Ga2Pd5 particles and a generally deeper reduction of former Pd particles. However, the extent of intermetallic compound formation was not linked directly to CO2 selectivity in methanol steam reforming.58
3.2. Catalytic aspects
3.2.1. Overview of catalytic aspects
An overview of the intermetallic compounds that are encountered upon reactive metal–support interaction and the respective catalytic reactions is given in Table 2. The vast majority of intermetallic compounds are thus observed upon reductive pretreatments and only a few during the catalytic reaction itself.7–11 Regarding the former, the view on the use of intermetallic compounds for specific catalytic reactions has changed over the last few years in favor of the directed preparation of specific intermetallic compounds.1 A well-known example in this respect is the group of Pd-based intermetallic compounds, which have been found to selectively catalyze the methanol steam reforming reaction towards CO23–6 or the hydrogenation of acetylene.181 This directed approach has been fuelled by better understanding of their structural, bonding, and electronic properties in the last decade.1

With respect to that presented in Table 2, the formation of intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction is reported to have both a beneficial or detrimental effect, whereas upon deliberate preparation by prereduction, the vast majority of samples show beneficial effects. This has been reported especially for the selective dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate over ZnPd (Figure 14 A),4 the increase of the isomerization selectivity (n-pentane24 and n-heptane17, 102) over Pd3Si and AlPt catalysts, and the increase in methanation activity upon formation of ZnPt.83 Exemplarily, the n-heptane isomerization selectivity is drastically increased on AlPt from approximately 0 % before entering the intermetallic state to almost 20 % after reduction at 873 K, as shown in Figure 15. ZnPt has also been shown in detail to be a promising catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol.48, 49, 182 Rh-V intermetallic compounds (especially V3Rh5) have been shown to increase methane selectivity in CO hydrogenation.54, 55 Nevertheless, most of the data nowadays is available for a series of Pd-based intermetallic compounds, the presence of which has been shown to steer the selectivity of methanol steam reforming towards CO2 (Figure 14). † Notably, a series of comprehensive review articles especially for the archetypical ZnPd exist that highlight almost every structural and catalytic aspect in detail.2, 86, 98, 99, 103

Detrimental effects upon intermetallic compound formation have only been reported for benzene dehydrogenation over thus far compositionally unspecified PdSi phases (decrease in specific activity)35 and n-heptane conversion over ZnPt3 and ZnPt supported on Al-Zn spinels (catalyst deactivation).18
However, although the experimental catalytic results are very clear in most cases, explanations for the behavior are not usually given or based on speculation. This owes generally to the high structural and morphological complexity of the obtained systems, which very often hamper a clear addressing of the catalytic active site. This is even true for the most scrutinized Pd-based intermetallic systems in methanol steam reforming. Although the general presence of the intermetallic compounds for selective steam reforming of methanol are a widely accepted fact, the structural details of the catalytically active site are by far less clear and most probably involve interaction of the intermetallic compound with its (reduced) oxidic support.108, 109
3.2.2. Influence of the supporting oxide and the intermetallic compound–oxide interface
For a full understanding of the catalytic properties, the material has to be considered holistically. Although clear from a materials point of view, the fact that the resulting intermetallic compound is supported on a more-or-less reduced oxidic phase has been less present in the focus of discussion for most of the catalytic materials containing intermetallic compounds. Revisiting Pd-based systems, Coq et al. discussed the presence of a not-fully reduced Pd promoter in active mixed site ensembles of various catalytic reactions. This species is referred to as Pd-Mδ+ and may lead to synergistic effects, for example, in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by activation of the CO bond.183 Even in this case, it has to be emphasized that the thus created mixed sites are closely related to those typically encountered upon the reactive metal–support interaction and the associated presence of adlineation, that is, metal–oxide phase boundary, effects. Without revisiting the structural prerequisites and effects of the metal–support interaction, it is clear that the picture of the active mixed-site ensemble infers that the potentially active mixed site, for example, in the case of Pd/SiO2, is composed of structural ensembles of Pd-(SiOx)δ+-type compounds, if just the formation of migrated reduced oxide species is considered. Likewise, the presence of intermetallic compounds in contact with a reduced oxide species gives rise to mixed sites, best characterized as Pd2Si-(SiOx)δ+ or, with increasing complexity, Pd/Pd2Si-(SiOx)δ+. As a consequence, not only the metal–metal or metal–support interface but also the intermetallic compound–oxide support interface is extremely variable and the intermetallic compound–oxide interaction can no longer be neglected and, hence, must be considered for a full catalytic understanding of the catalytic ensemble. Taking this idea even further, this implies necessarily that not only the intermetallic but also the oxide itself may be structurally, morphologically, or catalytically altered. Typical manifestations include creation of surface and/or bulk defects and partial surface reduction including chemical or compositional changes. Summarizing, the actual catalytically active and selective state of such entities appears to be a composition of different potentially active sites, which goes far beyond the simple picture of an isolated intermetallic compound. Such a state would include necessarily intermetallic compounds, the intermetallic compound–oxide interface, and a more-or-less reduced state of the oxide itself.
Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of the systems, for which structural and catalytic functions of intermetallic compounds formed through the reactive metal–support interaction are discussed cooperatively, the role of the oxide is largely neglected and the catalytic properties are discussed almost solely on the basis of the pure intermetallic compound. This is surprising given that the metal–support interface has long been suspected to be important for catalytic activity. Notably, the mutual discrimination between a facilitated exchange of reactants at the interface and newly created interfacial sites is not important to highlight the general importance of the intermetallic compound–oxide interface. For the Pd/SiO2 system, Juszczyk et al. indicate the potential importance of this interface in n-pentane isomerization24 but again it is the Pd-based intermetallic compound system for which this influence of the interface is best appreciated and the transformation of the historical understanding of this class of catalyst systems from a simple to a very complex one, including the establishment of an intermetallic compound–oxide bifunctional synergism, can best be seen. In this respect, Iwasa et al., in the course of discovering the peculiar properties of the PdZn, GaPd, InPd, PtZn, GaPt, and InPt intermetallic compounds in methanol steam reforming, argued specifically in favor of the intermetallic surface-adsorbed formyl species that subsequently selectively decomposes to CO2.3 This led to the electronic picture resembling the electronic structure of copper (in the industrially used Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst) by the strongly altered electronic structure of ZnPd compared to the constituent metals.184 This match of electronic structure has in due course been verified by a number of experimental methods, including in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.185, 186 However, whereas the presence of the corresponding intermetallic compound is a prerequisite for CO2-selective steam reforming, a number of studies showed that water activation, which is of crucial importance for high CO2 selectivity, cannot proceed efficiently on the intermetallic surface and thus must involve the oxide support in some way.109, 110, 185, 187 Especially for the Pd/ZnO and Pd/Ga2O3 systems, this has been verified by structural, spectroscopic, and catalytic methods.108–110, 188 For the outstanding Pd/ZnO system, evidence has been collected by aberration-corrected electron microscopy that the simple ZnPd intermetallic compound supported on ZnO is not CO2-selective, rather the reaction-induced state of an extended ZnPd-ZnO interface, formed by ZnO surface segregation from the ZnPd particles and subsequent oxidation (Figure 16).108 Similar observations have also been made on a number of unsupported ZnPd samples.110, 185

4. Summary and Outlook
Reviewing the published studies involving the formation of intermetallic compounds through reactive metal–support interactions and the impact on the catalytic properties leads to the following conclusions. First of all, the reactive metal–support interaction occurs in a large number of catalytically interesting and relevant systems. The reactive metal–support interaction is very specific for each system, that is, the temperature upon which intermetallic compounds or alloys are formed during reduction depends not only on the combination of noble metal and supporting oxide but also upon the size of the supported noble metals, the oxide modification, and the pretreatment of the supporting oxide. In addition, the delicate interplay between thermodynamic stability of the compounds and diffusion kinetics of the second component further complicates the resulting phase composition after reduction. Taking the large amount of available data into account, the phenomenological effects of the reactive metal–support interaction are well defined. This applies to both structural and catalytic effects. Regarding the latter, the unintended reactive metal–support interaction usually has a largely detrimental effect on the catalytic activity and the selectivity towards thermodynamically less stable products increases. For potential beneficial effects, a systematic approach of exploring noble metal and oxide combinations with focus on the aforementioned parameters is needed. This, however, has not yet been attempted. The outcome of such studies would be the possibility for optimized (i.e., single-phase and with as small intermetallic particles as possible) syntheses to explore the full beneficial potential of intermetallic compounds in catalysis.
To finally revisit the definition of a “strong” metal–support interaction, it is likely that all reports of intermetallic compound formation starting from oxide-supported metal particles by partial reduction of the support cover no “strong” metal–support interaction in the strict definition of the term. This is always due to violation of the prerequisite for full reversibility of the phenomenon by reoxidation followed by mild reduction.

1. Introduction
Bi- or multimetallic systems, and among them intermetallic compounds, represent an interesting class of materials in catalysis due to their structural and electronic properties, rendering them promising catalysts for a range of reduction or oxidation reactions.1, 2 A multimetallic system might be either a structurally well-defined intermetallic compound (defined as a chemical compound of two or more metals with a crystal structure different from the constituting metals; characteristic is the presence of covalent and/or ionic bonds) or a substitutional alloy (defined by a material composed of at least two elements as a single- or multiphase solid solution), depending on the corresponding phase diagram.1 Whereas recent experimental and quantum mechanical studies focus on the knowledge-based matching of intermetallic compounds and catalytic reactions,1 a thorough literature review reveals that intermetallic compounds are much more frequently encountered than previously assumed (for a comprehensive overview of the use of intermetallic compounds in catalysis, we refer to Refs. 1, 2). This comprises instances of intermetallic compounds deliberately prepared to exploit distinct structural or electronic properties (e.g., with the well-known preparation of the supported intermetallic compound ZnPd for CO2-selective steam reforming3–6) and materials in which unintended intermetallic compound formation occurs as a result of their preparation or application under catalytic reaction conditions.7–12 Notably, the latter case represents the overwhelming majority of intermetallic compounds discussed in the catalytic community. Supported intermetallic compounds are prepared deliberately either through 1) promotion or modification of an oxide-supported metal (particle) with a second metal1 by reaction with a highly reactive reagent or 2) the oxide support itself taking part in the formation during the preparation of the intermetallic compound.1 It is the latter example, which often creates the structurally and electronically most complex scenarios, on which this Review is focused. Adding the metal atoms of the (usually oxidic) support as a reactant in the preparation of intermetallic compounds requires in most cases the reduction of the oxide at elevated temperatures by hydrogen (explicitly discussed for example, in Refs. 13–15). There are many examples of this kind in the literature with seemingly endless combinations of noble metal and oxide support.1, 13–158 The chemical properties of the supporting oxide usually determine the requirements for intermetallic compound formation under given reduction conditions and are in most cases the source of complexity.1, 13–15, 159 This is mainly due to the general presence of metal–support interactions and especially “strong metal–support interactions” (SMSI).160–164 The latter term, coined by Tauster et al., is reserved for structural rearrangements and electronic changes occurring exclusively upon reduction in hydrogen at elevated temperatures in the presence of easily reduced oxides such as TiO2 or CeO2.159 Hard-to-reduce oxides such as SiO2 or Al2O3 were excluded. Although this appears to be a convenient term to also describe the formation of intermetallic compounds from supported metal nanoparticles, its use does not come without strings attached and finally led to the introduction of the new term “reactive metal–support interaction”.1 Reactive metal–support interaction refers to a chemical reaction process occurring on the metal–oxide interface but under extremely harsh conditions (i.e., at very high temperatures upon reduction in hydrogen), in many cases leading to the formation of intermetallic compounds or alloys. To classify a metal–support interaction as “strong”, three strict requirements must be met: 1) the catalyst shows conventional chemical behavior at low reduction temperatures, 2) upon increasing the reduction temperature, the chemisorption capability of the dispersed metal phase towards “classic” probe molecules such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide is disturbed along with substantial changes in its catalytic behavior, and, most importantly, 3) the phenomenon must be fully reversible, that is, reoxidation at an appropriate temperature followed by mild rereduction reestablishes the catalytic behavior prior to entering the SMSI state.159 The strong metal–support interaction is thought to originate from perturbations associated with electronic interactions (also localized) between the dispersed metal phase and reduced oxide support and loss of active metal area by encapsulation, decoration, and support migration (i.e., the active centers for chemisorption at the metal surface are blocked at high reduction temperatures by partial coverage by a thin layer of the reduced oxide support).162, 165 A tentative overview of the effects of the degree of metal–support interaction on chemisorption, catalytic patterns, and structure, including as an extreme case the formation of intermetallic compounds, is presented in Figure 1.

Focusing on the intermetallic compound and/or alloy formation as the most extreme case of “strong” metal–support interaction, requirement 3) is not usually fulfilled. Decomposition of intermetallic compounds is only possible by using harsh oxidation treatments, which do not restore the structural and electronic properties to those before entering the intermetallic state.1 Although the term “strong metal–support interaction” is therefore misleading and should be avoided, its structural and electronic manifestations offer a convenient pathway to discuss the inherent complexity of oxide-supported intermetallic compounds. This complexity might include both structural and catalytic aspects. For oxidation reactions, this is in most cases due to the presence of an intermetallic compound–oxide interface, which forms on entering the intermetallic state upon reduction. The reaction between the supported metal and the metal resulting from the reduction of the support leads to a set of questions, which are important for the properties of the materials: Which new phase(s) form? Which crystallographic and electronic structure results? Do the particles realize unusual particle morphologies? Do they grow topotactically? Is the intermetallic compound stable under reaction conditions? How does the reducibility of the support affect the intermetallic compound formation and does the preparation of the catalyst affect the extent of intermetallic compound formation?
The importance of addressing these questions becomes clear after considering the effects on the catalytic properties, such as changes in catalytic activity or selectivity upon entering the intermetallic compound state. Also, the influence of the newly created interface (i.e., are special sites at the interface created upon entering the intermetallic state?) on the catalytic properties might be important.
By comparative studies of supported and unsupported intermetallic compounds, the question of whether the intermetallic compounds are the catalytically active and selective phases or just a part of a larger synergistic catalytic entity can be investigated, answering also the question of whether the supporting oxide contributes to the catalytic properties. In the larger context, the question of which reactions would be influenced by intermetallic formation can be answered.
A very important issue, also concerning the judgement of whether a strong metal–support interaction in a strict definition of the term or a reactive metal–support interaction is present, is related to the general formation mechanism of the intermetallic compound. Considering that the initial pre-intermetallic state of the catalyst is oxide-supported metal particles, four possible mechanisms are discussed in literature:
Equation (1) A direct reaction between the noble metal and the oxide to the corresponding intermetallic compound and the associated noble metal oxide, for example:21
(1)
Equation (2) A surface-specific reaction at the oxide–metal contact via chemisorbed oxygen on the metal surface, for example:21
(2)
Equation (3) A reaction via hydroxylated surface species, for example:101
(3)
Equation (4) A direct reaction by reduction of the oxide in hydrogen, for example:26, 101
(4)
Notably, the first two mechanisms do not require hydrogen for formation of the intermetallic compound. Indeed, the most crucial component determining the pathway of intermetallic compound formation is the supporting oxide, and, more specifically, its thermodynamic stability and the resulting reducibility. The first two mechanisms have been solely discussed for the hydrogen-free formation of MSi intermetallic compounds by simple thermal annealing. Furthermore, due to the very high formation enthalpy of SiO2, the first mechanism has been discarded explicitly for Rh-SiO221 and Cu-SiO2 systems.25 In contrast, the prevalence of a mechanism that includes at least partial reduction of the support is nowadays favored and has been stated explicitly for Pt on SiO2,13–15, 29 Al2O3,13, 14 CeO2,13, 14 VOx,94 and TiO2,113 Pd on SiO2,56, 101 and Rh on SiO2,26 CeO2,53 ZnO,56 and V2O3.54, 55, 76 Surface-specific mechanisms have been held accountable for the formation of CuSi25 and RhSi.21 The formation of the intermetallic compounds most probably includes the following reaction steps: 1) reduction of the oxidic support in the vicinity of the supported particles by hydrogen activated on the latter, 2) diffusion of these metallic species into the noble metal lattice and 3) formation of the respective intermetallic compound(s). For efficient formation of intermetallic compounds, steady removal of the formed water is a prerequisite, as is effective hydrogen activation on the noble metal surface.13–15 Notably, evidence for this reaction mechanism has been collected for Pt particles on SiO2 (Figure 2).15 Parts A and B of Figure 2 show Pt particles on SiO2 in the as-grown state (part A) and after reduction at 873 K (part B), in which a and b denote reconstructed and irregular intermetallic Pt3Si and Pt12Si5 particles, respectively. In this special case, electron energy loss spectroscopy (part C) reveals not only clear indications of SiO2 reduction but also clear differences in the extent of reduction as a function of distance from the metal particles. Thus, SiO2 far away from the metal particles (and hence, far away from dissociatively activated hydrogen) only shows minor signs of reduction, whereas SiO2 close to the metal surface shows clear indications of distortion of the SiO2 building blocks by hydrogen reduction.15 The necessity for dissociatively activated hydrogen has also been stressed by Lamber explicitly for the formation of Pt2Si compounds.29 Notably, a possible reaction mechanism must also include kinetic diffusion limitations of the second metal phase to account for the formation of compound mixtures and particle size effects, as observed in a number of intermetallic compound systems (for details we refer to the following sections).

To highlight the possibility and feasibility of intermetallic compound formation, we will focus briefly on the thermodynamics of the Pt/SiO2 system discussed in Refs. 13, 14. For the reaction shown in Equation (5), the standard reaction enthalpy at 900 K is +393 kJ mol−1 (this can be calculated simply from the formation enthalpies of the reactants, including the one for Pt3Si, which can be calculated by using DFT to be −115.9 kJ mol−1).13, 14
(5)
The standard formation entropy of the intermetallic compound is not known, but it is possible to give a rough estimate from the standard formation entropy of the isostructural Cu3Au compound (+238.6 J mol−1). The free reaction enthalpy at 900 K is therefore +178 kJ mol−1, resulting in an equilibrium constant of 4.5×10−11, indicating a highly endergonic reaction. Under the given experimental conditions (reactor volume 16 mL),13, 14 a water pressure of approximately 10−3 bar is built up at a hydrogen pressure of 1 bar. However, as the reduction experiments are performed under flowing conditions, the water is permanently removed, thus, the water partial pressure is kept on a low level and the reaction forced towards the products. Water formation occurs predominantly at the Pt–SiO2 interface by reaction of diffusing atomic hydrogen with the SiO2 substrate. The high formation energy and high stability of the intermetallic compounds formed also applies to compounds of differing stoichiometry, for example, −127.8 kJ mol−1 for a PtSi phase. Similar arguments also hold for the corresponding Pt3Al (equilibrium constant 1.3×10−9)13, 14 and Pt3Ce (equilibrium constant 2.4×10−6)13, 14 compounds. In all these cases, classical thermodynamics does not limit intermetallic compound formation because the experimental setup allows for permanent removal of reactant water.
As for the thermodynamics of supporting oxide reduction, this is basically dominated by the standard formation enthalpies of the oxides under question: for the Al2O3 and CeO2 examples discussed above, these enthalpies are −1651 kJ mol−1 and −1085 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating that intermetallic compound formation requires higher temperatures on Al2O3, corroborating the experimental results. Supporting the noble metals on oxides with smaller formation enthalpies, for example, the use of ZnO, GeO2, or Fe2O3 results in much lower temperatures required for the formation of intermetallic compounds.
This Review tries to summarize the present dispersed and far from systematic knowledge on the preparation of supported intermetallic compounds via the reactive metal–support interaction. In addition, the complexity of such systems is highlighted, also addressing structural and catalytic aspects in selected examples. Cross-correlations to unsupported intermetallic compounds are attempted whenever applicable to highlight the differences and common features.
2. Formation of Intermetallic Compounds
To highlight the widespread presence of intermetallic compounds, Table 1 gives a compact overview of combinations known to date of transition metals and oxides, for which, after a high-temperature treatment in hydrogen, the formation of intermetallic compounds has been reported. By far the most data are found for the classical catalytically active noble metal particles Pt, Rh, and Pd, much less data for Ni, Cu, Ru, and Au. The examples include only supported nanoparticulate systems, either as classical impregnated catalysts or thin film model systems. Notably, regarding the stability of the intermetallic phases discussed below, the TEM work contains exclusively ex situ-obtained data. This poses the general stability question when the formed intermetallic compounds are exposed to air; changes their structure and cross-correlations to catalytic data are established. Although in situ or, better still, operando, characterizations are highly desirable, these data are not available to date. However, most of the intermetallic compounds need very harsh reoxidation temperatures for decomposition (T≥673 K; see section 3.1.3.). An obvious exception concerns intermetallic compounds with bi-functional synergism prevalent in the working state of the catalyst between the support and the intermetallic compound particles, but even in these cases, the working state is sometimes preserved upon transfer (e.g., ZnPd on ZnO108).

2.1. Platinum
For systems including Pt particles, formation of intermetallic compounds is a fairly common feature, both on easily reducible and hard-to-reduce oxides. On CeO2, only two distinct intermetallic compounds are observed, CePt313, 14 and CePt5.11, 20, 44, 45, 89 Whereas the former has only been observed in thin film systems after reduction in hydrogen at 873 K,13, 14 the latter has been reported more frequently.11, 20, 44, 45, 89 As a common feature, CePt5 is only observed at reduction temperatures of 1173 K and higher. CePt5 has also been reported for Tb-doped Pt/CeO2 systems.89 Ce-Pt compound formation has been reported at and above 750 K in thin film Pt samples90 and has been held responsible for catalyst deactivation upon reduction in hydrogen between 473 and 773 K.91 For Pt on Ga2O3, reduction at 773 K on an impregnated catalyst yields the intermetallic compounds Ga3Pt5 and Ga5.4Pt10.6.3, 6 The system Pt/ZnO is a very interesting one, as different intermetallic compounds are observed if different Zn-containing supports are used. On Pt/ZnO, only the intermetallic compound ZnPt is encountered, typically after high-temperature reduction between 473 and 773 K.3, 6, 48, 49, 76, 116, 117, 128, 133, 137, 146 For Pt particles supported on an Al-Zn spinel, both ZnPt and ZnPt3 have been observed,18, 92 depending on the reduction/annealing temperature. ZnPt is found after reduction at 830–850 K in hydrogen, whereas treatments at lower temperatures or oxidative regeneration lead to the formation of the Pt-rich ZnPt3 phase.18, 92 Use of SiO2 or Al2O3 as a support for metal particles demonstrated for the first time the strong metal–support interaction with hard-to-reduce oxides. Reduction at high temperatures (773–1173 K) led to the formation of the intermetallic compounds PtSi, Pt2Si, cubic and monoclinic Pt3Si, and Pt12Si5.13–15, 29, 39, 40, 47 Similar to SiO2, intermetallic compound or alloy formation with participation of Al2O3 needs very harsh reduction conditions at and above 773 K. Al-Pt alloys and the intermetallic compound AlPt3 were reported.13, 14, 25, 31, 33, 157 Reduction of Pt/SnO2 and Pt/In2O3 catalysts at 673 and 523 K caused the formation of the intermetallic compounds SnPt, Sn2Pt, Sn4Pt, and In2Pt, respectively.3, 6, 93, 140 On Pt/V2O3 catalysts, the ordering of the intermetallic compound Pt3V, prepared by reduction at 773 K, could be triggered by preoxidation treatments prior to reduction.94 In addition, by using TiO2 as the support, electron microscopy revealed the formation of TiPt intermetallic compounds after high-temperature reduction95 and a TiPt3 phase after reduction at 823 K.113 TiPt3 has also been observed by Beard et al. after reduction at 973 K.114 Direct Pt-Ti interactions were detected after reduction at 773 K by Belton et al.96
2.2. Rhodium
Compared to oxide-supported Pt and Pd particles, the formation of intermetallic compounds in Rh-containing systems has scarcely been investigated. Only for four oxides, that is, CeO2, SiO2, TiO2, and V2O3, has intermetallic formation after high-temperature reduction been reported. CeRh3 particles were obtained after reduction at 773 K on a Rh/CeO2 thin film catalyst,49 Rh2Si26 and Rh3Si particles21 on powder samples after reduction at 1223 and 850 K. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements were used to identify not only direct Rh-Ti interactions after reduction at 773 K,97 but also distinct TiRh3 and TiRh intermetallic compounds at 623 K.30 By using V2O3 as the support, Rh3V, RhV3, and Rh5V3 intermetallic compounds have been obtained at temperatures of 673 K and higher.54, 55, 76
2.3. Palladium
A closer look at the literature reveals that the most data are available by far for oxide-supported Pd particles. † This indicates both the number of different intermetallic compounds formed and that the system has been scrutinized particularly from structural, electronic, and catalytic points of view in the last decade. † Pd/ZnO is by far the most experimentally and theoretically studied system. Intermetallic compound formation has been observed with participation of easily reducible transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O3 or V2O594), refractory oxides (e.g., SiO2,24, 27, 36, 37 Al2O3,57 or GeO212), or with oxides giving rise to special catalytic applications (e.g., methanol steam reforming and selective hydrogenation of acetylene: Ga2O3,3–6, 50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 74, 75, 100, 136 ZnO, † In2O3,3–6, 107, 136 or SnO2;12 and the reverse water–gas shift reaction: ZnO134, 135). More or less well-ordered Pd3V is obtained after high-temperature reduction treatments in hydrogen at and above 773 K.94 Pd/SiO2 systems are particularly well studied with respect to the metal–support interaction at high temperatures. Moss et al. explained the decrease in specific activity for benzene hydrogenation for a Pd/SiO2 catalyst upon raising the reduction temperature to 873 K by the formation of an intermetallic compound.35 A metal–support interaction and Pd2Si intermetallic compound formation was also reported by Lamber et al.101 and Penner et al.56 after reduction at 873 K. In the former case, microdiffraction showed an oriented growth of the Pd2Si compound with respect to the Pd matrix. A variety of different Pd-silicides (notably, Pd3Si, Pd4Si, and Pd5Si) in strongly reduced Pd/SiO2 samples, showing different catalytic properties, were also detected by XRD and TEM analyses.24, 36, 37, 101 Equally, the interaction of Pd particles with reduced Al2O3 supports yielded the intermetallic compounds AlPd and Al3Pd4.41, 57, 102 Recent interest in preparing CO2-selective methanol steam reforming catalysts resulted in the formation of a number of Pd-based intermetallic compounds on “unusual” oxide supports, namely ZnO, Ga2O3, In2O3, SnO2, and GeO2. Whereas the intermetallic compound formation, at least at low reduction temperatures (i.e., 573 K) for ZnO and GeO2, is relatively simple and gives rise to ZnPd † and GePd2,12 the situation is more complex for the other oxides. Over Ga2O3, a large variety of different intermetallic compounds with compositions from GaPd2 and Ga2Pd5 to GaPd and Ga5Pd have all been reported on thin film and impregnated Pd/Ga2O3 systems3–6, 50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 85, 100 after reduction at and above 523 K. Particularly well-studied is the supported intermetallic compound GaPd2,50, 51, 58, 59, 64, 100 which can also be prepared by decomposition of hydrotalcite precursors.74, 75 In this regard, the formation of the intermetallic compound has also been studied with respect to structure and catalysis over different polymorphic forms of Ga2O3.64, 100 The intermetallic compound InPd was obtained after heating thin films and impregnated Pd/In2O3 samples at 523 K in hydrogen.3–6, 12 In3Pd2 was obtained only on the impregnated system after reduction at 773 K, followed by In3Pd.12 In general, intermetallic formation over Pd/In2O3 is influenced heavily by the reducibility of single-phase In2O3 to the metallic In state. For the thin film sample, InPd formation already occurs upon preparation before the reduction treatment.12 Reduction of Pd/SnO2 samples induces formation of an array of Pd-Sn intermetallic compounds, including Pd2Sn, PdSn, and Pd3Sn2.12, 41 As with Pd/Ga2O3, intermetallic compound formation in the impregnated Pd/GeO2 system offers the advantage of convenient study of the influence of the structure and chemical state of the oxide support. In fact, GePd2 formation by using Pd particles on tetragonal GeO2 yielded only GePd2, but those on hexagonal GeO2 a mixture of GePd2 and GePd. This was explained tentatively by reference to the higher solubility of hexagonal GeO2 in water giving rise to an enhanced metal–support contact area upon catalyst preparation and in turn, more efficient intermetallic compound formation.12 The properties of the prototypical intermetallic compound–oxide system that has evolved in the last decade, Pd/ZnO (and ZnPd/ZnO after reduction), should not be discussed in detail at this point, since comprehensive reviews for almost all aspects of its chemical and electronic structure and catalytic properties already exist.86, 98, 99, 103 However, mixtures of ZnPd, Zn3Pd2, and ZnPd2 have also been obtained by interaction between Pd and ZnO, depending on the synthesis conditions.1, 79 The Pd/CeO2 system has been scrutinized in detail under comparable reducing conditions, but no signs of a well-defined intermetallic compound have been observed up to 1180 K (over 20 h), neither by XRD, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), nor high-resolution (HR)TEM analyses. A solid solution of Ce in the Pd structure was proposed instead.59 Similarly, Kępiński et al. discuss a substitutional alloy Ce-Pd exhibiting a face-centered cubic structure with a slightly larger lattice constant that Pd metal, formed at 773 K and above. Interestingly, the authors infer the influence of a suppressed metal–support interface due to increased crystallite size of both Pd and CeO2 at higher reduction temperatures.111, 112 A Pd-Cr alloy phase has been observed after a methanol decomposition reaction by using XRD.126 0 1 2 3
2.4. Nickel
Information on the metal–support interaction and intermetallic compound formation in Ni-oxide systems is limited to date to the Ni-CeO2, Ni-TiO2, and Ni-SiO2 systems. CeNi and CeNi2 were observed after the hydrogenation of benzene at temperatures of approximately 500 K.8 In addition, Ni3Si was observed on a Ni/SiO2 catalyst after heating in hydrogen at 850 K.23 Martin et al. interpreted the decrease in hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activity at 1120 K as a result of the formation of Ni-silicide species.104 Praliaud and Martin inferred the presence of a Ni79Si11 compound from magnetic measurements at 1180 K.22 Ni/TiO2 reported by Chettibi et al. represented a complex system: whereas radiation-treated catalysts showed the presence of Ni2Ti and Ni3Ti phases, in the simple calcined and hydrogen-reduced sample, a Ni5TiO7 compound was found. This was attributed to the contribution of the persisting NiO phase during reduction. A higher cyclohexane selectivity in benzene hydrogenation for the radiation-treated catalyst resulted in turn.154
2.5. Copper
Formation of a Cu0.61Si0.39 intermetallic compound was observed after the decomposition of methanol over a Cu/ZnO catalyst.9 A copper silicide with unknown composition was postulated by Van den Oetelaar after a thermal treatment of a Cu/SiO2 catalyst under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 873 K.25
2.6. Gold
The single formation of an Au-Cu bimetallic phase has been observed for complex Au/CuO/TiO2 catalysts, which were formed by activation in air at 573 K and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at 573 K.16 A report by Liu et al. demonstrated for the first time the reactive metal–support interaction in nanorod Au/ZnO systems, that is, after reduction at 573 K in hydrogen; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements indicated the formation of an Au-Zn alloy phase.105
2.7. Ruthenium
Studies on the catalytic combustion of ethyl acetate over Ru/SnO2 catalysts revealed the formation of a Sn7Ru3 intermetallic compound after prereduction at 673 K (for 0.5 h) in hydrogen, as evidenced by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and HRTEM analyses. Interestingly, the large Sn7Ru3 particles were present in a characteristic core–shell structure, with a well-crystallized intermetallic compound core and an amorphous Sn-enriched shell. The core shell structure was proposed to arise from a phase separation of the catalyst after contact with air.138
3. Structural and Catalytic Aspects in Selected Examples
3.1. Structural aspects
3.1.1. Influence of the oxide’s reducibility on the formation of intermetallic compounds
The discussion on the influence of the oxide’s reducibility on the formation of intermetallic compounds represents one of the core topics in reactive and strong metal–support interactions. In the early days, the “strong” metal–support interaction was solely assigned to easily reducible transition metal oxides, such as TiO2 or CeO2, capable of forming sub-stoichiometric oxide species.159 Hard-to-reduce oxides, such as (as extreme cases) SiO2 or Al2O3, were excluded from entering a state of strong metal–support interaction. Recent studies, however, showed that this mutual discrimination is no longer valid. Even SiO2 or Al2O3, albeit at higher reduction temperatures, were found to enter the state of reactive metal–support interaction. Here, these comparably harsh reduction treatments did not lead to a collapse of the original structures of metal nor support. Furthermore, the metal species was sometimes needed for epitaxial growth of the intermetallic compound (for details, see section 3.1.2.). TEM analysis of thin film Pt/SiO2 and Pt/Al2O3 samples after entering the intermetallic compound state directly revealed the structural stability of especially the support.13, 14 Combinations for which this concept has been explicitly proven include Pt and Pd, on both SiO2 and Al2O3.13–15, 24, 27, 29, 35–37, 39, 40, 56, 158 Although this of course already implies that the reducibility of the corresponding oxides does have an influence on the formation of intermetallic compounds, a more catchy example includes Pd particles on In2O3 (Figure 3).12 Driven by the abilities of the intermetallic compound InPd to selectively catalyze the methanol steam reforming reaction towards CO2, the formation of InPd is heavily influenced on the one hand by the reduction behavior of In2O3 and on the other hand by the special preparation pathway. In due course, Pd particles conventionally prepared by incipient wetness impregnation on In2O3 (TEM image, Figure 3 A) enter a state of reactive metal–support interaction at approximately 573 K and InPd is thereby formed (TEM image, Figure 3 B; the corresponding XRD diffraction patterns are highlighted in part C). InPd is subsequently transformed into In3Pd2 at higher reduction temperatures. In contrast, if InPd is formed via a thin film model system, prepared by growing epitaxial Pd particles on NaCl(0 0 1) and subsequent embedding in a nm-thick film of In2O3 at 573 K (TEM image, Figure 3 D), compound formation already occurs during the preparation process (SAED pattern, Figure 3 E). The reason for this rather peculiar feature is the outspokenly well-pronounced reducibility of single-phase In2O3, whereby In metal species are formed even at 573 K in hydrogen (Figure 3 F).107 Together with the extended metal–oxide interface prevalent for these thin film systems, this leads to the effective loss of reactive oxygen, In metal species, and InPd formation even in the only slightly reducing conditions of a high vacuum in the absence of hydrogen.94, 107

3.1.2. Stabilization of unusual particle morphologies and crystallographic aspects
The discussion of both topics goes well beyond the simple formation of the intermetallic compound itself. Although reported for a number of systems, triggering special particle morphologies and directed exploitation of crystallographic relations in the formation of intermetallic formation through the reactive metal–support interaction usually requires special model systems. Special particle morphologies have been reported for CePt5 (starting from a 4 wt % Pt/CeO2 powder catalyst),44, 89 Pt3V,94 Pd3V,94 Pt3Si,15 Pt3Al,13, 14 and CePt313, 14 (starting from Pt/V2O3, Pd/V2O3, Pt/SiO2, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt/CeO2 thin film catalysts). As a representative example, Figure 4 shows two well-facetted CePt5 particles in the [0 1 0] zone axis obtained by Bernal et al. starting from a 4 % Pt/CeO2 catalyst, subsequently reduced in hydrogen at 1173 K. The intermetallic particles both show (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) lattice fringes and are attached to two larger CeO2 grains. The presence of CePt5 has also been confirmed by image simulation. The importance of the metal–oxide interface is further highlighted by the HRTEM image shown in Figure 5. Epitaxy of (1 0 0) CePt5//(0 0 2) CeO2 and (0 0 1) CePt5//(0 0 2)CeO2 has been observed in the image and, thus, in the corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern. This is due to the high degree of structural match of the cubic CeO2 and hexagonal CePt5 structures.44

Special growth orientations have also been reported to account for the formation of well-oriented CePt3 particles starting from Pt/CeO2 thin film catalysts (Figure 6). Due to the epitaxial growth of Pt on NaCl(0 0 1) and the subsequent embedding in the CeO2 matrix (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in parts A and C, respectively), a large metal–oxide interface is created. In consequence, well-facetted and reconstructed CePt3 particles are formed at comparatively low temperatures of 773 K (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in parts B and D, respectively). CeO2 itself appears in the SAED pattern as a set of ring reflections; Pt exhibits discrete spots due to its crystallite size and epitaxial growth on NaCl(0 0 1). Notably, Pt and CePt3 are well-oriented with respect to each other, a consequence of the close match of the face-centered cubic Pt and simple cubic CePt3 structures (lattice parameter mismatch ≈8 %13, 14). Hence, the Pt(2 0 0) and CePt3(1 0 0) spots are found in the same azimuthal orientation in the SAED patterns.

Special crystallographic relations between metal, oxide support, and intermetallic compound may give rise to a much larger number of well-oriented intermetallic compounds. These have been obtained in all of the above including ZnPd,3–6, 12, 52, 56, 60–63, 86, 87, 98, 99 Ga5Pd2,58, 59 Ni3Si,23 Pd2Si,101 ZnPt,18 and Pt3Si.47 The explanation for both phenomena must include the complex interaction of the reducing agent (hydrogen) with the metal surface at higher temperatures, as well as topotactic growth or melting and recrystallization. Regarding the former, and most obvious also for the particles shown in Figure 6 and MPt3 (M=Ce, Al, Si) intermetallic compound particles in general, it is clear that the first step of intermetallic compound formation must involve the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the Pt surface. In due course, as has been known for a long time, particle shapes may be altered by exposure to a specific gas atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In that respect, a transformation of drop-like Pt particles into particles with cubic morphology has been reported both by Wang et al.164 and by Shi and Masel et al.166, 167 upon exposure to hydrogen at 900 K. However, regardless of the high importance of the subsequent intermetallic compound formation and the stabilization of unusual particle morphologies, the authors give different explanations. Wang et al. ascribe the behavior to the initial presence of impurities (e.g., carbon or oxygen), which are subsequently removed upon treatment in hydrogen but stay intact if other gases are used (e.g., nitrogen).164 This implies that the cubic outlines represent the equilibrium crystal shape of the clean Pt particles, whereas the rounded ones are associated with those of the adsorbate-covered Pt particles. In contrast, Shi and Masel et al. argue that the adsorption of hydrogen on different crystal facets might specifically lower the surface free energy of certain facets. As a result, those facets might grow in the presence of an adgas.166, 167 This has also been focused on by McCabe and Schmidt, who conclude that the activation energy of hydrogen adsorption varies significantly with the crystal facet.168 In that respect, Pt(1 1 0) facets bind hydrogen more strongly, followed by Pt(2 1 0) and Pt(2 1 1). In contrast, Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(1 1 1) bind hydrogen most weakly. Accordingly, the Pt(1 1 0) surface should fill up with hydrogen first and is stabilized and grows in the presence of hydrogen, whereas the Pt(1 1 1) facets are expected to shrink. Similar shape transformations for Pt particles have also been observed in hydrogen sulfide-containing mixtures.169, 170 Notably, however, some authors did not observe these shape transformations upon treatment in hydrogen or hydrogen-containing mixtures.171–178 At least it can be expected that some crystallographic relation between Pt and the substrate may be responsible for the peculiar cubic morphology of the intermetallic compounds observed, because the transformation into cubes has almost always been observed on planar thin-film model catalysts. Similar arguments also hold for the corresponding AlPt3 and CePt3 systems.13, 14 As discussed in the preceding section on the reaction mechanism, the next steps in the intermetallic compound formation process are the penetration of the metal surface by atomic hydrogen and the reduction of SiO2 (or any other oxide) followed by the migration of the Si atoms into the Pt particles and a topotactic growth of Pt3Si at the interface of the Pt particles. This crystallographic match can be derived from HRTEM images and electron diffraction patterns, showing cubic Pt3Si with the Cu3Au-type crystal structure (Figure 7 A) and slightly distorted monoclinic Pt3Si (Figure 7 B) on their simplest zone axes, that is, the [1 0 0] zone axis for Pt and cubic Pt3Si and the [1 0 0], [0 1 0], or [0 0 1] zone axes for monoclinic Pt3Si. The corresponding electron diffraction patterns show spots of cubic Pt3Si in the same azimuthal orientation as those of Pt.15 A HRTEM image of an irregular Pt12Si5 particle without pronounced crystallographic relation to the former Pt lattice is shown in Figure 7 C. Notably, intermetallic compound formation in the Pt-SiO2 system has been revealed by dark-field imaging to include a flattening of particles owing to an increased degree of metal–support interaction.15 Similar observation have also been made by Lamber et al. during the formation of the intermetallic compounds Pt3Si and Pt2Si.39

A corresponding well-facetted ZnPt particle, obtained by reduction of Pt particles on a ZnAl2O4 spinel matrix at 773 K is shown in Figure 8. The 3-fold outline of the particle can be seen clearly.18 This is a clear indication that also on complex oxide systems metal–support interaction effects may stabilize well-outlined intermetallic particle morphologies.

An instructive example encompassing both particle morphologies and crystallographic aspects are Pt3V and Pd3V intermetallic compounds, which are both formed after treatment in hydrogen at 673–773 K, starting from the corresponding Pt/V2O3 and Pd/V2O3 systems. Due to the epitaxial ordering between the Pt/Pd structures and the V2O3 support, well-ordered and cube-like particles of tetragonal Pt3V and Pd3V are obtained (Figure 9 A and B, respectively). In contrast, if the epitaxy between Pt/Pd and V2O3 is lifted by a simple oxidation procedure (at 673 K, transforming the catalysts into Pt/V2O5 and Pd/V2O5) before the actual reduction steps, the same Pt3V and Pd3V intermetallic compounds are obtained but without ordering or distinct cube morphology (Figure 9 C).94 This is a clear indication that the crystallographic match between the metal particles and the forming intermetallic compound steers the morphology that is subsequently formed and stabilized.

Notably, the morphology and crystallographic match can explain the formation of a number of especially well-ordered intermetallic compounds, but not those of typically higher non-noble metal content. This has been discussed in detail for the formation of Pt12Si5 (starting from Pt/SiO2),15, 40 Pd3Si (starting from Pd/SiO2),24 V3Rh and VRh (both starting from Rh/V2O3),54, 55 GaPd (starting from Pd/Ga2O3),58 GePd (starting from Pd/GeO2),12 Pd3Sn2 (starting from Pd/SnO2),12 and In3Pd2/In3Pd (starting from Pd/In2O3).12 The formation of all these noble-metal-poorer intermetallic compounds is sometimes believed to proceed via the correspondingly noble-metal-richer intermetallic compounds by diffusion and stepwise incorporation of the other non-noble metal atom into the noble metal phase. This has been discussed explicitly for Pt12Si5 (proceeding via the initial cubic Pt3Si phase).15 A similar mechanism has been suggested by Juszczyk and Karpinski to explain the presence of Pd-depleted phases in the Pd/SiO2 system.24 In particular, the stepwise formation of the Pd-depleted Pd3Si compound should proceed via the Pd-richer Pd4Si compound and was stated to involve the incorporation of Si into the intermetallic compound.24 However, as for example the Pt-depleted phases do not show any crystallographic relationship with Pt or the Pt3Si compound, the exact mechanism remains unclear. For the corresponding V-richer intermetallic compounds, the penetration of metallic V from the Rh–VOx interface into the Rh bulk was found to depend on both the concentration gradient and the reduction temperature. One therefore might anticipate a V-richer shell around the particle perimeter at lower reduction temperature, whereas at higher temperatures the V concentration gradient to the particle core is levelled gradually and V-richer intermetallic compounds are formed but not primarily influenced by crystallographic orientations.54, 55
However, even coalescence of neighboring particles, overlapping of different phases, and melting and recrystallization phenomena must be taken into account to fully appreciate the pathway of intermetallic compound formation and the resulting morphology. This scenario is clearly visible in the high-temperature reduction of Pt/SiO2. Curved edges, grain boundaries, truncated corners and other features of high atom diffusivity are all present on and in the particles and accordingly visible in the corresponding HRTEM images. This also includes flattening of the particles upon silicide formation.15
3.1.3. Reversibility of intermetallic compound formation
The potential decomposition and (full) structural reversal of intermetallic compound formation represents one of the core topics in not only the full understanding of the structural and catalytic action of intermetallic compounds but also in the judgment of the metal–support interaction itself.89, 159 As already outlined in the Introduction, full structural reversal to the state prior to entering the intermetallic state is a prerequisite for an interaction to be classified as “strong” metal–support interaction.159 Nevertheless, the general inability of an intermetallic system, formed after reduction in hydrogen, to return to this initial state, has ultimately led to the introduction of the new term “reactive” metal–support interaction.1 Usually, the decomposition of the intermetallic compound is achieved through high-temperature oxidation in either oxygen or air. This oxidation treatment, however, does not typically reverse morphological and structural changes, and metal particle redispersion after sintering is only partially restored.
There are only a few cases in literature in which these issues are discussed in detail, directly via monitoring by structure-determining methods or indirectly via changes in the catalytic profiles. Juszczyk et al. investigated the transformation from Pd2Si to Pd metal and SiO2 after a high-temperature oxidation treatment and revealed a final state of partial coverage of the metal by SiO2 species.24 This was proven on the basis of catalytic measurements in n-pentane isomerization,24 depicted schematically in Figure 10. This shows the complex interplay of metal, intermetallic compound, and support under different reduction and oxidation treatments and gives hints towards a partial coverage of the metal particles by reoxidized SiO2.24 However, no direct structural proof has been provided. Similar observations have been made by Hippe et al. for the oxidative decomposition of Pt3Si/Pt12Si5 mixtures,40 who concluded the partial decoration of the metal particles by SiO2 to account for the insufficient CO chemisorption capability upon reoxidation (Figure 11, spectrum E). Pakhomov et al. reported the transformation of δ-ZnPt to ZnPt3, the initial supporting spinel and ZnO after a treatment in air at 823 K for 30 min.92 Zawadzki et al. reported decomposition of the ZnPt compound upon treatment in air at 1073 K,18 as did Ren-Yuan et al. for Al-Pt alloys.17 Sadi et al. reported that very high temperatures are necessary to invert Rh2Si intermetallic compound formation by titration with water.26 Similar arguments were also stressed by Bernal et al. for the stability of CePt5 compound particles. Even after reoxidation at 773 K, no decomposition was observed.45 A Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst showed the same behavior, although in this special case, the formation of the covering oxide layer after reoxidation seemed to be dependent on the initial degree of intermetallic compound formation. Thus, a catalyst prereduced at 523 K (with the presence of Ga2Pd5) was fully transformed to a Pd/PdO mixture after reoxidation in oxygen at 673 K, whereas deeper reduction at 673 K caused the formation of a core–shell particle with a metallic Pd core and an amorphous Ga2O3 shell after reoxidation at 673 K.58 A similar shell of In2O3 around a Pd metal particle has been observed upon oxidative decomposition of InPd.12 In contrast, there are also some reports that the decomposition of the intermetallic compound does not lead to encapsulated metal particles, but rather to a mixture of metal particles and oxide. This has been proven directly by electron microscopy for the decomposition of Pt3V, Pd3V, and Rh-V intermetallic compounds,54, 94 and for the latter additionally by changes in the selectivity patterns in CO hydrogenation.55

3.1.4. Single- and multiphase intermetallic compound formation
The discussion in this section is very much connected to the preceding section about the reaction mechanism and the stabilization of unusual particle morphologies or the influence of crystallographic aspects. It is nevertheless of high importance, especially regarding the potential technological or catalytic applications. Regarding the latter, for both fundamental scientific and more application-oriented uses, preparation and/or formation of single-phase intermetallic compounds would be highly desirable. Generally, the preparation pathway to intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction is not a very directed one and very often mixtures of several intermetallic compounds occur; this is due to a delicate interplay between thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic compound and the diffusion kinetics, which strongly depend upon the particle size. This is especially true if the compound is formed during the catalytic reaction. Some degree of steering can be achieved through crystallographic relationships, as discussed earlier, but this usually applies only to a minor number of intermetallic compounds. As the occurrence of such compounds is a frequent phenomenon in catalytic science, getting some ideas on how to judge whether single- or multiphase intermetallic compounds can be expected would be desirable. The corresponding phase diagrams are a valuable starting point, with a subsequent search for phases with high melting points, indicating highly stable intermetallic compounds. An archetypical example is the Pd-Zn phase diagram (but other valid examples are the phase diagrams of Pd-Si and Ge-Pd, strongly dominated by Pd2Si and GePd2, respectively179), which exhibits one very pronounced intermetallic compound, namely ZnPd with tetragonal structure.99 By additionally exploiting the crystallographic match between the face-centered cubic Pd and the tetragonal ZnPd structure, which is better than 92 %, it is not only possible to prepare single-phase ZnPd particles but also to structurally stabilize the particles over a wide temperature region of up to 873 K.56 This, however, is a rare example. It is more common by far that, due to the diffusion kinetics, mixtures of different intermetallic compounds are present. In addition, the kinds of phases present and the ratios between them are not only strongly time dependent (diffusion kinetics) but also depend on the applied temperature (thermodynamic stability). At best, distinct temperature regions exist, in which a single intermetallic compound prevails before it is transformed further. Focusing in detail on the individual intermetallic compounds that are reported in the literature to be formed upon the reactive metal–support interaction, experimental procedures exist for the majority of systems, which indeed allow stabilization of the compound within a well-defined temperature region. This is true for Rh3Si,21 Rh2Si,26 Pd2Si,101 Pt3Al,13, 14 CePt3,13, 14 Ni3Si23 (in this special case, for smaller particles only Ni3Si is observed, but mixtures of Ni metal and Ni3Si for larger ones), ZnPt,3–6, 48, 49, 83, 92 CePt5,89 monoclinic Pt3Si,47 Pt12Si5,15 ZnPt3,49, 92 ZnPd,3–6, 12, 52, 56, 60–63, 86, 87, 98, 99 InPd,12 In0.52Pd0.48,3–6 GaPd,58, 59 Ga2Pd5,58, 59 In2Pt,3–6 GePd2,12 In3Pd2,12 Pd2Sn,12 Pd3Sn2,12 and PdSn.12 In contrast, potential mixtures are reported for Rh3Ti/RhTi,30 Ni2Ti/Ni3Ti,154 Pt3Si (cubic and monoclinic)/Pt12Si5,15 Pt3Si/Pt12Si5,40 Pd3Si/Pd5Si,24, 27 and Ga5Pd/Ga2Pd5.3–6
Summarizing the literature, the conclusion can be drawn that the higher the amount of the corresponding main group metal in the intermetallic compound, the higher the necessary reduction temperature.
3.1.5. Influence of preparation artefacts on the formation of intermetallic compounds
A particularly important topic, which is also connected to the general assignment of intermetallic compound formation to a true reactive metal–support interaction, is related to sometimes misleading preparation artefacts of supported metal catalysts. These artefacts are usually connected with an at least partial dissolution of the oxide support in the aqueous precursor solution upon catalyst impregnation.180 Thus, an extended metal–oxide interface is created artificially, which may give rise to peculiar behavior upon heating in hydrogen at elevated temperatures. This effect is best highlighted in two examples, which present respectively the pre-intermetallic compound state and the different extent of intermetallic compound formation, if separate oxide modifications with varying solubility in water are used. Bernal et al. report on the peculiar behavior of La2O3-supported Rh particles, which show encapsulation effects (i.e., reduced La2−xO3−y species decorating the Rh particles) at surprisingly low reduction temperatures (473–573 K), given the hard reducibility of La2O3. As an explanation, which is supported by HRTEM imaging, partial dissolution of La2O3 in the aqueous Rh(NO3)3 solution is offered. In due course, the Rh particles are covered by oxidic La species, which, upon reduction, are converted to LaRhO3 perovskite and La2O2(CO3) species (Figure 12).89 Due to the intimate contact, this facilitates subsequent formation of La-Rh intermetallic compounds.

Although not always directly correlated with intermetallic compound formation, these preparation artefacts have been directly linked to peculiar intermetallic compound formation of Pd/GeO2 catalysts. For the latter, Pd particles have been impregnated on the tetragonal and hexagonal modifications of GeO2. The former is insoluble in water, but the latter slightly soluble. This different chemical behavior causes formation of GePd2 on Pd/GeO2 (tetragonal) at 673 K and GePd at 723 K (Figure 13 A). In contrast, GePd2 formation already starts at 473 K and GePd at 573 K, if Pd particles are supported on hexagonal GeO2 (Figure 13 B).12 The shift in onset temperature to lower temperatures in the latter case reflects precisely the more intimate contact between Pd and GeO2, which is established by partial dissolution of hexagonal GeO2 during catalyst preparation. In summary, these two examples highlight the importance of the extent of metal–oxide contact area for efficient intermetallic compound formation, also in view of the reaction mechanism discussed in the preceding section.

3.1.6. Particle size effects during the preparation of intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction
The kinetically motivated discussion about possible particle size effects during the preparation of oxide-supported intermetallic compounds is very much connected to the general importance and influence of the (inter)metallic–oxide interface on catalytic behavior and the formation of the intermetallic compounds in general. However, detailed studies on the particle size effects are very limited and only available for a few selected systems. Lamber and Romanowski linked the dispersion of Pt particles on SiO2 upon oxidation and reduction directly to an enhanced strong metal–support interaction.39 Lamber et al. found that the extent of Ni-Si intermetallic compound formation can be correlated directly to the Ni particle size in accordance with the increase in time needed for compound formation due to the longer diffusion paths. In due course, smaller Ni crystallites (<5 nm) were exclusively found to be fully converted to Ni3Si, but larger ones (>10 nm) only partially, that is, they contained both Ni metal and Ni3Si.23 Similar observations have been also made by Karim et al. in the Zn-Pd system.52 In this case, the particle size was also directly correlated to the CO2 selectivity in methanol steam reforming. High-temperature treatment led to complete transformation of Pd into ZnPd but the CO2 selectivity did not increase monotonically with the extent of intermetallic compound formation. Both fully transformed particles and mixed particles showed the same CO2 selectivity. However, smaller particles generally showed a lower CO2 selectivity. It was hence concluded that an increase in ZnPd particle size had no detrimental impact on the catalyst reactivity.52, 118, 147 A very similar particle size effect for ZnPd particles has been observed in the reverse water–gas shift reaction: the results indicated that the turnover frequency increased as the ZnPd crystallite size decreased.134 Also in the Pd-Ga2O3 system, a particle size effect was observed. Thus, higher reduction temperatures caused the formation of larger Ga2Pd5 particles and a generally deeper reduction of former Pd particles. However, the extent of intermetallic compound formation was not linked directly to CO2 selectivity in methanol steam reforming.58
3.2. Catalytic aspects
3.2.1. Overview of catalytic aspects
An overview of the intermetallic compounds that are encountered upon reactive metal–support interaction and the respective catalytic reactions is given in Table 2. The vast majority of intermetallic compounds are thus observed upon reductive pretreatments and only a few during the catalytic reaction itself.7–11 Regarding the former, the view on the use of intermetallic compounds for specific catalytic reactions has changed over the last few years in favor of the directed preparation of specific intermetallic compounds.1 A well-known example in this respect is the group of Pd-based intermetallic compounds, which have been found to selectively catalyze the methanol steam reforming reaction towards CO23–6 or the hydrogenation of acetylene.181 This directed approach has been fuelled by better understanding of their structural, bonding, and electronic properties in the last decade.1

With respect to that presented in Table 2, the formation of intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction is reported to have both a beneficial or detrimental effect, whereas upon deliberate preparation by prereduction, the vast majority of samples show beneficial effects. This has been reported especially for the selective dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate over ZnPd (Figure 14 A),4 the increase of the isomerization selectivity (n-pentane24 and n-heptane17, 102) over Pd3Si and AlPt catalysts, and the increase in methanation activity upon formation of ZnPt.83 Exemplarily, the n-heptane isomerization selectivity is drastically increased on AlPt from approximately 0 % before entering the intermetallic state to almost 20 % after reduction at 873 K, as shown in Figure 15. ZnPt has also been shown in detail to be a promising catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol.48, 49, 182 Rh-V intermetallic compounds (especially V3Rh5) have been shown to increase methane selectivity in CO hydrogenation.54, 55 Nevertheless, most of the data nowadays is available for a series of Pd-based intermetallic compounds, the presence of which has been shown to steer the selectivity of methanol steam reforming towards CO2 (Figure 14). † Notably, a series of comprehensive review articles especially for the archetypical ZnPd exist that highlight almost every structural and catalytic aspect in detail.2, 86, 98, 99, 103

Detrimental effects upon intermetallic compound formation have only been reported for benzene dehydrogenation over thus far compositionally unspecified PdSi phases (decrease in specific activity)35 and n-heptane conversion over ZnPt3 and ZnPt supported on Al-Zn spinels (catalyst deactivation).18
However, although the experimental catalytic results are very clear in most cases, explanations for the behavior are not usually given or based on speculation. This owes generally to the high structural and morphological complexity of the obtained systems, which very often hamper a clear addressing of the catalytic active site. This is even true for the most scrutinized Pd-based intermetallic systems in methanol steam reforming. Although the general presence of the intermetallic compounds for selective steam reforming of methanol are a widely accepted fact, the structural details of the catalytically active site are by far less clear and most probably involve interaction of the intermetallic compound with its (reduced) oxidic support.108, 109
3.2.2. Influence of the supporting oxide and the intermetallic compound–oxide interface
For a full understanding of the catalytic properties, the material has to be considered holistically. Although clear from a materials point of view, the fact that the resulting intermetallic compound is supported on a more-or-less reduced oxidic phase has been less present in the focus of discussion for most of the catalytic materials containing intermetallic compounds. Revisiting Pd-based systems, Coq et al. discussed the presence of a not-fully reduced Pd promoter in active mixed site ensembles of various catalytic reactions. This species is referred to as Pd-Mδ+ and may lead to synergistic effects, for example, in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by activation of the CO bond.183 Even in this case, it has to be emphasized that the thus created mixed sites are closely related to those typically encountered upon the reactive metal–support interaction and the associated presence of adlineation, that is, metal–oxide phase boundary, effects. Without revisiting the structural prerequisites and effects of the metal–support interaction, it is clear that the picture of the active mixed-site ensemble infers that the potentially active mixed site, for example, in the case of Pd/SiO2, is composed of structural ensembles of Pd-(SiOx)δ+-type compounds, if just the formation of migrated reduced oxide species is considered. Likewise, the presence of intermetallic compounds in contact with a reduced oxide species gives rise to mixed sites, best characterized as Pd2Si-(SiOx)δ+ or, with increasing complexity, Pd/Pd2Si-(SiOx)δ+. As a consequence, not only the metal–metal or metal–support interface but also the intermetallic compound–oxide support interface is extremely variable and the intermetallic compound–oxide interaction can no longer be neglected and, hence, must be considered for a full catalytic understanding of the catalytic ensemble. Taking this idea even further, this implies necessarily that not only the intermetallic but also the oxide itself may be structurally, morphologically, or catalytically altered. Typical manifestations include creation of surface and/or bulk defects and partial surface reduction including chemical or compositional changes. Summarizing, the actual catalytically active and selective state of such entities appears to be a composition of different potentially active sites, which goes far beyond the simple picture of an isolated intermetallic compound. Such a state would include necessarily intermetallic compounds, the intermetallic compound–oxide interface, and a more-or-less reduced state of the oxide itself.
Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of the systems, for which structural and catalytic functions of intermetallic compounds formed through the reactive metal–support interaction are discussed cooperatively, the role of the oxide is largely neglected and the catalytic properties are discussed almost solely on the basis of the pure intermetallic compound. This is surprising given that the metal–support interface has long been suspected to be important for catalytic activity. Notably, the mutual discrimination between a facilitated exchange of reactants at the interface and newly created interfacial sites is not important to highlight the general importance of the intermetallic compound–oxide interface. For the Pd/SiO2 system, Juszczyk et al. indicate the potential importance of this interface in n-pentane isomerization24 but again it is the Pd-based intermetallic compound system for which this influence of the interface is best appreciated and the transformation of the historical understanding of this class of catalyst systems from a simple to a very complex one, including the establishment of an intermetallic compound–oxide bifunctional synergism, can best be seen. In this respect, Iwasa et al., in the course of discovering the peculiar properties of the PdZn, GaPd, InPd, PtZn, GaPt, and InPt intermetallic compounds in methanol steam reforming, argued specifically in favor of the intermetallic surface-adsorbed formyl species that subsequently selectively decomposes to CO2.3 This led to the electronic picture resembling the electronic structure of copper (in the industrially used Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst) by the strongly altered electronic structure of ZnPd compared to the constituent metals.184 This match of electronic structure has in due course been verified by a number of experimental methods, including in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.185, 186 However, whereas the presence of the corresponding intermetallic compound is a prerequisite for CO2-selective steam reforming, a number of studies showed that water activation, which is of crucial importance for high CO2 selectivity, cannot proceed efficiently on the intermetallic surface and thus must involve the oxide support in some way.109, 110, 185, 187 Especially for the Pd/ZnO and Pd/Ga2O3 systems, this has been verified by structural, spectroscopic, and catalytic methods.108–110, 188 For the outstanding Pd/ZnO system, evidence has been collected by aberration-corrected electron microscopy that the simple ZnPd intermetallic compound supported on ZnO is not CO2-selective, rather the reaction-induced state of an extended ZnPd-ZnO interface, formed by ZnO surface segregation from the ZnPd particles and subsequent oxidation (Figure 16).108 Similar observations have also been made on a number of unsupported ZnPd samples.110, 185

4. Summary and Outlook
Reviewing the published studies involving the formation of intermetallic compounds through reactive metal–support interactions and the impact on the catalytic properties leads to the following conclusions. First of all, the reactive metal–support interaction occurs in a large number of catalytically interesting and relevant systems. The reactive metal–support interaction is very specific for each system, that is, the temperature upon which intermetallic compounds or alloys are formed during reduction depends not only on the combination of noble metal and supporting oxide but also upon the size of the supported noble metals, the oxide modification, and the pretreatment of the supporting oxide. In addition, the delicate interplay between thermodynamic stability of the compounds and diffusion kinetics of the second component further complicates the resulting phase composition after reduction. Taking the large amount of available data into account, the phenomenological effects of the reactive metal–support interaction are well defined. This applies to both structural and catalytic effects. Regarding the latter, the unintended reactive metal–support interaction usually has a largely detrimental effect on the catalytic activity and the selectivity towards thermodynamically less stable products increases. For potential beneficial effects, a systematic approach of exploring noble metal and oxide combinations with focus on the aforementioned parameters is needed. This, however, has not yet been attempted. The outcome of such studies would be the possibility for optimized (i.e., single-phase and with as small intermetallic particles as possible) syntheses to explore the full beneficial potential of intermetallic compounds in catalysis.
To finally revisit the definition of a “strong” metal–support interaction, it is likely that all reports of intermetallic compound formation starting from oxide-supported metal particles by partial reduction of the support cover no “strong” metal–support interaction in the strict definition of the term. This is always due to violation of the prerequisite for full reversibility of the phenomenon by reoxidation followed by mild reduction.
