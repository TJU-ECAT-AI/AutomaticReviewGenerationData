Abstract
The kinetics of the dissociation of gold oxide, Au2O3, formed by O2-plasma treatment of Au ﬁlm were examined by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by taking electrical resistance measurements. The surface resistance of the
gold ﬁlm was markedly increased by O2-plasma treatment and then gradually returned to the initial value in air at room
temperature (22 C). XPS indicated that Au2O3 can be formed by O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociated
to gold elements. The time dependence of the dissociation of Au2O3 was also analyzed by monitoring the surface re-
sistance and applying a ﬁrst-order rate equation at temperatures between 22 and 100 C; the activation energy was
calculated to be 57 kJ/mol.

Gold is the most noble of all metals due to the
lack of reactivity [1]. Golds unique properties
make it useful for fabricating some electronic
components used in semiconductor technology.
For example, it is used in ﬁrst- or second-level
metalization, and as a plating metal during the
backside processing of GaAs devices [2]. Gold is
also a highly active catalyst of the hydrogenation
of CO2 on supported metal oxides [3]. In semi-
conductor processing, O2-plasma and UV/ozone
are involved in methods by which a clean, hydro-
philic gold surface is produced [4]. Recently,
several reports have shown that oxidation easily
occurs when a gold ﬁlm is exposed in highly re-
active chemical environments, such as during O2-
plasma discharge or in UV/ozone, [4–10] typically
altering the electrical characteristics of the mate-
rial. The chemical shift of the Au-4f and O-1s
levels obtained from X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy, XPS, has been conclusively elucidated
the oxidation of gold and revealed that the oxide is
Au2O3 [5,6,9,11]. Thermodynamically, the heat of
formation (DHf) of Au2O3 is estimated to be +19.3
kJ/mol, implying that the oxide is unstable [3]. As
reported in the literature, the Au2O3 or the oxygen
atoms can be removed or dissolved by thermal
desorption spectroscopy, TDS, at above 100 C
[5,7,9,10]. However, the relationship between the
nobility of gold and the instability of its oxide

Au2O3 and the eﬀect of the oxide on the electrical
properties of gold metal remain unclear.
This work investigated the time dependence of
the dissociation process of Au2O3 at temperatures
22–100 C, by monitoring surface resistance. The
kinetics of Au2O3 dissociation were thus eluci-
dated. Au ﬁlms were deposited on 6 in. Si sub-
strates by physical vapor deposition to a thickness
of 100 nm. The Au ﬁlms were then oxidized by
exposure to O2-plasma for 1 min, and the thick-
ness of the oxide was estimated to exceed 4 nm by
XPS [9]. The gas pressure and the forward power
of the microwave were maintained at 1200 mTorr
and 600 W, respectively. The surface resistances of
the Au ﬁlms and the Au oxides were measured
using a typical four-point probe system, and the
average resistance was calculated across 52 diﬀer-
ent points on the wafer. The Au oxide was ther-
mally treated on a hot plate at a temperature of
22–100 C, to control the dissociation of the Au
oxide, which were examined in air and the mois-
ture content was maintained at 45%. Furthermore,
XPS experiments were conducted during the dis-
sociation of the Au oxide to determine the binding
of Au and O, for comparison as the surface re-
sistance changes.
Fig. 1 presents the average surface resistance of
Au2O3 ﬁlms formed by the O2-plasma treatment
of Au ﬁlms at various temperatures (22, 50, 75
and 100 C). The surface resistances are also
measured at various times and normalized to
ðRðtÞ  RminÞ= ðRmax  RminÞ (indicated by arrows),
where RðtÞ, Rmin and Rmax are the instantaneous,
minimal and maximal surface resistances, respec-
tively. The resistances clearly fall in time, before
eventually returning to their initial values. The
processes at higher temperatures proceed faster
because less time is required for the resistances to
return to their initial values. Fig. 2 and the inset
show XPS spectra that indicate that the Au-4f
and O-1s peaks were obtained from untreated
(NON-sample) and O2-plasma-treated Au ﬁlms
(D0-, D2- and D4-samples) at 22 C, where D0 is
the as-treated sample, D2 is the sample held in air
for 2 days and D4 is the sample held in air for 4
days. Each peak is ﬁtted to a Lorentzian equa-
tion. An Au reference sample was used to deﬁne
the origin of the binding energy for calibration.
Table 1 details the chemical shift of Au-4f and O-
1s levels and the related intensities. As shown in
Fig. 2, the O2-plasma as-treated Au ﬁlm (D0-
sample) has two extra peaks (Au–O1 and Au–O2,
dashed lines) at energies of 85.5 and 89.4 eV,
unlike the untreated Au ﬁlm (NON-sample), in
which the Au is bonded to O in an Au2O3
structure, as conﬁrmed in the literature [5,6,9].

The intensities of these two Au–O peaks gradually
decay when the D0-sample is held in air for 2
days (D2-sample) following O2-plasma treatment,
and the Au–O peaks completely disappear after
about 4 days (D4-sample) at 22 C, as indicated
in Table 1. For gold elements, moreover, the in-
tensities of the Au–Au1 and Au–Au2 peaks in the
D0-sample (the O2-plasma as-treated sample) de-
clined considerably, compared with the untreated
Au ﬁlm (NON-sample), due to the oxidation of
gold; but, after the as-treated sample was held in
air for 4 days (D4-sample), the intensities of Au–
Au peaks could be gradually and fully restored, as
also indicated in Table 1. These results indicate
that an Au oxide can be formed by O2-plasma
treatment of Au ﬁlm and then spontaneously and
completely dissociated in air at 22 C; and as
shown in Fig. 1 (which depicts the surface resis-
tances of the D2- and D4-samples), the dissocia-
tion process is accordingly correlated to the
decline in surface resistance. However, the ener-
gies of the Au–Au peaks of the D0-sample (83.9
eV) were also shifted from those of the NON-
sample (84.05 eV), before gradually returning to
84.05 eV as the dissociation proceeded. The shift
of the Au–Au peaks in the case of the D0-sample
is probably caused by the stress in the lattice due
to the production of the oxide [9]. The chemical
shift in the O-1s level was also determined for
NON-, D0-, D2- and D4-samples, as shown in the
inset of Fig. 2 and Table 1. The O-1s peak of the
D0-sample can be assigned to the O atom bonded
to Au in Au2O3 (530.4 ± 0.2 eV) and the O-1s
peaks of NON- and D4-samples (531.8 ± 0.2 eV)
are attributable to O in hydroxyl groups [6,9].
However, the O-1s peak of the D4-sample is
higher than that of the NON-sample, indicating
that, after Au oxide was completely dissociated,
the O atoms translated from Au2O3 remained in
the Au ﬁlms at 22 C, and were associated with
bulk oxygen, diﬀusing out of the surface at high
temperature, as has been determined by TDS [10].
The time dependence of a reaction is generally
described by a ﬁrst-order rate equation, dc=dt ¼
Kc, where c is the concentration of the reactive
species and K is the rate constant. Integration
yields c ¼ c0 expðKtÞ, where c0 is the concentra-
tion at time t ¼ 0. The surface resistances of
Au2O3 ﬁlms can be analyzed by applying the ﬁrst-
order rate equation: ðRðtÞ  RminÞ=ðRmax  RminÞ ¼
c0 expðKtÞ, where c0 is already normalized to be
unity. The data of surface resistance against time
in Fig. 1 at various temperatures, are consistent
with the ﬁrst-order rate equation (solid lines). At
22 C, the rate constant K is 0.00052 min1. The
half-life, t1=2 ¼ ln 2=K, is 22 h at 22 C and 166 h
(around 7 days) at 0 C. The activation energy for
the dissociation ðEaÞ can be determined from a
plot of lnðKÞ vs. 1=T (Arrhenius equation, ln K ¼
Ea=kT þ ln A, where k is the Boltzmann constant;
T is the temperature, and A is a factor). As shown
in the inset of Fig. 1, the activation energy ðEaÞ
was calculated from the slope to be 57 kJ/mol
(0.6 eV), which is of the same as the Au–O bond
dissociation energy [7].
In summary, the kinetics of the dissociation of
Au2O3 were elucidated by monitoring the surface
resistances that correspond to changes in the
chemical bonding in ﬁlms. Au2O3 has a short half-
life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an
activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol,
indicating instability even at low temperatures.
The results of electrical resistance also revealed
that the electrical properties are not degraded after
