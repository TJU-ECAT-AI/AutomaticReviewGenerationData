An Atomic-Scale View of Palladium Alloys and their Ability to Dissociate Molecular Hydrogen
Graphical Abstract
Coming attractions: Atomic-scale imaging is used to elucidate the composition and geometry of catalytically important Pd alloy surfaces. Ensembles responsible for hydrogen dissociation are identified along with a new hydrogen-induced 2D PdH phase that results from the transport of Pd atoms to sites on top of the surface.
Abstract
Palladium and its alloys play a central role in a wide variety of industrially important applications such as hydrogen reactions, separations, storage devices, and fuel-cell components. Alloy compositions are complex and often heterogeneous at the atomic-scale and the exact mechanisms by which many of these processes operate have yet to be discovered. Herein, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used to investigate the atomic-scale structure of Pd–Au and Pd–Cu bimetallics created by depositing Pd on both Au(111) and Cu(111) single crystals at a variety of surface temperatures. We demonstrated that individual, isolated Pd atoms in an inert Cu matrix are active for the dissociation of hydrogen and subsequent spillover onto Cu sites. Our results indicated that H spillover was facile on Pd–Cu at 420 K but that no H was found under the same H2 flux on a Pd–Au sample with identical atomic composition and geometry. In the case of Au, significant H uptake was only observed when larger ensembles of Pd were present in the form of nanoparticles. We report experimental evidence for hydrogen’s ability to reverse the tendency of Pd to segregate into the Au surface at catalytically relevant temperatures and our STM images reveal a novel H-induced striped structure in which Pd atoms aggregated on top of the surface in regularly spaced rows. These results demonstrate the powerful influence an inert substrate has on the catalytic activity of Pd atoms supported in or on its surface and reveal how the atomic-scale geometry of Pd–Au alloys is greatly affected by the presence of hydrogen.
Introduction
The unique properties of bimetallic alloys have played a major role in heterogeneous catalysis for decades. The tunability offered by mixing different elements with control over stoichiometry allows catalysts to be made with greater activity, selectivity, and stability than those derived from single metals. The superior properties of alloys are often discussed both in terms of ligand (electronic) and ensemble (geometric) effects.1–4 Ligand effects refer to the change in catalytic properties due to the electronic interactions between the two elements of a bimetallic alloy. Ensemble effects refer to the spatial distribution of atomic sites that host reactants. Some reactions require larger ensembles of reactive atoms to catalyze the transformation and are therefore halted when the active atom is dispersed throughout an inert lattice. Therefore, understanding the atomic-scale surface structure of alloys is a crucial step on the path towards designing optimal heterogeneous catalysts. Only fairly recently has the nanoscale surface structure of metal alloys begun to be reported.5–15
The two alloy systems of direct relevance to this paper are Pd–Cu(111) and Pd–Au(111). The choice of supporting metal allowed the study of Pd particles as a function of size; from individual atoms in and under the surface to islands >10 nm in diameter. Pd–Cu alloys are an important class of materials used for hydrogen purification membranes, and also serve as the active metals in many heterogeneous catalysts.16–20 Due to the technological importance of Pd–Cu alloys, a wide variety of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in order to uncover the surface physics and chemistry of these systems.8, 21–34 The bulk alloys exist in both ordered and disordered phases; however, at most catalytically relevant temperatures and compositions, the binary Pd–Cu system is a disordered fcc alloy.8, 35–37 Surface studies have shown that the top atomic layer of Pd–Cu alloys is rich in Cu, whereas the near-surface region (ca. 7 atomic layers) is rich in Pd.38 However, if there are strongly interacting adsorbates present, Pd is brought to the surface.39 Aaen et al. used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study the structure of surface alloys formed by physical vapor deposition of Pd onto Cu(111) at a variety of temperatures.8 They found that after deposition, the Pd was incorporated into the surface via ascending step edges and that the size of the Cu–Pd alloy “brims”, which formed above the Cu step edges was dependent on the size of the lower terrace.
Pd–Au alloys are useful catalysts for many reactions, including the oxidation of CO40, 41 and crotyl alcohol,42 the synthesis of vinyl acetate monomers (VAM)11, 43–46 and hydrogen peroxide,47–50 the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene,51–53 the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated hydrocarbons,54 and the electro-oxidation of ethanol.55–58 The interaction of hydrogen with Pd–Au alloys has also been studied.59–63 Active sites for reactions can vary depending on the substrate, as was shown by Goodman and co-workers with VAM synthesis. On Au(100), Pd monomer pairs were the most active site, yet on Au(111), Pd monomers were most active.3 The catalytic activity of sites varies by geometry as Pd monomers activated CO oxidation, but Pd dimers were required for hydrogen adsorption.40 Recent studies on carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions have shown that the reaction, which was originally thought to be driven by pure Au catalysts, was actually facilitated by trace amounts of Pd and the reaction yield increased in the presence of Pd0.64 This result and others motivated our work utilizing high-resolution STM to study very low concentrations of individual active atoms and small ensembles in catalytically relevant alloys at a sensitivity (<1 % surface concentration) which few other techniques are able to achieve.
We aim to understand the preferred geometries of reactive atoms at catalytically relevant temperatures and the effect of H on the aggregation and segregation of these atoms. Due to the great atomic-scale heterogeneity of the aforementioned alloy catalysts, the nature of the ensembles of the reactive element needed to promote the key steps of the reaction is often unclear. Herein, we used ultrahigh vacuum conditions to prepare well-defined surface alloys of Pd with more inert Cu and Au hosts. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy allowed us to determine the atomic-scale stoichiometry and geometry of the surface as well as the alloying mechanisms. We demonstrated how the temperature at which the elements are mixed determines the alloy composition and how metastable Pd particles can be grown on Au(111) surfaces. These results allowed us to answer questions such as: 1) What is the smallest ensemble of Pd needed to catalyze H2 dissociation? 2) How does the identity of the host metal affect spillover of H atoms? 3) Does H2 dissociation require a direct collision with the active site or are there precursor adsorption mechanisms at play? 4) How does the presence of H affect the atomic-scale geometry of the alloy?
Results and Discussion
In order to study small amounts of catalytically active Pd atoms, fairly inert Cu and Au host metals were chosen and prepared such that their defect density (0.01 %) was much lower than the concentration of Pd studied (1 %). Cu(111) single crystals have large, hexagonally packed, atomically flat terraces as shown in Figure 1. When small amounts of Pd (i.e., 0.01 monolayers (ML)) are deposited onto Cu(111), the Pd atoms diffuse across the Cu terraces until they come into contact with an ascending step edge, where alloying occurs as shown at the bottom of Figure 2. In addition, large brims form at ascending Cu step edges which contain alloyed surface and subsurface Pd for an alloy prepared at 435 K as seen in Figure 2. The insets show a STM image of a representative Pd brim and the corresponding side-view schematic of a Pd–Cu alloy prepared at a higher temperature (460 K) where surface (arrow) and subsurface (circled) Pd were imaged with atomic resolution. The brims at the top of the Cu steps are therefore Pd-rich, whereas areas beyond these brims contain mostly pure Cu(111) terraces. It has been shown that nearest neighbor Pd–Pd spacings are unfavorable and hence appear as repulsive interactions in the Pd–Cu(111) system, so while there is no long-range order in the Pd atom arrangement; all Pd atoms are isolated from each other, meaning no Pd–Pd dimers or Pd clusters exist in this system.8, 33 This result has particular relevance to our discussion of H2 dissociation on these alloys.

STM images and schematics of the Pd–Cu(111) alloy. The schematic at the bottom shows the mechanism for Pd alloying into ascending step edges via place exchange to form a Pd-rich brim. The large STM image of an alloy prepared at 435 K shows a Pd-rich brim on a Cu step edge. Imaging conditions: −0.4 V, 0.5 nA, 80 K. The atomically resolved STM image inset of a Pd–Cu alloy prepared at 460 K shows a Cu(111) lattice with subsurface (circle) and surface (arrow) Pd atoms. Imaging conditions: 0.04 V, 1 nA, 80 K, scale bar=1 nm. The schematic in the upper left hand corner shows a side-view of the alloy.
The geometry of the bare Au(111) surface is very different from that of Cu(111) due to the herringbone or 22×√3 reconstruction of Au(111), as seen in Figure 1, which provides additional entry sites for Pd atoms to alloy. At every elbow in the reconstruction, a mismatch of the atomic rows leaves undercoordinated Au atoms at an edge dislocation which serve as preferential binding sites for adsorbates. When Pd is deposited onto the Au(111) surface, it lands on the Au terraces and diffuses until it comes into contact with an edge dislocation, where it alloys into surface and subsurface sites through place exchange.67 We have also observed a limited amount of Pd alloying at the step edges. It is clear that the density of alloyed Pd atoms is greatest in the vicinity of the elbows of the herringbone reconstruction, as seen in Figure 3 b after a low coverage Pd deposition. At the temperature of this deposition (370 K), the Pd atoms reside in the topmost surface layer of Au(111).

STM images and corresponding side-view schematics of the deposition temperature dependence on Pd–Au alloy composition: a) Pd alloying occurs in the subsurface region of the Au(111) (atomic resolution) when the deposition temperature is 460 K. Imaging conditions: −0.3 V, 2 nA, 7 K; b) Atomically resolved surface Pd is seen near the edge dislocations after a deposition at 370 K. Imaging conditions: −0.5 V, 1 nA, 5 K; c) Surface Pd and Pd-rich islands are present after Pd is deposited at 290 K. Imaging conditions: 0.3 V, 0.3 nA, 80 K. All scale bars=2 nm.
The temperature of both the Cu and Au single crystals can be controlled during Pd deposition in order to vary the alloy composition. In the case of Cu(111), at higher T depositions, the majority of the Pd atoms reside in the subsurface region, whereas if the Cu(111) is at a lower T during deposition, more Pd atoms alloy into the surface layer. However at all deposition temperatures studied (290–475 K), both surface and subsurface Pd atoms were found in the Pd–Cu(111) alloy system.33 This is due to the higher surface-free energy of Pd as compared to Au and Cu leading to the segregation of Pd into the host metal (surface free energy: Au=1.63 J m−2; Cu=1.85 J m−2; Pd=2.05 J m−2).68
Careful control over the Au(111) surface temperature during deposition allows the fabrication of both stable and metastable alloyed structures that vary from hosting isolated Pd atoms in surface or subsurface layers to Pd adatom islands.67 Surface and subsurface alloying preferentially occurs at the elbows of the herringbone reconstruction through place exchange. The thermodynamic stability of surface alloying in Pd–Au systems has been demonstrated by experiments and theory.69, 70 When the surface temperature is lower during deposition, island nucleation occurs at substituted Pd surface atoms in the vicinity of the elbows. The structure of the Pd–Au alloy hosts mostly subsurface Pd atoms at 460 K (Figure 3 a), surface Pd atoms at 370 K and Pd islands at 290 K. Figure 3 b shows a Pd–Au alloy with Pd atoms in the surface of Au(111), which was prepared at 370 K.67 Depending on the temperature of the deposition, a combination of subsurface and surface Pd atoms or surface atoms and islands could be prepared. Figure 3 c shows a sample prepared at 290 K which hosts surface Pd atoms as well as Pd-rich islands, supporting the island nucleation mechanism.67, 71, 72 The fact that alloy formation proceeds through place exchange means that Au atoms are expelled from the surface as the Pd islands grow. Therefore, the Pd islands are not pure Pd, but a Pd-rich mixture of Pd–Au as shown in Figure 3.
The dynamics of Pd island motion and the mechanism of surface alloying was elucidated by STM imaging at elevated temperatures as seen in Figure 4. The sample was prepared at 320 K in order to host Pd islands on the surface of Au(111) and then the sample was annealed to 450 K to obtain the images in Figure 4. These images show that while the Pd islands are stable for many minutes, the circled islands decreased in size and eventually disappeared due to the diffusion of Pd atoms across the terrace to nearby edge dislocations or step edges where alloying occurred. The images in Figure 4 were obtained at 450 K, yet still show the presence of islands. Interestingly, if the alloy had been prepared at 450 K rather than 320 K, the Pd would be found in the surface of the Au(111).

Variable temperature STM images recorded at 450 K show the disappearance of the Pd-rich islands that occurs as Pd alloys into Au(111). These islands were grown at 320 K and subsequently annealed to 450 K. Imaging conditions: 0.3 V, 20 pA, 450 K.
It is proposed that two factors play a role in allowing Pd islands to remain somewhat stable on the surface for many minutes rather than instantly alloying. First, it is expected that fewer edge dislocations (elbows) are present on the surface of Au(111) due to the rearrangement of the herringbone reconstruction that is caused by Pd substitution.72 Place exchange occurs at the elbows, and as Pd atoms replace Au atoms, the strain within the surface lattice causes the concerted motion of a significant number of atoms that disorders and begins lifting the herringbone reconstruction,72 similar to the disorder caused by local vacancies in Au(111).73 Second, the elbows that still remain are likely covered with Pd islands, which thereby limit place exchange at the edge dislocations. Figure 5 shows large Pd islands supported on Au(111) in which parts of the herringbone reconstruction are visible under the islands, albeit at a much lower density than on pure Au(111). It has been demonstrated by Lambert that the herringbone reconstruction is not present under the Pd islands but is rather diverted around them, which we do not dispute.72 In the case reported here, the Pd deposition occurred rapidly and as a result some of the Pd islands covered the herringbone reconstruction. This is a clue to the enhanced stability of the Pd islands at elevated temperatures. We have shown that alloying occurs at edge dislocations and that there are fewer edge dislocations present in the herringbone reconstruction due to some disorder of the surface lattice. Most importantly, the edge dislocations that are present under the islands are blocked by Pd and therefore unable to participate in a vacancy-mediated place exchange mechanism that transports Pd into the Au surface. Rather, Pd atoms detach from the edges of the islands (as is observed in the concerted Ostwald ripening and shrinking of Pd islands at 450 K) and alloy into the surface at bare edge dislocations and step edges.

Imaging conditions: −0.9 V, 10 pA, 28 K.
STM has the ability to probe individual active sites, whether these sites are isolated atoms or small particles. Whereas most surface techniques average over μm2 or mm2 areas of the sample, STM can monitor adsorption and reaction at the level of single atoms and molecules. It is of great importance to obtain an accurate picture of the structure of active sites for reactions as well as knowledge of how the atomic-scale geometry of these sites changes after adsorption of catalytically relevant molecules. We investigate the ability of Pd in a variety of ensembles on both Cu and Au surfaces to dissociate H2, the diffusion pathway (spillover) of the dissociated H atoms, and how these Pd sites restructure and segregate in response to the presence of H.
The dissociation barrier for H2 on Cu(111) has been calculated to be approximately 0.5 eV74, 75 although some experiments estimated the barrier in the range of 0.3–0.4 eV.76, 77 This high barrier to H2 dissociation leads to no measurable H2 dissociation on Cu(111) up to sample temperatures of 420 K. However, when isolated Pd atoms are present in the surface of Cu(111), we have found that H2 dissociation and spillover occur, bypassing the kinetic limitation of pure Cu. The dissociation barrier of H2 over an isolated Pd atom in Cu(111) has been calculated to have a barrier of only 0.02 eV.78 Figure 6 illustrates a series of STM images of a H2 dosed Pd–Cu alloy which were recorded while moving away from the step edge shown in the first panel. The Pd-rich brim is located at the top of the step edge, similar to the Pd brim seen in Figure 2. In the first panel, depressions are seen above and below the step edge. The depressions on the lower terrace are individual H atoms that have dissociated on Pd atoms and spilled over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces. The concentration of H atoms decreased farther from the step edge (and therefore the Pd-rich brim). As can be seen from Figure 6, the H atoms are present in localized 2D clusters on the bare Cu(111) terraces. Time-lapse STM imaging at 7 K revealed the diffusion of these islands as a whole indicating attractive interactions between the individual H atoms in the clusters. It is important to note that at low Pd coverages, only isolated, individual Pd atoms were present in the Pd brims of Cu(111) and therefore H2 dissociation was activated by single, isolated Pd atoms. The large depression in Figure 6 is a defect in the Cu surface, which was used as a landmark as images were taken as a function of proximity to the step edge.

Series of low temperature STM images taken on Pd–Cu(111) after exposure to H2. The Pd brim on the upper step edge is seen on the left hand side of the first panel. Individual H atoms appear as depressions and are seen on the lower terrace after dissociation on individual Pd atoms and spillover onto the bare Cu terraces. The sequence of images was recorded moving progressively farther from the step edge to show the drop-off of H concentration, in support of our findings that H2 dissociates at Pd sites and that H atoms are stable on clean Cu(111) terraces. Imaging conditions: 0.008 V, 0.01 nA, 7 K, scale bar=20 nm.
Due to the reactivity of individual Pd atoms and the inert nature of Cu(111) for H2 dissocation, it was expected that H2 would desorb from a bare Cu surface but dissociate and spillover from Pd atoms. Considering the coverage of Pd in the Cu(111) surface (0.01 ML) and the amount of H2 dosed (10 L=10 ML), the expected coverage of H would be 0.2 ML (10 ML H2×0.01 ML Pd×2 H atoms per molecule); however, a coverage of approximately 0.5 ML H was measured experimentally by STM. Therefore, a H2 precursor state on Cu(111) must be present to explain this result. We propose that molecular H2 does not desorb from Cu(111), but remains on the surface, diffuses across terraces and only dissociates when in contact with a substituted Pd atom. Precursor-mediated adsorption is an important and sometimes overlooked issue in catalysis and surface chemistry and can have can have a significant effect on reaction kinetics. Early experiments reported anomalously high molecular sticking probabilities at high adsorbate coverages.79, 80 These results can only be explained by a weakly bound state with a long lifetime that allowed the incident molecule to move around on top of an adsorbate-covered surface until it arrived at a vacant site. These weakly bound states are referred to as extrinsic precursor states.81 At low coverages, molecules can also exist in so-called intrinsic precursor states on the bare surface if there is a large barrier to dissociative chemisorption. These states are like traps for incident molecules which allow them to diffuse far enough so that they can find reactive sites such as step edges for dissociation. The schematic in Figure 7 illustrates the proposed mechanism for the H2 precursor pathway, dissociation of H2 over Pd, and finally spillover of H atoms onto the Cu terraces.

The adsorption of a precursor state of H2 on Cu(111), diffusion of H2, followed by dissociation over an isolated Pd atom, and finally spillover of H atoms onto the Cu terrace.
In contrast to the Pd–Cu alloy, when H2 was deposited onto the Pd–Au(111) alloy containing surface or subsurface Pd atoms, H spillover onto Au sites was not observed. Our STM data revealed that Pd monomers are the most prevalent Pd species present in the surface layer of Au(111). This apparent Pd–Pd repulsion can be explained by stronger heteroatom bonds (PdAu) than PdPd or AuAu bonds making the Pd–Au system directly relatable and comparable to the aforementioned Pd–Cu alloy.65, 82 While no H spillover was observed for these individual, isolated Pd atoms in Au(111), STM images such as Figure 8 a revealed that after H2 exposure, the isolated Pd atoms appeared larger. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that H atoms are thermodynamically stable on isolated surface Pd atoms in Au(111).65, 78 The ramification of this finding is that the enlarged appearance of the Pd atoms in Figure 8 a most probably arises due to the dissociation of a H2 molecule on a Pd atom that leads to the population of two of the six available three-fold hollow sites surrounding the Pd atom with two H atoms.65, 78 Although theory predicts that the presence of H should stabilize Pd trimers in the Au(111) surface, we did not see the predicted restructuring with the first system we studied, which had a very low concentration of Pd (0.01 ML; Figure 8 a). Pd atoms would have had to diffuse over many lattice spacings to form trimers at relatively low temperature (420 K).

STM images of H/Pd–Au with different alloy compositions; a) Isolated surface Pd atoms appear larger due to the presence of atomic hydrogen but the alloy composition does not support hydrogen spillover onto Au after exposure to 10 L H2. Imaging conditions: −1 V, 1 nA, 7 K; b) A PdH striped structure emerges after Pd islands on Au(111) are exposed to 216 L H2. The PdH striped structure is present on top of both the Pd–Au terrace and Pd adatom islands. Imaging conditions: 0.4 V, 0.1 nA, 28 K.
To fabricate a Pd ensemble that could support significant H uptake on Au(111), Pd islands were grown on the surface. Increasing the surface composition of Pd increases the availability of active sites for H2 adsorption and dissociation.83, 84 As mentioned previously, these systems contain isolated Pd atoms in and under the surface in the vicinity of edge dislocations as well as Pd islands on top of the Au surface. After exposure to H2, STM imaging revealed the emergence of a new striped structure as seen in Figure 8 b due to the formation of PdH. These striped regions appeared on top of the surface in the vicinity of edge dislocations as well as on and around islands. In Figure 9, the structural differences between Pd–Au(111) without the presence of H (Figure 9 a) and after deposition of 216 L of H2 on Pd–Au(111) (Figure 9 b) are evident. Without the presence of H, Pd appeared in the form of adatom islands and as individual, isolated atoms in the surface and subsurface regions of Au(111), as seen in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 9 a. After exposure to H2, a novel striped phase of PdH was observed on and around the islands, in the vicinity of elbows and at step edges. It is important to note that before H2 exposure, the highest concentration of Pd atoms in the surface were located in the vicinity of elbows and step edges. The presence of the PdH striped structure was most prevalent on areas of the surface where Pd preferentially alloys with Au(111), such as edge dislocations, step edges, on and around Pd-rich islands.

STM images of Pd–Au(111) alloys before (a) and after (b) the exposure of 216 L H2: a) Pd islands and surface Pd (not seen in this large-scale image) are present after Pd deposition at 370 K. Imaging conditions: −0.3 V, 0.1 nA, 300 K; b) After H2 exposure, the striped PdH structure appears in the vicinity of the elbows as well as on and around the islands. The striped structure is postulated to arise when H causes Pd to be removed from the surface and aggregate in the form of PdH rows on top of the Au–Pd surface and the Pd islands. Conditions: Pd deposition at 380 K, 216 L H2 dose, 0.7 V, 50 pA, 28 K.
Hydrogen is not stable on Au(111) and, due to the fast diffusion rate of H on Pd(111) even at temperatures below 100 K,84–86 we can rule out the conclusion that the striped structures arise from H atoms adsorbed on surface Pd, as we have observed the striped phase for long periods of time at both 30 K and 290 K. DFT calculations performed for H on various geometric arrangements of Pd atoms in the Au(111) surface indicate that H atoms stabilize Pd dimers and trimers and that H adsorption has the effect of congregating isolated Pd atoms dispersed in the surface and subsurface regions into ensembles of Pd atoms in the surface layer.65 Surface Pd segregation in the presence of H on Pd–Ag alloys has also been demonstrated using DFT.87 In the case of the striped structure, we propose that H2 exposure leads to the localization of Pd atoms in the surface layer as theory predicts but also that some of these Pd atoms are pulled out of the surface and also from the Pd islands in order to form PdH rows on top of the Au terraces and Pd islands. To the best of our knowledge, this type of alloy restructuring in which the presence of H leads to ejection and ordering of atoms on the surface has never before been predicted by theory or reported experimentally.
The proposed striped structure (Figure 10) is based on the H-induced removal of Pd from the surface and islands in order to form PdH stripes on top of the Au(111) terraces and Pd islands. The inter-row spacing of the striped structure was measured to be 0.51±0.06 nm, which corresponds to √3 spacing of atoms on Au(111). The angle of the PdH rows with respect to the underlying Au(111) lattice also supported the assignment of Pd rows (or stripes) running along the close-packed direction of the substrate. The height of the Pd-rich islands before H2 adsorption is 0.22±0.03 nm, which correlated to the height of a monolayer high Pd island. It is well known that atomic H images as a depression (roughly 15 pm).84, 85 Therefore, the height of the hydride is expected to be lower than that of a Pd island. The height of the striped phase is 0.14±0.02 nm on both the terraces and the islands, which is consistent with rows of Pd atoms that are adsorbed on top of the surface and on top of the monolayer high Pd islands.

Proposed structure of the striped PdH phase. H2 exposure leads to Pd atom ejection from the surface layer and Pd islands to form PdH rows which reside on top of the Au terraces and Pd islands. The striped structure forms in the vicinity of edge dislocations, where surface Pd is present at higher concentrations in the alloy.
This striped structure is a previously unreported form of PdH as the surface phase diagram for H on pure Pd(111) presented by Salmeron contains √3×√3R30−1 H, √3×√3R30−2H, and 1×1 unit cells corresponding to Pd/H ratios of (3:1), (3:2), and (1:1), respectively but shows no evidence for restructuring of the Pd(111) surface itself.88 The PdH striped structure we propose has a unit cell of 1×√3, corresponding to rows of Pd atoms adsorbed in three-fold hollow sites on the Au(111) surface separated by one atomic row. DFT calculations performed by Jacob and co-workers indicated that the order of decreasing stability of a three-fold hollow adsorbed H atom on Pd–Au(111) would be a Pd trimer (Pd3), followed by a Pd dimer (Pd2Au) and finally an isolated Pd atom (PdAu2).65 Depending on whether the Pd stripes are adsorbed on pure Au regions or areas with Pd atoms in the surface layer would lead to the H atoms associated with the stripe being adsorbed in three-fold hollows of either Pd3 or Pd2Au composition, respectively. The stripes on the Pd island of course would be predominantly of Pd3 composition. The resolution of our data does not permit us to determine the amount of H present in the striped structures, therefore, although the schematic in Figure 10 shows one H atom associated with each Pd atom in the stripe, there is no reason why a second H atom cannot be adsorbed on the opposite side. The Jacob group theory work predicted that as long as H is in an adsorbed hollow site with at least one Pd in the PdxAu3−x ensemble, it is thermodynamically stable. We hope that similar theoretical work will elucidate the exact structure of this hydride phase on top of the Pd–Au(111) alloy surfaces. We plan to perform temperature-programmed reaction experiments to investigate how the hydrogenation chemistry of this novel 2D PdH phase differs from regular H/Pd(111) systems.
Conclusions
We have shown that ultrahigh vacuum surface preparation methods can be used to yield a range of Pd-based surface and subsurface alloys. High-resolution STM allowed us to interrogate the atomic-scale geometry of these alloys and revealed that in both Cu and Au metals, Pd tends to surround itself with host metal atoms and bury itself in subsurface sites. This can be rationalized in the case of Pd–Cu by steric repulsion of the nearest neighbor Pd atoms as well as Pd’s higher surface free energy and the formation of stronger hetero-element bonds in both cases. Depending on surface temperature during the alloying procedure, a range of metastable states of Pd can be formed including Pd atoms in the surface layer and Pd islands on Au(111). These well-defined systems allowed us to interrogate the active sites for H2 dissociation. We found that individual, isolated Pd atoms were active for the dissociation and spillover of H atoms onto Cu but not Au, as H atoms are thermodynamically stable on Cu(111) but not on Au(111). To get significant uptake of H on Pd–Au, larger ensembles of Pd were required. We found that major restructuring of the Pd–Au system occurred after exposure to hydrogen, which could be explained by strong PdH bonds reversing the tendency of Pd to segregate into the bulk. We present a previously unreported form of PdH in regularly spaced rows that we postulate form through hydrogen-induced ejection of Pd atoms from the surface. This work reveals some of the rich structural diversity of bimetallic alloys that occurs in the presence of reactants and raises the question of how these atomic-scale structures affect hydrogenation chemistry.
Experimental Section
Experiments were performed in Omicron NanoTechnology low-temperature and variable-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs. A Princeton Scientific Corporation Au(111) and MaTecK Cu(111) single crystals were prepared by many consecutive Ar+ sputter (1 keV, 12 μA) and anneal (1000 K) cycles. Pd was deposited on the substrates by resistively heating a Pd wrapped W wire while the sample was held at a set temperature. All of the scanning conditions are reported for the sample voltage. Sample temperatures are accurate to within ±10 K. Between 10 and 216 L H2 was used in the preparation chamber, where 1 L=0.13 mPa s. Etched W and cut PtIr STM tips were used to acquire images.

Introduction
The unique properties of bimetallic alloys have played a major role in heterogeneous catalysis for decades. The tunability offered by mixing different elements with control over stoichiometry allows catalysts to be made with greater activity, selectivity, and stability than those derived from single metals. The superior properties of alloys are often discussed both in terms of ligand (electronic) and ensemble (geometric) effects.1–4 Ligand effects refer to the change in catalytic properties due to the electronic interactions between the two elements of a bimetallic alloy. Ensemble effects refer to the spatial distribution of atomic sites that host reactants. Some reactions require larger ensembles of reactive atoms to catalyze the transformation and are therefore halted when the active atom is dispersed throughout an inert lattice. Therefore, understanding the atomic-scale surface structure of alloys is a crucial step on the path towards designing optimal heterogeneous catalysts. Only fairly recently has the nanoscale surface structure of metal alloys begun to be reported.5–15
The two alloy systems of direct relevance to this paper are Pd–Cu(111) and Pd–Au(111). The choice of supporting metal allowed the study of Pd particles as a function of size; from individual atoms in and under the surface to islands >10 nm in diameter. Pd–Cu alloys are an important class of materials used for hydrogen purification membranes, and also serve as the active metals in many heterogeneous catalysts.16–20 Due to the technological importance of Pd–Cu alloys, a wide variety of experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in order to uncover the surface physics and chemistry of these systems.8, 21–34 The bulk alloys exist in both ordered and disordered phases; however, at most catalytically relevant temperatures and compositions, the binary Pd–Cu system is a disordered fcc alloy.8, 35–37 Surface studies have shown that the top atomic layer of Pd–Cu alloys is rich in Cu, whereas the near-surface region (ca. 7 atomic layers) is rich in Pd.38 However, if there are strongly interacting adsorbates present, Pd is brought to the surface.39 Aaen et al. used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study the structure of surface alloys formed by physical vapor deposition of Pd onto Cu(111) at a variety of temperatures.8 They found that after deposition, the Pd was incorporated into the surface via ascending step edges and that the size of the Cu–Pd alloy “brims”, which formed above the Cu step edges was dependent on the size of the lower terrace.
Pd–Au alloys are useful catalysts for many reactions, including the oxidation of CO40, 41 and crotyl alcohol,42 the synthesis of vinyl acetate monomers (VAM)11, 43–46 and hydrogen peroxide,47–50 the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene,51–53 the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated hydrocarbons,54 and the electro-oxidation of ethanol.55–58 The interaction of hydrogen with Pd–Au alloys has also been studied.59–63 Active sites for reactions can vary depending on the substrate, as was shown by Goodman and co-workers with VAM synthesis. On Au(100), Pd monomer pairs were the most active site, yet on Au(111), Pd monomers were most active.3 The catalytic activity of sites varies by geometry as Pd monomers activated CO oxidation, but Pd dimers were required for hydrogen adsorption.40 Recent studies on carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions have shown that the reaction, which was originally thought to be driven by pure Au catalysts, was actually facilitated by trace amounts of Pd and the reaction yield increased in the presence of Pd0.64 This result and others motivated our work utilizing high-resolution STM to study very low concentrations of individual active atoms and small ensembles in catalytically relevant alloys at a sensitivity (<1 % surface concentration) which few other techniques are able to achieve.
We aim to understand the preferred geometries of reactive atoms at catalytically relevant temperatures and the effect of H on the aggregation and segregation of these atoms. Due to the great atomic-scale heterogeneity of the aforementioned alloy catalysts, the nature of the ensembles of the reactive element needed to promote the key steps of the reaction is often unclear. Herein, we used ultrahigh vacuum conditions to prepare well-defined surface alloys of Pd with more inert Cu and Au hosts. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy allowed us to determine the atomic-scale stoichiometry and geometry of the surface as well as the alloying mechanisms. We demonstrated how the temperature at which the elements are mixed determines the alloy composition and how metastable Pd particles can be grown on Au(111) surfaces. These results allowed us to answer questions such as: 1) What is the smallest ensemble of Pd needed to catalyze H2 dissociation? 2) How does the identity of the host metal affect spillover of H atoms? 3) Does H2 dissociation require a direct collision with the active site or are there precursor adsorption mechanisms at play? 4) How does the presence of H affect the atomic-scale geometry of the alloy?
Results and Discussion
In order to study small amounts of catalytically active Pd atoms, fairly inert Cu and Au host metals were chosen and prepared such that their defect density (0.01 %) was much lower than the concentration of Pd studied (1 %). Cu(111) single crystals have large, hexagonally packed, atomically flat terraces as shown in Figure 1. When small amounts of Pd (i.e., 0.01 monolayers (ML)) are deposited onto Cu(111), the Pd atoms diffuse across the Cu terraces until they come into contact with an ascending step edge, where alloying occurs as shown at the bottom of Figure 2. In addition, large brims form at ascending Cu step edges which contain alloyed surface and subsurface Pd for an alloy prepared at 435 K as seen in Figure 2. The insets show a STM image of a representative Pd brim and the corresponding side-view schematic of a Pd–Cu alloy prepared at a higher temperature (460 K) where surface (arrow) and subsurface (circled) Pd were imaged with atomic resolution. The brims at the top of the Cu steps are therefore Pd-rich, whereas areas beyond these brims contain mostly pure Cu(111) terraces. It has been shown that nearest neighbor Pd–Pd spacings are unfavorable and hence appear as repulsive interactions in the Pd–Cu(111) system, so while there is no long-range order in the Pd atom arrangement; all Pd atoms are isolated from each other, meaning no Pd–Pd dimers or Pd clusters exist in this system.8, 33 This result has particular relevance to our discussion of H2 dissociation on these alloys.

STM images and schematics of the Pd–Cu(111) alloy. The schematic at the bottom shows the mechanism for Pd alloying into ascending step edges via place exchange to form a Pd-rich brim. The large STM image of an alloy prepared at 435 K shows a Pd-rich brim on a Cu step edge. Imaging conditions: −0.4 V, 0.5 nA, 80 K. The atomically resolved STM image inset of a Pd–Cu alloy prepared at 460 K shows a Cu(111) lattice with subsurface (circle) and surface (arrow) Pd atoms. Imaging conditions: 0.04 V, 1 nA, 80 K, scale bar=1 nm. The schematic in the upper left hand corner shows a side-view of the alloy.
The geometry of the bare Au(111) surface is very different from that of Cu(111) due to the herringbone or 22×√3 reconstruction of Au(111), as seen in Figure 1, which provides additional entry sites for Pd atoms to alloy. At every elbow in the reconstruction, a mismatch of the atomic rows leaves undercoordinated Au atoms at an edge dislocation which serve as preferential binding sites for adsorbates. When Pd is deposited onto the Au(111) surface, it lands on the Au terraces and diffuses until it comes into contact with an edge dislocation, where it alloys into surface and subsurface sites through place exchange.67 We have also observed a limited amount of Pd alloying at the step edges. It is clear that the density of alloyed Pd atoms is greatest in the vicinity of the elbows of the herringbone reconstruction, as seen in Figure 3 b after a low coverage Pd deposition. At the temperature of this deposition (370 K), the Pd atoms reside in the topmost surface layer of Au(111).

STM images and corresponding side-view schematics of the deposition temperature dependence on Pd–Au alloy composition: a) Pd alloying occurs in the subsurface region of the Au(111) (atomic resolution) when the deposition temperature is 460 K. Imaging conditions: −0.3 V, 2 nA, 7 K; b) Atomically resolved surface Pd is seen near the edge dislocations after a deposition at 370 K. Imaging conditions: −0.5 V, 1 nA, 5 K; c) Surface Pd and Pd-rich islands are present after Pd is deposited at 290 K. Imaging conditions: 0.3 V, 0.3 nA, 80 K. All scale bars=2 nm.
The temperature of both the Cu and Au single crystals can be controlled during Pd deposition in order to vary the alloy composition. In the case of Cu(111), at higher T depositions, the majority of the Pd atoms reside in the subsurface region, whereas if the Cu(111) is at a lower T during deposition, more Pd atoms alloy into the surface layer. However at all deposition temperatures studied (290–475 K), both surface and subsurface Pd atoms were found in the Pd–Cu(111) alloy system.33 This is due to the higher surface-free energy of Pd as compared to Au and Cu leading to the segregation of Pd into the host metal (surface free energy: Au=1.63 J m−2; Cu=1.85 J m−2; Pd=2.05 J m−2).68
Careful control over the Au(111) surface temperature during deposition allows the fabrication of both stable and metastable alloyed structures that vary from hosting isolated Pd atoms in surface or subsurface layers to Pd adatom islands.67 Surface and subsurface alloying preferentially occurs at the elbows of the herringbone reconstruction through place exchange. The thermodynamic stability of surface alloying in Pd–Au systems has been demonstrated by experiments and theory.69, 70 When the surface temperature is lower during deposition, island nucleation occurs at substituted Pd surface atoms in the vicinity of the elbows. The structure of the Pd–Au alloy hosts mostly subsurface Pd atoms at 460 K (Figure 3 a), surface Pd atoms at 370 K and Pd islands at 290 K. Figure 3 b shows a Pd–Au alloy with Pd atoms in the surface of Au(111), which was prepared at 370 K.67 Depending on the temperature of the deposition, a combination of subsurface and surface Pd atoms or surface atoms and islands could be prepared. Figure 3 c shows a sample prepared at 290 K which hosts surface Pd atoms as well as Pd-rich islands, supporting the island nucleation mechanism.67, 71, 72 The fact that alloy formation proceeds through place exchange means that Au atoms are expelled from the surface as the Pd islands grow. Therefore, the Pd islands are not pure Pd, but a Pd-rich mixture of Pd–Au as shown in Figure 3.
The dynamics of Pd island motion and the mechanism of surface alloying was elucidated by STM imaging at elevated temperatures as seen in Figure 4. The sample was prepared at 320 K in order to host Pd islands on the surface of Au(111) and then the sample was annealed to 450 K to obtain the images in Figure 4. These images show that while the Pd islands are stable for many minutes, the circled islands decreased in size and eventually disappeared due to the diffusion of Pd atoms across the terrace to nearby edge dislocations or step edges where alloying occurred. The images in Figure 4 were obtained at 450 K, yet still show the presence of islands. Interestingly, if the alloy had been prepared at 450 K rather than 320 K, the Pd would be found in the surface of the Au(111).

Variable temperature STM images recorded at 450 K show the disappearance of the Pd-rich islands that occurs as Pd alloys into Au(111). These islands were grown at 320 K and subsequently annealed to 450 K. Imaging conditions: 0.3 V, 20 pA, 450 K.
It is proposed that two factors play a role in allowing Pd islands to remain somewhat stable on the surface for many minutes rather than instantly alloying. First, it is expected that fewer edge dislocations (elbows) are present on the surface of Au(111) due to the rearrangement of the herringbone reconstruction that is caused by Pd substitution.72 Place exchange occurs at the elbows, and as Pd atoms replace Au atoms, the strain within the surface lattice causes the concerted motion of a significant number of atoms that disorders and begins lifting the herringbone reconstruction,72 similar to the disorder caused by local vacancies in Au(111).73 Second, the elbows that still remain are likely covered with Pd islands, which thereby limit place exchange at the edge dislocations. Figure 5 shows large Pd islands supported on Au(111) in which parts of the herringbone reconstruction are visible under the islands, albeit at a much lower density than on pure Au(111). It has been demonstrated by Lambert that the herringbone reconstruction is not present under the Pd islands but is rather diverted around them, which we do not dispute.72 In the case reported here, the Pd deposition occurred rapidly and as a result some of the Pd islands covered the herringbone reconstruction. This is a clue to the enhanced stability of the Pd islands at elevated temperatures. We have shown that alloying occurs at edge dislocations and that there are fewer edge dislocations present in the herringbone reconstruction due to some disorder of the surface lattice. Most importantly, the edge dislocations that are present under the islands are blocked by Pd and therefore unable to participate in a vacancy-mediated place exchange mechanism that transports Pd into the Au surface. Rather, Pd atoms detach from the edges of the islands (as is observed in the concerted Ostwald ripening and shrinking of Pd islands at 450 K) and alloy into the surface at bare edge dislocations and step edges.

Imaging conditions: −0.9 V, 10 pA, 28 K.
STM has the ability to probe individual active sites, whether these sites are isolated atoms or small particles. Whereas most surface techniques average over μm2 or mm2 areas of the sample, STM can monitor adsorption and reaction at the level of single atoms and molecules. It is of great importance to obtain an accurate picture of the structure of active sites for reactions as well as knowledge of how the atomic-scale geometry of these sites changes after adsorption of catalytically relevant molecules. We investigate the ability of Pd in a variety of ensembles on both Cu and Au surfaces to dissociate H2, the diffusion pathway (spillover) of the dissociated H atoms, and how these Pd sites restructure and segregate in response to the presence of H.
The dissociation barrier for H2 on Cu(111) has been calculated to be approximately 0.5 eV74, 75 although some experiments estimated the barrier in the range of 0.3–0.4 eV.76, 77 This high barrier to H2 dissociation leads to no measurable H2 dissociation on Cu(111) up to sample temperatures of 420 K. However, when isolated Pd atoms are present in the surface of Cu(111), we have found that H2 dissociation and spillover occur, bypassing the kinetic limitation of pure Cu. The dissociation barrier of H2 over an isolated Pd atom in Cu(111) has been calculated to have a barrier of only 0.02 eV.78 Figure 6 illustrates a series of STM images of a H2 dosed Pd–Cu alloy which were recorded while moving away from the step edge shown in the first panel. The Pd-rich brim is located at the top of the step edge, similar to the Pd brim seen in Figure 2. In the first panel, depressions are seen above and below the step edge. The depressions on the lower terrace are individual H atoms that have dissociated on Pd atoms and spilled over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces. The concentration of H atoms decreased farther from the step edge (and therefore the Pd-rich brim). As can be seen from Figure 6, the H atoms are present in localized 2D clusters on the bare Cu(111) terraces. Time-lapse STM imaging at 7 K revealed the diffusion of these islands as a whole indicating attractive interactions between the individual H atoms in the clusters. It is important to note that at low Pd coverages, only isolated, individual Pd atoms were present in the Pd brims of Cu(111) and therefore H2 dissociation was activated by single, isolated Pd atoms. The large depression in Figure 6 is a defect in the Cu surface, which was used as a landmark as images were taken as a function of proximity to the step edge.

Series of low temperature STM images taken on Pd–Cu(111) after exposure to H2. The Pd brim on the upper step edge is seen on the left hand side of the first panel. Individual H atoms appear as depressions and are seen on the lower terrace after dissociation on individual Pd atoms and spillover onto the bare Cu terraces. The sequence of images was recorded moving progressively farther from the step edge to show the drop-off of H concentration, in support of our findings that H2 dissociates at Pd sites and that H atoms are stable on clean Cu(111) terraces. Imaging conditions: 0.008 V, 0.01 nA, 7 K, scale bar=20 nm.
Due to the reactivity of individual Pd atoms and the inert nature of Cu(111) for H2 dissocation, it was expected that H2 would desorb from a bare Cu surface but dissociate and spillover from Pd atoms. Considering the coverage of Pd in the Cu(111) surface (0.01 ML) and the amount of H2 dosed (10 L=10 ML), the expected coverage of H would be 0.2 ML (10 ML H2×0.01 ML Pd×2 H atoms per molecule); however, a coverage of approximately 0.5 ML H was measured experimentally by STM. Therefore, a H2 precursor state on Cu(111) must be present to explain this result. We propose that molecular H2 does not desorb from Cu(111), but remains on the surface, diffuses across terraces and only dissociates when in contact with a substituted Pd atom. Precursor-mediated adsorption is an important and sometimes overlooked issue in catalysis and surface chemistry and can have can have a significant effect on reaction kinetics. Early experiments reported anomalously high molecular sticking probabilities at high adsorbate coverages.79, 80 These results can only be explained by a weakly bound state with a long lifetime that allowed the incident molecule to move around on top of an adsorbate-covered surface until it arrived at a vacant site. These weakly bound states are referred to as extrinsic precursor states.81 At low coverages, molecules can also exist in so-called intrinsic precursor states on the bare surface if there is a large barrier to dissociative chemisorption. These states are like traps for incident molecules which allow them to diffuse far enough so that they can find reactive sites such as step edges for dissociation. The schematic in Figure 7 illustrates the proposed mechanism for the H2 precursor pathway, dissociation of H2 over Pd, and finally spillover of H atoms onto the Cu terraces.

The adsorption of a precursor state of H2 on Cu(111), diffusion of H2, followed by dissociation over an isolated Pd atom, and finally spillover of H atoms onto the Cu terrace.
In contrast to the Pd–Cu alloy, when H2 was deposited onto the Pd–Au(111) alloy containing surface or subsurface Pd atoms, H spillover onto Au sites was not observed. Our STM data revealed that Pd monomers are the most prevalent Pd species present in the surface layer of Au(111). This apparent Pd–Pd repulsion can be explained by stronger heteroatom bonds (PdAu) than PdPd or AuAu bonds making the Pd–Au system directly relatable and comparable to the aforementioned Pd–Cu alloy.65, 82 While no H spillover was observed for these individual, isolated Pd atoms in Au(111), STM images such as Figure 8 a revealed that after H2 exposure, the isolated Pd atoms appeared larger. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that H atoms are thermodynamically stable on isolated surface Pd atoms in Au(111).65, 78 The ramification of this finding is that the enlarged appearance of the Pd atoms in Figure 8 a most probably arises due to the dissociation of a H2 molecule on a Pd atom that leads to the population of two of the six available three-fold hollow sites surrounding the Pd atom with two H atoms.65, 78 Although theory predicts that the presence of H should stabilize Pd trimers in the Au(111) surface, we did not see the predicted restructuring with the first system we studied, which had a very low concentration of Pd (0.01 ML; Figure 8 a). Pd atoms would have had to diffuse over many lattice spacings to form trimers at relatively low temperature (420 K).

STM images of H/Pd–Au with different alloy compositions; a) Isolated surface Pd atoms appear larger due to the presence of atomic hydrogen but the alloy composition does not support hydrogen spillover onto Au after exposure to 10 L H2. Imaging conditions: −1 V, 1 nA, 7 K; b) A PdH striped structure emerges after Pd islands on Au(111) are exposed to 216 L H2. The PdH striped structure is present on top of both the Pd–Au terrace and Pd adatom islands. Imaging conditions: 0.4 V, 0.1 nA, 28 K.
To fabricate a Pd ensemble that could support significant H uptake on Au(111), Pd islands were grown on the surface. Increasing the surface composition of Pd increases the availability of active sites for H2 adsorption and dissociation.83, 84 As mentioned previously, these systems contain isolated Pd atoms in and under the surface in the vicinity of edge dislocations as well as Pd islands on top of the Au surface. After exposure to H2, STM imaging revealed the emergence of a new striped structure as seen in Figure 8 b due to the formation of PdH. These striped regions appeared on top of the surface in the vicinity of edge dislocations as well as on and around islands. In Figure 9, the structural differences between Pd–Au(111) without the presence of H (Figure 9 a) and after deposition of 216 L of H2 on Pd–Au(111) (Figure 9 b) are evident. Without the presence of H, Pd appeared in the form of adatom islands and as individual, isolated atoms in the surface and subsurface regions of Au(111), as seen in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 9 a. After exposure to H2, a novel striped phase of PdH was observed on and around the islands, in the vicinity of elbows and at step edges. It is important to note that before H2 exposure, the highest concentration of Pd atoms in the surface were located in the vicinity of elbows and step edges. The presence of the PdH striped structure was most prevalent on areas of the surface where Pd preferentially alloys with Au(111), such as edge dislocations, step edges, on and around Pd-rich islands.

STM images of Pd–Au(111) alloys before (a) and after (b) the exposure of 216 L H2: a) Pd islands and surface Pd (not seen in this large-scale image) are present after Pd deposition at 370 K. Imaging conditions: −0.3 V, 0.1 nA, 300 K; b) After H2 exposure, the striped PdH structure appears in the vicinity of the elbows as well as on and around the islands. The striped structure is postulated to arise when H causes Pd to be removed from the surface and aggregate in the form of PdH rows on top of the Au–Pd surface and the Pd islands. Conditions: Pd deposition at 380 K, 216 L H2 dose, 0.7 V, 50 pA, 28 K.
Hydrogen is not stable on Au(111) and, due to the fast diffusion rate of H on Pd(111) even at temperatures below 100 K,84–86 we can rule out the conclusion that the striped structures arise from H atoms adsorbed on surface Pd, as we have observed the striped phase for long periods of time at both 30 K and 290 K. DFT calculations performed for H on various geometric arrangements of Pd atoms in the Au(111) surface indicate that H atoms stabilize Pd dimers and trimers and that H adsorption has the effect of congregating isolated Pd atoms dispersed in the surface and subsurface regions into ensembles of Pd atoms in the surface layer.65 Surface Pd segregation in the presence of H on Pd–Ag alloys has also been demonstrated using DFT.87 In the case of the striped structure, we propose that H2 exposure leads to the localization of Pd atoms in the surface layer as theory predicts but also that some of these Pd atoms are pulled out of the surface and also from the Pd islands in order to form PdH rows on top of the Au terraces and Pd islands. To the best of our knowledge, this type of alloy restructuring in which the presence of H leads to ejection and ordering of atoms on the surface has never before been predicted by theory or reported experimentally.
The proposed striped structure (Figure 10) is based on the H-induced removal of Pd from the surface and islands in order to form PdH stripes on top of the Au(111) terraces and Pd islands. The inter-row spacing of the striped structure was measured to be 0.51±0.06 nm, which corresponds to √3 spacing of atoms on Au(111). The angle of the PdH rows with respect to the underlying Au(111) lattice also supported the assignment of Pd rows (or stripes) running along the close-packed direction of the substrate. The height of the Pd-rich islands before H2 adsorption is 0.22±0.03 nm, which correlated to the height of a monolayer high Pd island. It is well known that atomic H images as a depression (roughly 15 pm).84, 85 Therefore, the height of the hydride is expected to be lower than that of a Pd island. The height of the striped phase is 0.14±0.02 nm on both the terraces and the islands, which is consistent with rows of Pd atoms that are adsorbed on top of the surface and on top of the monolayer high Pd islands.

Proposed structure of the striped PdH phase. H2 exposure leads to Pd atom ejection from the surface layer and Pd islands to form PdH rows which reside on top of the Au terraces and Pd islands. The striped structure forms in the vicinity of edge dislocations, where surface Pd is present at higher concentrations in the alloy.
This striped structure is a previously unreported form of PdH as the surface phase diagram for H on pure Pd(111) presented by Salmeron contains √3×√3R30−1 H, √3×√3R30−2H, and 1×1 unit cells corresponding to Pd/H ratios of (3:1), (3:2), and (1:1), respectively but shows no evidence for restructuring of the Pd(111) surface itself.88 The PdH striped structure we propose has a unit cell of 1×√3, corresponding to rows of Pd atoms adsorbed in three-fold hollow sites on the Au(111) surface separated by one atomic row. DFT calculations performed by Jacob and co-workers indicated that the order of decreasing stability of a three-fold hollow adsorbed H atom on Pd–Au(111) would be a Pd trimer (Pd3), followed by a Pd dimer (Pd2Au) and finally an isolated Pd atom (PdAu2).65 Depending on whether the Pd stripes are adsorbed on pure Au regions or areas with Pd atoms in the surface layer would lead to the H atoms associated with the stripe being adsorbed in three-fold hollows of either Pd3 or Pd2Au composition, respectively. The stripes on the Pd island of course would be predominantly of Pd3 composition. The resolution of our data does not permit us to determine the amount of H present in the striped structures, therefore, although the schematic in Figure 10 shows one H atom associated with each Pd atom in the stripe, there is no reason why a second H atom cannot be adsorbed on the opposite side. The Jacob group theory work predicted that as long as H is in an adsorbed hollow site with at least one Pd in the PdxAu3−x ensemble, it is thermodynamically stable. We hope that similar theoretical work will elucidate the exact structure of this hydride phase on top of the Pd–Au(111) alloy surfaces. We plan to perform temperature-programmed reaction experiments to investigate how the hydrogenation chemistry of this novel 2D PdH phase differs from regular H/Pd(111) systems.
Conclusions
We have shown that ultrahigh vacuum surface preparation methods can be used to yield a range of Pd-based surface and subsurface alloys. High-resolution STM allowed us to interrogate the atomic-scale geometry of these alloys and revealed that in both Cu and Au metals, Pd tends to surround itself with host metal atoms and bury itself in subsurface sites. This can be rationalized in the case of Pd–Cu by steric repulsion of the nearest neighbor Pd atoms as well as Pd’s higher surface free energy and the formation of stronger hetero-element bonds in both cases. Depending on surface temperature during the alloying procedure, a range of metastable states of Pd can be formed including Pd atoms in the surface layer and Pd islands on Au(111). These well-defined systems allowed us to interrogate the active sites for H2 dissociation. We found that individual, isolated Pd atoms were active for the dissociation and spillover of H atoms onto Cu but not Au, as H atoms are thermodynamically stable on Cu(111) but not on Au(111). To get significant uptake of H on Pd–Au, larger ensembles of Pd were required. We found that major restructuring of the Pd–Au system occurred after exposure to hydrogen, which could be explained by strong PdH bonds reversing the tendency of Pd to segregate into the bulk. We present a previously unreported form of PdH in regularly spaced rows that we postulate form through hydrogen-induced ejection of Pd atoms from the surface. This work reveals some of the rich structural diversity of bimetallic alloys that occurs in the presence of reactants and raises the question of how these atomic-scale structures affect hydrogenation chemistry.
Experimental Section
Experiments were performed in Omicron NanoTechnology low-temperature and variable-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs. A Princeton Scientific Corporation Au(111) and MaTecK Cu(111) single crystals were prepared by many consecutive Ar+ sputter (1 keV, 12 μA) and anneal (1000 K) cycles. Pd was deposited on the substrates by resistively heating a Pd wrapped W wire while the sample was held at a set temperature. All of the scanning conditions are reported for the sample voltage. Sample temperatures are accurate to within ±10 K. Between 10 and 216 L H2 was used in the preparation chamber, where 1 L=0.13 mPa s. Etched W and cut PtIr STM tips were used to acquire images.
