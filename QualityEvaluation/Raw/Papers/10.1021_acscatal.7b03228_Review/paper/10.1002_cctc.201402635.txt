1. Introduction
Bi- or multimetallic systems, and among them intermetallic
compounds, represent an interesting class of materials in catal-
ysis due to their structural and electronic properties, rendering
them promising catalysts for a range of reduction or oxidation
reactions.[1,2] A multimetallic system might be either a structur-
ally well-defined intermetallic compound (defined as a chemical
compound of two or more metals with a crystal structure dif-
ferent from the constituting metals; characteristic is the pres-
ence of covalent and/or ionic bonds) or a substitutional alloy
(defined by a material composed of at least two elements as
a single- or multiphase solid solution), depending on the corre-
sponding phase diagram.[1] Whereas recent experimental and
quantum mechanical studies focus on the knowledge-based
matching of intermetallic compounds and catalytic reactions,[1]
a thorough literature review reveals that intermetallic com-
pounds are much more frequently encountered than previous-
ly assumed (for a comprehensive overview of the use of inter-
metallic compounds in catalysis, we refer to Refs. [1,2]). This
comprises instances of intermetallic compounds deliberately
prepared to exploit distinct structural or electronic properties
(e.g., with the well-known preparation of the supported inter-
metallic compound ZnPd for CO2-selective steam reforming[3–6])
and materials in which unintended intermetallic compound
formation occurs as a result of their preparation or application
under catalytic reaction conditions.[7–12] Notably, the latter case
represents the overwhelming majority of intermetallic com-
pounds discussed in the catalytic community. Supported inter-
metallic compounds are prepared deliberately either through
1) promotion or modification of an oxide-supported metal
(particle) with a second metal[1] by reaction with a highly reac-
tive reagent or 2) the oxide support itself taking part in the for-
mation during the preparation of the intermetallic com-
pound.[1] It is the latter example, which often creates the struc-
turally and electronically most complex scenarios, on which
this Review is focused. Adding the metal atoms of the (usually
oxidic) support as a reactant in the preparation of intermetallic
compounds requires in most cases the reduction of the oxide
at elevated temperatures by hydrogen (explicitly discussed for
example, in Refs. [13–15]). There are many examples of this
kind in the literature with seemingly endless combinations of
noble metal and oxide support.[1,13–158] The chemical properties
of the supporting oxide usually determine the requirements
for intermetallic compound formation under given reduction
conditions and are in most cases the source of complexi-
ty.[1,13–15,159] This is mainly due to the general presence of
metal–support interactions and especially “strong metal–sup-
port interactions” (SMSI).[160–164] The latter term, coined by Taus-
ter et al., is reserved for structural rearrangements and elec-
tronic changes occurring exclusively upon reduction in hydro-
gen at elevated temperatures in the presence of easily reduced
oxides such as TiO2 or CeO2.[159] Hard-to-reduce oxides such as
SiO2 or Al2O3 were excluded. Although this appears to be a con-
venient term to also describe the formation of intermetallic
compounds from supported metal nanoparticles, its use does
not come without strings attached and finally led to the intro-
duction of the new term “reactive metal–support interaction”.[1]
Reactive metal–support interaction refers to a chemical reac-
tion process occurring on the metal–oxide interface but under
extremely harsh conditions (i.e., at very high temperatures
upon reduction in hydrogen), in many cases leading to the for-
mation of intermetallic compounds or alloys. To classify
a metal–support interaction as “strong”, three strict require-
ments must be met: 1) the catalyst shows conventional chemi-
cal behavior at low reduction temperatures, 2) upon increasing
the reduction temperature, the chemisorption capability of the
dispersed metal phase towards “classic” probe molecules such
as hydrogen or carbon monoxide is disturbed along with sub-
stantial changes in its catalytic behavior, and, most importantly,
3) the phenomenon must be fully reversible, that is, reoxida-
tion at an appropriate temperature followed by mild rereduc-
tion reestablishes the catalytic behavior prior to entering the
SMSI state.[159] The strong metal–support interaction is thought
to originate from perturbations associated with electronic in-
teractions (also localized) between the dispersed metal phase
and reduced oxide support and loss of active metal area by en-
capsulation, decoration, and support migration (i.e., the active
centers for chemisorption at the metal surface are blocked at
This Review discusses the structural and catalytic aspects of
the recently introduced reactive metal–support interaction.
This special term was coined to account for the inability of the
original concept of the strong metal–support interaction to ac-
curately describe the structural, compositional, and electronic
changes frequently occurring in oxide-supported metal particle
catalysts at very high temperatures upon reduction in hydro-
gen, in many cases leading to intermetallic compound or sub-
stitutional
alloy
formation.
This
inaccuracy
predominantly
refers to the requirement of full reversibility upon oxidation
and mild reduction for a “strong” metal–support interaction. A
close look at the formation of oxide-supported intermetallic
compounds upon high-temperature reduction reveals that
these compounds are very common in catalysis and the situa-
tion is much more complex compared to unsupported inter-
metallic compounds due to the presence of the intermetallic
compound–oxide interface.

high reduction temperatures by partial coverage by a thin
layer of the reduced oxide support).[162,165] A tentative overview
of the effects of the degree of metal–support interaction on
chemisorption, catalytic patterns, and structure, including as
an extreme case the formation of intermetallic compounds, is
presented in Figure 1.
Focusing on the intermetallic compound and/or alloy forma-
tion as the most extreme case of “strong” metal–support inter-
action, requirement 3) is not usually fulfilled. Decomposition of
intermetallic compounds is only possible by using harsh oxida-
tion treatments, which do not restore the structural and elec-
tronic properties to those before entering the intermetallic
state.[1] Although the term “strong metal–support interaction”
is therefore misleading and should be avoided, its structural
and electronic manifestations offer a convenient pathway to
discuss the inherent complexity of oxide-supported intermetal-
lic compounds. This complexity might include both structural
and catalytic aspects. For oxidation reactions, this is in most
cases due to the presence of an intermetallic compound–oxide
interface, which forms on entering the intermetallic state upon
reduction. The reaction between the supported metal and the
metal resulting from the reduction of the support leads to
a set of questions, which are important for the properties of
the materials: Which new phase(s) form? Which crystallograph-
ic and electronic structure results? Do the particles realize
unusual particle morphologies? Do they grow topotactically?
Is the intermetallic compound stable under reaction condi-
tions? How does the reducibility of the support affect the in-
termetallic compound formation and does the preparation of
the catalyst affect the extent of intermetallic compound forma-
tion?
The importance of addressing these questions becomes
clear after considering the effects on the catalytic properties,
such as changes in catalytic activity or selectivity upon enter-
ing the intermetallic compound state. Also, the influence of
the newly created interface (i.e., are special sites at the inter-
face created upon entering the intermetallic state?) on the cat-
alytic properties might be important.
By comparative studies of supported and unsupported inter-
metallic compounds, the question of whether the intermetallic
compounds are the catalytically active and selective phases or
just a part of a larger synergistic catalytic entity can be investi-
gated, answering also the question of whether the supporting
oxide contributes to the catalytic properties. In the larger con-
text, the question of which reactions would be influenced by
intermetallic formation can be answered.

A very important issue, also concerning the judgement of
whether a strong metal–support interaction in a strict defini-
tion of the term or a reactive metal–support interaction is pres-
ent, is related to the general formation mechanism of the in-
termetallic compound. Considering that the initial pre-interme-
tallic state of the catalyst is oxide-supported metal particles,
four possible mechanisms are discussed in literature:
Equation (1) A direct reaction between the noble metal and
the oxide to the corresponding intermetallic compound and
the associated noble metal oxide, for example:[21]
Mx þ SiO2 ! MySi þ MxyO2
ð1Þ
Equation (2) A surface-specific reaction at the oxide–metal
contact via chemisorbed oxygen on the metal surface, for ex-
ample:[21]
x MdþOSiO ! MxSi þ O2 " þðx1Þ SiO2
ð2Þ
Equation (3) A reaction via hydroxylated surface species, for
example:[101]
2 Pd þ SiOH þ 1=2 H2 ! Pd2Si þ H2O
ð3Þ
Equation (4) A direct reaction by reduction of the oxide in
hydrogen, for example:[26,101]
2 Pd þ SiO2 þ 2 H2 ! Pd2Si þ 2 H2O
ð4Þ
Notably, the first two mechanisms do not require hydrogen
for formation of the intermetallic compound. Indeed, the most
crucial component determining the pathway of intermetallic
compound formation is the supporting oxide, and, more spe-
cifically, its thermodynamic stability and the resulting reducibil-
ity. The first two mechanisms have been solely discussed for
the hydrogen-free formation of MSi intermetallic compounds
by simple thermal annealing. Furthermore, due to the very
high formation enthalpy of SiO2, the first mechanism has been
discarded explicitly for Rh-SiO2
[21] and Cu-SiO2 systems.[25] In
contrast, the prevalence of a mechanism that includes at least
partial reduction of the support is nowadays favored and has
been stated explicitly for Pt on SiO2,[13–15,29] Al2O3,
[13,14] CeO2,[13,14]
VOx,[94] and TiO2,[113] Pd on SiO2,[56,101] and Rh on SiO2,[26] CeO2,[53]
ZnO,[56] and V2O3.[54,55,76] Surface-specific mechanisms have
been held accountable for the formation of CuSi[25] and Rh
Si.[21] The formation of the intermetallic compounds most prob-
ably includes the following reaction steps: 1) reduction of the
oxidic support in the vicinity of the supported particles by hy-
drogen activated on the latter, 2) diffusion of these metallic
species into the noble metal lattice and 3) formation of the re-
spective intermetallic compound(s). For efficient formation of
intermetallic compounds, steady removal of the formed water
is a prerequisite, as is effective hydrogen activation on the
noble metal surface.[13–15] Notably, evidence for this reaction
mechanism has been collected for Pt particles on SiO2
(Figure 2).[15] Parts A and B of Figure 2 show Pt particles on
SiO2 in the as-grown state (part A) and after reduction at 873 K
(part B), in which a and b denote reconstructed and irregular
intermetallic Pt3Si and Pt12Si5 particles, respectively. In this spe-
cial case, electron energy loss spectroscopy (part C) reveals not
only clear indications of SiO2 reduction but also clear differen-
ces in the extent of reduction as a function of distance from
the metal particles. Thus, SiO2 far away from the metal parti-
cles (and hence, far away from dissociatively activated hydro-
gen) only shows minor signs of reduction, whereas SiO2 close
to the metal surface shows clear indications of distortion of
the SiO2 building blocks by hydrogen reduction.[15] The necessi-
ty for dissociatively activated hydrogen has also been stressed
by Lamber explicitly for the formation of Pt2Si compounds.[29]
Notably, a possible reaction mechanism must also include ki-
netic diffusion limitations of the second metal phase to ac-
count for the formation of compound mixtures and particle
size effects, as observed in a number of intermetallic com-
pound systems (for details we refer to the following sections).
To highlight the possibility and feasibility of intermetallic
compound formation, we will focus briefly on the thermody-
namics of the Pt/SiO2 system discussed in Refs. [13,14]. For the
reaction shown in Equation (5), the standard reaction enthalpy
at 900 K is +393 kJmol1 (this can be calculated simply from
the formation enthalpies of the reactants, including the one
for Pt3Si, which can be calculated by using DFT to be
115.9 kJmol1).[13,14]

The standard formation entropy of the intermetallic compound
is not known, but it is possible to give a rough estimate from
the standard formation entropy of the isostructural Cu3Au
compound (+238.6 Jmol1). The free reaction enthalpy at
900 K is therefore +178 kJmol1, resulting in an equilibrium
constant of 4.51011, indicating a highly endergonic reaction.
Under the given experimental conditions (reactor volume
16 mL),[13,14] a water pressure of approximately 103 bar is built
up at a hydrogen pressure of 1 bar. However, as the reduction
experiments are performed under flowing conditions, the
water is permanently removed, thus, the water partial pressure
is kept on a low level and the reaction forced towards the
products. Water formation occurs predominantly at the Pt–SiO2
interface by reaction of diffusing atomic hydrogen with the
SiO2 substrate. The high formation energy and high stability of
the intermetallic compounds formed also applies to com-
pounds of differing stoichiometry, for example, 127.8 kJmol1
for a PtSi phase. Similar arguments also hold for the corre-
sponding Pt3Al (equilibrium constant 1.3109)[13,14] and Pt3Ce
(equilibrium constant 2.4106)[13,14] compounds. In all these
cases, classical thermodynamics does not limit intermetallic
compound formation because the experimental setup allows
for permanent removal of reactant water.
As for the thermodynamics of supporting oxide reduction,
this is basically dominated by the standard formation enthal-
pies of the oxides under question: for the Al2O3 and CeO2 ex-
amples discussed above, these enthalpies are 1651 kJmol1
and 1085 kJmol1, respectively, indicating that intermetallic
compound formation requires higher temperatures on Al2O3,
corroborating the experimental results. Supporting the noble
metals on oxides with smaller formation enthalpies, for exam-
ple, the use of ZnO, GeO2, or Fe2O3 results in much lower tem-
peratures
required
for
the
formation
of
intermetallic
compounds.
This Review tries to summarize the present dispersed and
far from systematic knowledge on the preparation of support-
ed intermetallic compounds via the reactive metal–support in-
teraction. In addition, the complexity of such systems is high-
lighted, also addressing structural and catalytic aspects in se-
lected examples. Cross-correlations to unsupported intermetal-
lic compounds are attempted whenever applicable to highlight
the differences and common features.
2. Formation of Intermetallic Compounds
To highlight the widespread presence of intermetallic com-
pounds, Table 1 gives a compact overview of combinations
known to date of transition metals and oxides, for which, after
a high-temperature treatment in hydrogen, the formation of
intermetallic compounds has been reported. By far the most
data are found for the classical catalytically active noble metal
particles Pt, Rh, and Pd, much less data for Ni, Cu, Ru, and Au.
The examples include only supported nanoparticulate systems,
either as classical impregnated catalysts or thin film model sys-
tems. Notably, regarding the stability of the intermetallic
phases discussed below, the TEM work contains exclusively
ex situ-obtained data. This poses the general stability question
when the formed intermetallic compounds are exposed to air;
changes their structure and cross-correlations to catalytic data
are established. Although in situ or, better still, operando, char-
acterizations are highly desirable, these data are not available
to date. However, most of the intermetallic compounds need
very harsh reoxidation temperatures for decomposition (T
673 K; see section 3.1.3.). An obvious exception concerns inter-
metallic compounds with bi-functional synergism prevalent in
the working state of the catalyst between the support and the
intermetallic compound particles, but even in these cases, the
working state is sometimes preserved upon transfer (e.g.,
ZnPd on ZnO[108]).

2.1. Platinum
For systems including Pt particles, formation of intermetallic
compounds is a fairly common feature, both on easily reduci-
ble and hard-to-reduce oxides. On CeO2, only two distinct in-
termetallic
compounds
are
observed,
CePt3
[13,14]
and
CePt5.[11,20,44,45,89] Whereas the former has only been observed
in thin film systems after reduction in hydrogen at 873 K,[13,14]
the latter has been reported more frequently.[11,20,44,45,89] As
a common feature, CePt5 is only observed at reduction temper-
atures of 1173 K and higher. CePt5 has also been reported for
Tb-doped Pt/CeO2 systems.[89] Ce-Pt compound formation has
been reported at and above 750 K in thin film Pt samples[90]
and has been held responsible for catalyst deactivation upon
reduction in hydrogen between 473 and 773 K.[91] For Pt on
Ga2O3, reduction at 773 K on an impregnated catalyst yields
the intermetallic compounds Ga3Pt5 and Ga5.4Pt10.6.[3,6] The
system Pt/ZnO is a very interesting one, as different intermetal-
lic compounds are observed if different Zn-containing supports
are used. On Pt/ZnO, only the intermetallic compound ZnPt is
encountered, typically after high-temperature reduction be-
tween 473 and 773 K.[3,6,48,49,76,116,117,128,133,137,146] For Pt particles
supported on an Al-Zn spinel, both ZnPt and ZnPt3 have been
observed,[18,92] depending on the reduction/annealing tempera-
ture. ZnPt is found after reduction at 830–850 K in hydrogen,
whereas treatments at lower temperatures or oxidative regen-
eration lead to the formation of the Pt-rich ZnPt3 phase.[18,92]
Use of SiO2 or Al2O3 as a support for metal particles demon-
strated for the first time the strong metal–support interaction
with hard-to-reduce oxides. Reduction at high temperatures
(773–1173 K) led to the formation of the intermetallic com-
pounds
PtSi,
Pt2Si,
cubic
and
monoclinic
Pt3Si,
and
Pt12Si5.[13–15,29,39,40,47] Similar to SiO2, intermetallic compound or
alloy formation with participation of Al2O3 needs very harsh re-
duction conditions at and above 773 K. Al-Pt alloys and the in-
termetallic compound AlPt3 were reported.[13,14,25,31,33,157] Reduc-
tion of Pt/SnO2 and Pt/In2O3 catalysts at 673 and 523 K caused
the formation of the intermetallic compounds SnPt, Sn2Pt,
Sn4Pt, and In2Pt, respectively.[3,6,93,140] On Pt/V2O3 catalysts, the
ordering of the intermetallic compound Pt3V, prepared by re-
duction at 773 K, could be triggered by preoxidation treat-
ments prior to reduction.[94] In addition, by using TiO2 as the
support, electron microscopy revealed the formation of TiPt in-
termetallic compounds after high-temperature reduction[95]
and a TiPt3 phase after reduction at 823 K.[113] TiPt3 has also
been observed by Beard et al. after reduction at 973 K.[114]
Direct Pt-Ti interactions were detected after reduction at 773 K
by Belton et al.[96]
2.2. Rhodium
Compared to oxide-supported Pt and Pd particles, the forma-
tion of intermetallic compounds in Rh-containing systems has
scarcely been investigated. Only for four oxides, that is, CeO2,
SiO2, TiO2, and V2O3, has intermetallic formation after high-tem-
perature reduction been reported. CeRh3 particles were ob-
tained after reduction at 773 K on a Rh/CeO2 thin film cata-
lyst,[49] Rh2Si[26] and Rh3Si particles[21] on powder samples after
reduction at 1223 and 850 K. Extended X-ray absorption fine
structure measurements were used to identify not only direct
Rh-Ti interactions after reduction at 773 K,[97] but also distinct
TiRh3 and TiRh intermetallic compounds at 623 K.[30] By using
V2O3 as the support, Rh3V, RhV3, and Rh5V3 intermetallic com-
pounds have been obtained at temperatures of 673 K and
higher.[54,55,76]
2.3. Palladium
A closer look at the literature reveals that the most data are
available by far for oxide-supported Pd particles.1 † This indi-
cates both the number of different intermetallic compounds
formed and that the system has been scrutinized particularly
from structural, electronic, and catalytic points of view in the
last decade.2 † Pd/ZnO is by far the most experimentally and
theoretically studied system. Intermetallic compound forma-
tion has been observed with participation of easily reducible
transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O3 or V2O5
[94]), refractory oxides
(e.g., SiO2,[24,27,36,37] Al2O3,[57] or GeO2
[12]), or with oxides giving
rise to special catalytic applications (e.g., methanol steam re-
forming
and
selective
hydrogenation
of
acetylene:
Ga2O3,[3–6,50,51,58,59,64,74,75,100,136] ZnO,3 † In2O3,[3–6,107,136] or SnO2;[12]
and the reverse water–gas shift reaction: ZnO[134,135]). More or
less well-ordered Pd3V is obtained after high-temperature re-
duction treatments in hydrogen at and above 773 K.[94] Pd/SiO2
systems are particularly well studied with respect to the
metal–support interaction at high temperatures. Moss et al. ex-
plained the decrease in specific activity for benzene hydroge-
nation for a Pd/SiO2 catalyst upon raising the reduction tem-
perature to 873 K by the formation of an intermetallic com-
pound.[35] A metal–support interaction and Pd2Si intermetallic
compound formation was also reported by Lamber et al.[101]
and Penner et al.[56] after reduction at 873 K. In the former
case, microdiffraction showed an oriented growth of the Pd2Si
compound with respect to the Pd matrix. A variety of different
Pd-silicides (notably, Pd3Si, Pd4Si, and Pd5Si) in strongly reduced
Pd/SiO2 samples, showing different catalytic properties, were
also detected by XRD and TEM analyses.[24,36,37,101] Equally, the
interaction of Pd particles with reduced Al2O3 supports yielded
the intermetallic compounds AlPd and Al3Pd4.[41,57,102] Recent
interest in preparing CO2-selective methanol steam reforming
catalysts resulted in the formation of a number of Pd-based in-
termetallic compounds on “unusual” oxide supports, namely
ZnO, Ga2O3, In2O3, SnO2, and GeO2. Whereas the intermetallic
compound formation, at least at low reduction temperatures
(i.e., 573 K) for ZnO and GeO2, is relatively simple and gives
rise to ZnPd4 † and GePd2,[12] the situation is more complex for

the other oxides. Over Ga2O3, a large variety of different inter-
metallic
compounds
with
compositions
from
GaPd2
and
Ga2Pd5 to GaPd and Ga5Pd have all been reported on thin film
and impregnated Pd/Ga2O3 systems[3–6,50,51,58,59,64,85,100] after re-
duction at and above 523 K. Particularly well-studied is the
supported intermetallic compound GaPd2,[50,51,58,59,64,100] which
can also be prepared by decomposition of hydrotalcite precur-
sors.[74,75] In this regard, the formation of the intermetallic com-
pound has also been studied with respect to structure and cat-
alysis over different polymorphic forms of Ga2O3.[64,100] The in-
termetallic compound InPd was obtained after heating thin
films and impregnated Pd/In2O3 samples at 523 K in hydro-
gen.[3–6,12] In3Pd2 was obtained only on the impregnated
system after reduction at 773 K, followed by In3Pd.[12] In gener-
al, intermetallic formation over Pd/In2O3 is influenced heavily
by the reducibility of single-phase In2O3 to the metallic In
state. For the thin film sample, InPd formation already occurs
upon preparation before the reduction treatment.[12] Reduction
of Pd/SnO2 samples induces formation of an array of Pd-Sn in-
termetallic compounds, including Pd2Sn, PdSn, and Pd3Sn2.[12,41]
As with Pd/Ga2O3, intermetallic compound formation in the im-
pregnated Pd/GeO2 system offers the advantage of convenient
study of the influence of the structure and chemical state of
the oxide support. In fact, GePd2 formation by using Pd parti-
cles on tetragonal GeO2 yielded only GePd2, but those on hex-
agonal GeO2 a mixture of GePd2 and GePd. This was explained
tentatively by reference to the higher solubility of hexagonal
GeO2 in water giving rise to an enhanced metal–support con-
tact area upon catalyst preparation and in turn, more efficient
intermetallic compound formation.[12] The properties of the
prototypical intermetallic compound–oxide system that has
evolved in the last decade, Pd/ZnO (and ZnPd/ZnO after reduc-
tion), should not be discussed in detail at this point, since
comprehensive reviews for almost all aspects of its chemical
and
electronic
structure
and
catalytic
properties
already
exist.[86,98,99,103] However, mixtures of ZnPd, Zn3Pd2, and ZnPd2
have also been obtained by interaction between Pd and ZnO,
depending
on the synthesis conditions.[1,79] The
Pd/CeO2
system has been scrutinized in detail under comparable reduc-
ing conditions, but no signs of a well-defined intermetallic
compound have been observed up to 1180 K (over 20 h), nei-
ther by XRD, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), nor
high-resolution (HR)TEM analyses. A solid solution of Ce in the
Pd structure was proposed instead.[59] Similarly, Ke
˛pin
´ski et al.
discuss a substitutional alloy Ce-Pd exhibiting a face-centered
cubic structure with a slightly larger lattice constant that Pd
metal, formed at 773 K and above. Interestingly, the authors
infer the influence of a suppressed metal–support interface
due to increased crystallite size of both Pd and CeO2 at higher
reduction temperatures.[111,112] A Pd-Cr alloy phase has been
observed after a methanol decomposition reaction by using
XRD.[126]
2.4. Nickel
Information on the metal–support interaction and intermetallic
compound formation in Ni-oxide systems is limited to date to
the Ni-CeO2, Ni-TiO2, and Ni-SiO2 systems. CeNi and CeNi2 were
observed after the hydrogenation of benzene at temperatures
of approximately 500 K.[8] In addition, Ni3Si was observed on
a Ni/SiO2 catalyst after heating in hydrogen at 850 K.[23] Martin
et al. interpreted the decrease in hydrogenation and hydroge-
nolysis activity at 1120 K as a result of the formation of Ni-sili-
cide species.[104] Praliaud and Martin inferred the presence of
a
Ni79Si11
compound
from
magnetic
measurements
at
1180 K.[22] Ni/TiO2 reported by Chettibi et al. represented a com-
plex system: whereas radiation-treated catalysts showed the
presence of Ni2Ti and Ni3Ti phases, in the simple calcined and
hydrogen-reduced sample, a Ni5TiO7 compound was found.
This was attributed to the contribution of the persisting NiO
phase during reduction. A higher cyclohexane selectivity in
benzene hydrogenation for the radiation-treated catalyst re-
sulted in turn.[154]
2.5. Copper
Formation of a Cu0.61Si0.39 intermetallic compound was ob-
served after the decomposition of methanol over a Cu/ZnO
catalyst.[9] A copper silicide with unknown composition was
postulated by Van den Oetelaar after a thermal treatment of
a Cu/SiO2 catalyst under ultra-high vacuum conditions at
873 K.[25]
2.6. Gold
The single formation of an Au-Cu bimetallic phase has been
observed for complex Au/CuO/TiO2 catalysts, which were
formed by activation in air at 573 K and subsequent reduction
in hydrogen at 573 K.[16] A report by Liu et al. demonstrated for
the first time the reactive metal–support interaction in nano-
rod Au/ZnO systems, that is, after reduction at 573 K in hydro-
gen; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray ab-
sorption fine structure measurements indicated the formation
of an Au-Zn alloy phase.[105]
2.7. Ruthenium
Studies on the catalytic combustion of ethyl acetate over Ru/
SnO2 catalysts revealed the formation of a Sn7Ru3 intermetallic
compound after prereduction at 673 K (for 0.5 h) in hydrogen,
as evidenced by XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
HRTEM analyses. Interestingly, the large Sn7Ru3 particles were
present in a characteristic core–shell structure, with a well-crys-
tallized intermetallic compound core and an amorphous Sn-en-
riched shell. The core shell structure was proposed to arise
from a phase separation of the catalyst after contact with
air.[138]

3. Structural and Catalytic Aspects in Selected
Examples
3.1. Structural aspects
3.1.1. Influence of the oxide’s reducibility on the formation of
intermetallic compounds
The discussion on the influence of the oxide’s reducibility on
the formation of intermetallic compounds represents one of
the core topics in reactive and strong metal–support interac-
tions. In the early days, the “strong” metal–support interaction
was solely assigned to easily reducible transition metal oxides,
such as TiO2 or CeO2, capable of forming sub-stoichiometric
oxide species.[159] Hard-to-reduce oxides, such as (as extreme
cases) SiO2 or Al2O3, were excluded from entering a state of
strong metal–support interaction. Recent studies, however,
showed that this mutual discrimination is no longer valid. Even
SiO2 or Al2O3, albeit at higher reduction temperatures, were
found to enter the state of reactive metal–support interaction.
Here, these comparably harsh reduction treatments did not
lead to a collapse of the original structures of metal nor sup-
port. Furthermore, the metal species was sometimes needed
for epitaxial growth of the intermetallic compound (for details,
see section 3.1.2.). TEM analysis of thin film Pt/SiO2 and Pt/
Al2O3 samples after entering the intermetallic compound state
directly revealed the structural stability of especially the sup-
port.[13,14] Combinations for which this concept has been ex-
plicitly
proven
include
Pt
and
Pd,
on
both
SiO2
and
Al2O3.[13–15,24,27,29,35–37,39,40,56,158] Although this of course already
implies that the reducibility of the corresponding oxides does
have an influence on the formation of intermetallic com-
pounds, a more catchy example includes Pd particles on In2O3
(Figure 3).[12] Driven by the abilities of the intermetallic com-
pound InPd to selectively catalyze the methanol steam reform-
ing reaction towards CO2, the formation of InPd is heavily influ-
enced on the one hand by the reduction behavior of In2O3 and
on the other hand by the special preparation pathway. In due
course, Pd particles conventionally prepared by incipient wet-
ness impregnation on In2O3 (TEM image, Figure 3A) enter
a state of reactive metal–support interaction at approximately
573 K and InPd is thereby formed (TEM image, Figure 3B; the
corresponding XRD diffraction patterns are highlighted in
part C). InPd is subsequently transformed into In3Pd2 at higher
reduction temperatures. In contrast, if InPd is formed via a thin
film model system, prepared by growing epitaxial Pd particles
on NaCl(001) and subsequent embedding in a nm-thick film
of In2O3 at 573 K (TEM image, Figure 3D), compound formation
already occurs during the preparation process (SAED pattern,
Figure 3E). The reason for this rather peculiar feature is the
outspokenly
well-pronounced
reducibility
of
single-phase
In2O3, whereby In metal species are formed even at 573 K in
hydrogen (Figure 3F).[107] Together with the extended metal–
oxide interface prevalent for these thin film systems, this leads
to the effective loss of reactive oxygen, In metal species, and
InPd formation even in the only slightly reducing conditions of
a high vacuum in the absence of hydrogen.[94,107]
3.1.2. Stabilization of unusual particle morphologies and
crystallographic aspects
The discussion of both topics goes well beyond the simple for-
mation of the intermetallic compound itself. Although report-
ed for a number of systems, triggering special particle mor-
phologies and directed exploitation of crystallographic rela-
tions in the formation of intermetallic formation through the
reactive metal–support interaction usually requires special
model systems. Special particle morphologies have been re-
ported for CePt5 (starting from a 4 wt% Pt/CeO2 powder cata-
lyst),[44,89] Pt3V,[94] Pd3V,[94] Pt3Si,[15] Pt3Al,[13,14] and CePt3
[13,14]
(starting from Pt/V2O3, Pd/V2O3, Pt/SiO2, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt/CeO2
thin film catalysts). As a representative example, Figure 4
shows two well-facetted CePt5 particles in the [010] zone axis
obtained by Bernal et al. starting from a 4% Pt/CeO2 catalyst,
subsequently reduced in hydrogen at 1173 K. The intermetallic
particles both show (100) and (001) lattice fringes and are at-
tached to two larger CeO2 grains. The presence of CePt5 has
also been confirmed by image simulation. The importance of

the metal–oxide interface is further highlighted by the HRTEM
image shown in Figure 5. Epitaxy of (100) CePt5//(002) CeO2
and (001) CePt5//(002)CeO2 has been observed in the image
and, thus, in the corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern.
This is due to the high degree of structural match of the cubic
CeO2 and hexagonal CePt5 structures.[44]
Special growth orientations have also been reported to ac-
count for the formation of well-oriented CePt3 particles starting
from Pt/CeO2 thin film catalysts (Figure 6). Due to the epitaxial
growth of Pt on NaCl(001) and the subsequent embedding in
the CeO2 matrix (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in
parts A and C, respectively), a large metal–oxide interface is
created. In consequence, well-facetted and reconstructed CePt3
particles are formed at comparatively low temperatures of
773 K (TEM image and SAED pattern shown in parts B and D,
respectively). CeO2 itself appears in the SAED pattern as a set
of ring reflections; Pt exhibits discrete spots due to its crystal-
lite size and epitaxial growth on NaCl(001). Notably, Pt and
CePt3 are well-oriented with respect to each other, a conse-
quence of the close match of the face-centered cubic Pt and
simple cubic CePt3 structures (lattice parameter mismatch
8%[13,14]). Hence, the Pt(200) and CePt3(100) spots are found
in the same azimuthal orientation in the SAED patterns.
Special crystallographic relations between metal, oxide sup-
port, and intermetallic compound may give rise to a much
larger
number
of
well-oriented
intermetallic
compounds.
These have been obtained in all of the above including
ZnPd,[3–6,12,52,56,60–63,86,87,98,99]
Ga5Pd2,[58,59]
Ni3Si,[23]
Pd2Si,[101]
ZnPt,[18] and Pt3Si.[47] The explanation for both phenomena
must include the complex interaction of the reducing agent
(hydrogen) with the metal surface at higher temperatures, as
well as topotactic growth or melting and recrystallization. Re-
garding the former, and most obvious also for the particles
shown in Figure 6 and MPt3 (M=Ce, Al, Si) intermetallic com-
pound particles in general, it is clear that the first step of inter-
metallic compound formation must involve the dissociative ad-
sorption of hydrogen on the Pt surface. In due course, as has
been known for a long time, particle shapes may be altered by
exposure to a specific gas atmosphere at elevated tempera-
tures. In that respect, a transformation of drop-like Pt particles
into particles with cubic morphology has been reported both
by Wang et al.[164] and by Shi and Masel et al.[166,167] upon expo-
sure to hydrogen at 900 K. However, regardless of the high im-
portance of the subsequent intermetallic compound formation
and the stabilization of unusual particle morphologies, the au-
thors give different explanations. Wang et al. ascribe the be-
havior to the initial presence of impurities (e.g., carbon or
oxygen), which are subsequently removed upon treatment in
hydrogen but stay intact if other gases are used (e.g., nitro-

gen).[164] This implies that the cubic outlines represent the
equilibrium crystal shape of the clean Pt particles, whereas the
rounded ones are associated with those of the adsorbate-cov-
ered Pt particles. In contrast, Shi and Masel et al. argue that
the adsorption of hydrogen on different crystal facets might
specifically lower the surface free energy of certain facets. As
a result, those facets might grow in the presence of an
adgas.[166,167] This has also been focused on by McCabe and
Schmidt, who conclude that the activation energy of hydrogen
adsorption varies significantly with the crystal facet.[168] In that
respect, Pt(110) facets bind hydrogen more strongly, followed
by Pt(210) and Pt(211). In contrast, Pt(110) and Pt(111) bind
hydrogen most weakly. Accordingly, the Pt(110) surface should
fill up with hydrogen first and is stabilized and grows in the
presence of hydrogen, whereas the Pt(111) facets are expected
to shrink. Similar shape transformations for Pt particles have
also
been
observed
in
hydrogen
sulfide-containing
mix-
tures.[169,170] Notably, however, some authors did not observe
these shape transformations upon treatment in hydrogen or
hydrogen-containing mixtures.[171–178] At least it can be expect-
ed that some crystallographic relation between Pt and the sub-
strate may be responsible for the peculiar cubic morphology
of the intermetallic compounds observed, because the trans-
formation into cubes has almost always been observed on
planar thin-film model catalysts. Similar arguments also hold
for the corresponding AlPt3 and CePt3 systems.[13,14] As dis-
cussed in the preceding section on the reaction mechanism,
the next steps in the intermetallic compound formation pro-
cess are the penetration of the metal surface by atomic hydro-
gen and the reduction of SiO2 (or any other oxide) followed by
the migration of the Si atoms into the Pt particles and a topo-
tactic growth of Pt3Si at the interface of the Pt particles. This
crystallographic match can be derived from HRTEM images
and electron diffraction patterns, showing cubic Pt3Si with the
Cu3Au-type crystal structure (Figure 7A) and slightly distorted
monoclinic Pt3Si (Figure 7B) on their simplest zone axes, that
is, the [100] zone axis for Pt and cubic Pt3Si and the [100],
[010], or [001] zone axes for monoclinic Pt3Si. The correspond-
ing electron diffraction patterns show spots of cubic Pt3Si in
the same azimuthal orientation as those of Pt.[15] A HRTEM
image of an irregular Pt12Si5 particle without pronounced crys-
tallographic relation to the former Pt lattice is shown in Fig-
ure 7C. Notably, intermetallic compound formation in the Pt-
SiO2 system has been revealed by dark-field imaging to include
a flattening of particles owing to an increased degree of
metal–support interaction.[15] Similar observation have also
been made by Lamber et al. during the formation of the inter-
metallic compounds Pt3Si and Pt2Si.[39]
A corresponding well-facetted ZnPt particle, obtained by re-
duction of Pt particles on a ZnAl2O4 spinel matrix at 773 K is
shown in Figure 8. The 3-fold outline of the particle can be
seen clearly.[18] This is a clear indication that also on complex
oxide systems metal–support interaction effects may stabilize
well-outlined intermetallic particle morphologies.
An instructive example encompassing both particle mor-
phologies and crystallographic aspects are Pt3V and Pd3V inter-
metallic compounds, which are both formed after treatment in
hydrogen at 673–773 K, starting from the corresponding Pt/
V2O3 and Pd/V2O3 systems. Due to the epitaxial ordering be-
tween the Pt/Pd structures and the V2O3 support, well-ordered
and cube-like particles of tetragonal Pt3V and Pd3V are ob-
tained (Figure 9A and B, respectively). In contrast, if the epi-
taxy between Pt/Pd and V2O3 is lifted by a simple oxidation
procedure (at 673 K, transforming the catalysts into Pt/V2O5
and Pd/V2O5) before the actual reduction steps, the same Pt3V
and Pd3V intermetallic compounds are obtained but without
ordering or distinct cube morphology (Figure 9C).[94] This is
a clear indication that the crystallographic match between the
metal particles and the forming intermetallic compound steers
the morphology that is subsequently formed and stabilized.
Notably, the morphology and crystallographic match can ex-
plain the formation of a number of especially well-ordered in-
termetallic compounds, but not those of typically higher non-
noble metal content. This has been discussed in detail for the

formation of Pt12Si5 (starting from Pt/SiO2),[15,40] Pd3Si (starting
from Pd/SiO2),[24] V3Rh and VRh (both starting from Rh/
V2O3),[54,55] GaPd (starting from Pd/Ga2O3),[58] GePd (starting
from Pd/GeO2),[12] Pd3Sn2 (starting from Pd/SnO2),[12] and In3Pd2/
In3Pd (starting from Pd/In2O3).[12] The formation of all these
noble-metal-poorer intermetallic compounds is sometimes be-
lieved to proceed via the correspondingly noble-metal-richer
intermetallic compounds by diffusion and stepwise incorpora-
tion of the other non-noble metal atom into the noble metal
phase. This has been discussed explicitly for Pt12Si5 (proceeding
via the initial cubic Pt3Si phase).[15] A similar mechanism has
been suggested by Juszczyk and Karpinski to explain the pres-
ence of Pd-depleted phases in the Pd/SiO2 system.[24] In partic-
ular, the stepwise formation of the Pd-depleted Pd3Si com-
pound should proceed via the Pd-richer Pd4Si compound and
was stated to involve the incorporation of Si into the interme-
tallic compound.[24] However, as for example the Pt-depleted
phases do not show any crystallographic relationship with Pt
or the Pt3Si compound, the exact mechanism remains unclear.
For the corresponding V-richer intermetallic compounds, the
penetration of metallic V from the Rh–VOx interface into the
Rh bulk was found to depend on both the concentration gra-
dient and the reduction temperature. One therefore might an-
ticipate a V-richer shell around the particle perimeter at lower
reduction temperature, whereas at higher temperatures the V
concentration gradient to the particle core is levelled gradually
and V-richer intermetallic compounds are formed but not pri-
marily influenced by crystallographic orientations.[54,55]
However, even coalescence of neighboring particles, over-
lapping of different phases, and melting and recrystallization
phenomena must be taken into account to fully appreciate the
pathway of intermetallic compound formation and the result-
ing morphology. This scenario is clearly visible in the high-tem-
perature reduction of Pt/SiO2. Curved edges, grain boundaries,
truncated corners and other features of high atom diffusivity
are all present on and in the particles and accordingly visible
in the corresponding HRTEM images. This also includes flatten-
ing of the particles upon silicide formation.[15]
3.1.3. Reversibility of intermetallic compound formation
The potential decomposition and (full) structural reversal of in-
termetallic compound formation represents one of the core
topics in not only the full understanding of the structural and
catalytic action of intermetallic compounds but also in the
judgment of the metal–support interaction itself.[89,159] As al-
ready outlined in the Introduction, full structural reversal to
the state prior to entering the intermetallic state is a prerequi-
site for an interaction to be classified as “strong” metal–sup-
port interaction.[159] Nevertheless, the general inability of an in-
termetallic system, formed after reduction in hydrogen, to
return to this initial state, has ultimately led to the introduction
of the new term “reactive” metal–support interaction.[1] Usually,
the decomposition of the intermetallic compound is achieved
through high-temperature oxidation in either oxygen or air.
This oxidation treatment, however, does not typically reverse
morphological and structural changes, and metal particle redis-
persion after sintering is only partially restored.
There are only a few cases in literature in which these issues
are discussed in detail, directly via monitoring by structure-de-
termining methods or indirectly via changes in the catalytic
profiles. Juszczyk et al. investigated the transformation from
Pd2Si to Pd metal and SiO2 after a high-temperature oxidation
treatment and revealed a final state of partial coverage of the
metal by SiO2 species.[24] This was proven on the basis of cata-
lytic measurements in n-pentane isomerization,[24] depicted
schematically in Figure 10. This shows the complex interplay of
metal, intermetallic compound, and support under different re-
duction and oxidation treatments and gives hints towards
a partial coverage of the metal particles by reoxidized SiO2.[24]
However, no direct structural proof has been provided. Similar
observations have been made by Hippe et al. for the oxidative
decomposition of Pt3Si/Pt12Si5 mixtures,[40] who concluded the
partial decoration of the metal particles by SiO2 to account for
the insufficient CO chemisorption capability upon reoxidation
(Figure 11, spectrum E). Pakhomov et al. reported the transfor-
mation of d-ZnPt to ZnPt3, the initial supporting spinel and
ZnO after a treatment in air at 823 K for 30 min.[92] Zawadzki
et al. reported decomposition of the ZnPt compound upon
treatment in air at 1073 K,[18] as did Ren-Yuan et al. for Al-Pt
alloys.[17] Sadi et al. reported that very high temperatures are
necessary to invert Rh2Si intermetallic compound formation by
titration with water.[26] Similar arguments were also stressed by
Bernal et al. for the stability of CePt5 compound particles. Even
after reoxidation at 773 K, no decomposition was observed.[45]
A Pd/Ga2O3 catalyst showed the same behavior, although in
this special case, the formation of the covering oxide layer
after reoxidation seemed to be dependent on the initial
degree of intermetallic compound formation. Thus, a catalyst

at 673 K, whereas deeper reduction at 673 K caused the forma-
tion of a core–shell particle with a metallic Pd core and an
amorphous Ga2O3 shell after reoxidation at 673 K.[58] A similar
shell of In2O3 around a Pd metal particle has been observed
upon oxidative decomposition of InPd.[12] In contrast, there are
also some reports that the decomposition of the intermetallic
compound does not lead to encapsulated metal particles, but
rather to a mixture of metal particles and oxide. This has been
proven directly by electron microscopy for the decomposition
of Pt3V, Pd3V, and Rh-V intermetallic compounds,[54,94] and for
the latter additionally by changes in the selectivity patterns in
CO hydrogenation.[55]
3.1.4. Single- and multiphase intermetallic compound
formation
The discussion in this section is very much connected to the
preceding section about the reaction mechanism and the sta-
bilization of unusual particle morphologies or the influence of
crystallographic aspects. It is nevertheless of high importance,
especially regarding the potential technological or catalytic ap-
plications. Regarding the latter, for both fundamental scientific
and more application-oriented uses, preparation and/or forma-
tion of single-phase intermetallic compounds would be highly
desirable. Generally, the preparation pathway to intermetallic
compounds through the reactive metal–support interaction is
not a very directed one and very often mixtures of several in-
termetallic compounds occur; this is due to a delicate interplay
between thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic com-
pound and the diffusion kinetics, which strongly depend upon
the particle size. This is especially true if the compound is
formed during the catalytic reaction. Some degree of steering
can be achieved through crystallographic relationships, as dis-
cussed earlier, but this usually applies only to a minor number
of intermetallic compounds. As the occurrence of such com-
pounds is a frequent phenomenon in catalytic science, getting
some ideas on how to judge whether single- or multiphase in-
termetallic compounds can be expected would be desirable.
The corresponding phase diagrams are a valuable starting
point, with a subsequent search for phases with high melting
points, indicating highly stable intermetallic compounds. An
archetypical example is the Pd-Zn phase diagram (but other
valid examples are the phase diagrams of Pd-Si and Ge-Pd,
strongly dominated by Pd2Si and GePd2, respectively[179]),
which exhibits one very pronounced intermetallic compound,
namely ZnPd with tetragonal structure.[99] By additionally ex-
ploiting the crystallographic match between the face-centered
cubic Pd and the tetragonal ZnPd structure, which is better
than 92%, it is not only possible to prepare single-phase ZnPd
particles but also to structurally stabilize the particles over
a wide temperature region of up to 873 K.[56] This, however, is
a rare example. It is more common by far that, due to the dif-
fusion kinetics, mixtures of different intermetallic compounds
are present. In addition, the kinds of phases present and the
ratios between them are not only strongly time dependent
(diffusion kinetics) but also depend on the applied tempera-
ture (thermodynamic stability). At best, distinct temperature re-
gions exist, in which a single intermetallic compound prevails
before it is transformed further. Focusing in detail on the indi-
vidual intermetallic compounds that are reported in the litera-
ture to be formed upon the reactive metal–support interac-
tion, experimental procedures exist for the majority of systems,
which indeed allow stabilization of the compound within
a well-defined temperature region. This is true for Rh3Si,[21]

Summarizing the literature, the conclusion can be drawn
that the higher the amount of the corresponding main group
metal in the intermetallic compound, the higher the necessary
reduction temperature.
3.1.5. Influence of preparation artefacts on the formation of
intermetallic compounds
A particularly important topic, which is also connected to the
general assignment of intermetallic compound formation to
a true reactive metal–support interaction, is related to some-
times misleading preparation artefacts of supported metal cat-
alysts. These artefacts are usually connected with an at least
partial dissolution of the oxide support in the aqueous precur-
sor solution upon catalyst impregnation.[180] Thus, an extended
metal–oxide interface is created artificially, which may give rise
to peculiar behavior upon heating in hydrogen at elevated
temperatures. This effect is best highlighted in two examples,
which present respectively the pre-intermetallic compound
state and the different extent of intermetallic compound for-
mation, if separate oxide modifications with varying solubility
in water are used. Bernal et al. report on the peculiar behavior
of La2O3-supported Rh particles, which show encapsulation ef-
fects (i.e., reduced La2xO3y species decorating the Rh parti-
cles) at surprisingly low reduction temperatures (473–573 K),
given the hard reducibility of La2O3. As an explanation, which
is supported by HRTEM imaging, partial dissolution of La2O3 in
the aqueous Rh(NO3)3 solution is offered. In due course, the Rh
particles are covered by oxidic La species, which, upon reduc-
tion, are converted to LaRhO3 perovskite and La2O2(CO3) spe-
cies (Figure 12).[89] Due to the intimate contact, this facilitates
subsequent formation of La-Rh intermetallic compounds.
Although not always directly correlated with intermetallic
compound formation, these preparation artefacts have been
directly linked to peculiar intermetallic compound formation of
Pd/GeO2 catalysts. For the latter, Pd particles have been im-
pregnated on the tetragonal and hexagonal modifications of
GeO2. The former is insoluble in water, but the latter slightly
soluble. This different chemical behavior causes formation of
GePd2 on Pd/GeO2 (tetragonal) at 673 K and GePd at 723 K
(Figure 13A). In contrast, GePd2 formation already starts at
473 K and GePd at 573 K, if Pd particles are supported on hex-
agonal GeO2 (Figure 13B).[12] The shift in onset temperature to
lower temperatures in the latter case reflects precisely the
more intimate contact between Pd and GeO2, which is estab-
lished by partial dissolution of hexagonal GeO2 during catalyst
preparation. In summary, these two examples highlight the im-
portance of the extent of metal–oxide contact area for efficient
intermetallic compound formation, also in view of the reaction
mechanism discussed in the preceding section.
3.1.6. Particle size effects during the preparation of inter-
metallic compounds through the reactive metal–support inter-
action
The kinetically motivated discussion about possible particle
size effects during the preparation of oxide-supported interme-
tallic compounds is very much connected to the general im-

portance and influence of the (inter)metallic–oxide
interface on catalytic behavior and the formation of
the intermetallic compounds in general. However, de-
tailed studies on the particle size effects are very lim-
ited and only available for a few selected systems.
Lamber and Romanowski linked the dispersion of Pt
particles on SiO2 upon oxidation and reduction di-
rectly to an enhanced strong metal–support interac-
tion.[39] Lamber et al. found that the extent of Ni-Si in-
termetallic compound formation can be correlated
directly to the Ni particle size in accordance with the
increase in time needed for compound formation
due to the longer diffusion paths. In due course,
smaller Ni crystallites (<5 nm) were exclusively found
to be fully converted to Ni3Si, but larger ones (>
10 nm) only partially, that is, they contained both Ni
metal and Ni3Si.[23] Similar observations have been
also made by Karim et al. in the Zn-Pd system.[52] In
this case, the particle size was also directly correlated
to the CO2 selectivity in methanol steam reforming.
High-temperature treatment led to complete trans-
formation of Pd into ZnPd but the CO2 selectivity did
not increase monotonically with the extent of inter-
metallic compound formation. Both fully transformed
particles and mixed particles showed the same CO2
selectivity.
However,
smaller
particles
generally
showed a lower CO2 selectivity. It was hence conclud-
ed that an increase in ZnPd particle size had no detri-
mental impact on the catalyst reactivity.[52,118,147] A
very similar particle size effect for ZnPd particles has
been observed in the reverse water–gas shift reac-
tion: the results indicated that the turnover frequen-
cy increased as the ZnPd crystallite size decreased.[134]
Also in the Pd-Ga2O3 system, a particle size effect was
observed.
Thus,
higher
reduction
temperatures
caused the formation of larger Ga2Pd5 particles and
a generally deeper reduction of former Pd particles.
However, the extent of intermetallic compound for-
mation was not linked directly to CO2 selectivity in
methanol steam reforming.[58]
3.2. Catalytic aspects
3.2.1. Overview of catalytic aspects
An overview of the intermetallic compounds that are encoun-
tered upon reactive metal–support interaction and the respec-
tive catalytic reactions is given in Table 2. The vast majority of
intermetallic compounds are thus observed upon reductive
pretreatments and only a few during the catalytic reaction
itself.[7–11] Regarding the former, the view on the use of inter-
metallic
compounds
for
specific
catalytic
reactions
has
changed over the last few years in favor of the directed prepa-
ration of specific intermetallic compounds.[1] A well-known ex-
ample in this respect is the group of Pd-based intermetallic
compounds, which have been found to selectively catalyze the
methanol steam reforming reaction towards CO2
[3–6] or the hy-
drogenation of acetylene.[181] This directed approach has been
fuelled by better understanding of their structural, bonding,
and electronic properties in the last decade.[1]
With respect to that presented in Table 2, the formation of
intermetallic compounds through the reactive metal–support
interaction is reported to have both a beneficial or detrimental
effect, whereas upon deliberate preparation by prereduction,
the vast majority of samples show beneficial effects. This has
been reported especially for the selective dehydrogenation of
methanol to methyl formate over ZnPd (Figure 14A),[4] the in-
crease of the isomerization selectivity (n-pentane[24] and n-hep-
tane[17,102]) over Pd3Si and AlPt catalysts, and the increase in
methanation activity upon formation of ZnPt.[83] Exemplarily,
the n-heptane isomerization selectivity is drastically increased
on AlPt from approximately 0% before entering the interme-
tallic state to almost 20% after reduction at 873 K, as shown in
Figure 15. ZnPt has also been shown in detail to be a promising
catalyst for selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to
crotyl alcohol.[48,49,182] Rh-V intermetallic compounds (especially

V3Rh5) have been shown to increase methane selectivity in CO
hydrogenation.[54,55] Nevertheless, most of the data nowadays
is available for a series of Pd-based intermetallic compounds,
the presence of which has been shown to steer the selectivity
of methanol steam reforming towards CO2 (Figure 14).5 † Nota-
bly, a series of comprehensive review articles especially for the
archetypical ZnPd exist that highlight almost every structural
and catalytic aspect in detail.[2,86,98,99,103]
Detrimental effects upon intermetallic compound formation
have only been reported for benzene dehydrogenation over
thus far compositionally unspecified PdSi phases (decrease in
specific activity)[35] and n-heptane conversion over ZnPt3 and
ZnPt supported on Al-Zn spinels (catalyst deactivation).[18]
However, although the experimental catalytic results are
very clear in most cases, explanations for the behavior are not
usually given or based on speculation. This owes generally to
the high structural and morphological complexity of the ob-
tained systems, which very often hamper a clear addressing of
the catalytic active site. This is even true for the most scruti-
nized Pd-based intermetallic systems in methanol steam re-
forming. Although the general presence of the intermetallic
compounds for selective steam reforming of methanol are
a widely accepted fact, the structural details of the catalytically
active site are by far less clear and most probably involve inter-
action of the intermetallic compound with its (reduced) oxidic
support.[108,109]
3.2.2. Influence of the supporting oxide and the intermetallic
compound–oxide interface
For a full understanding of the catalytic properties, the materi-
al has to be considered holistically. Although clear from a mate-
rials point of view, the fact that the resulting intermetallic com-
pound is supported on a more-or-less reduced oxidic phase
has been less present in the focus of discussion for most of
the catalytic materials containing intermetallic compounds. Re-
visiting Pd-based systems, Coq et al. discussed the presence of
a not-fully reduced Pd promoter in active mixed site ensem-
bles of various catalytic reactions. This species is referred to as
Pd-Md+ and may lead to synergistic effects, for example, in the
liquid-phase hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes by
activation of the C=O bond.[183] Even in this case, it has to be
emphasized that the thus created mixed sites are closely relat-
ed to those typically encountered upon the reactive metal–
support interaction and the associated presence of adlineation,
that is, metal–oxide phase boundary, effects. Without revisiting
the structural prerequisites and effects of the metal–support
interaction, it is clear that the picture of the active mixed-site
ensemble infers that the potentially active mixed site, for ex-
ample, in the case of Pd/SiO2, is composed of structural ensem-
bles of Pd-(SiOx)d+-type compounds, if just the formation of
migrated reduced oxide species is considered. Likewise, the
presence of intermetallic compounds in contact with a reduced
oxide species gives rise to mixed sites, best characterized as

Pd2Si-(SiOx)d+ or, with increasing complexity, Pd/Pd2Si-(SiOx)d+.
As a consequence, not only the metal–metal or metal–support
interface but also the intermetallic compound–oxide support
interface is extremely variable and the intermetallic com-
pound–oxide interaction can no longer be neglected and,
hence, must be considered for a full catalytic understanding of
the catalytic ensemble. Taking this idea even further, this im-
plies necessarily that not only the intermetallic but also the
oxide itself may be structurally, morphologically, or catalytically
altered. Typical manifestations include creation of surface and/
or bulk defects and partial surface reduction including chemi-
cal or compositional changes. Summarizing, the actual catalyti-
cally active and selective state of such entities appears to be
a composition of different potentially active sites, which goes
far beyond the simple picture of an isolated intermetallic com-
pound. Such a state would include necessarily intermetallic
compounds, the intermetallic compound–oxide interface, and
a more-or-less reduced state of the oxide itself.
Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of the systems,
for which structural and catalytic functions of intermetallic
compounds formed through the reactive metal–support inter-
action are discussed cooperatively, the role of the oxide is
largely neglected and the catalytic properties are discussed
almost solely on the basis of the pure intermetallic compound.
This is surprising given that the metal–support interface has
long been suspected to be important for catalytic activity. No-
tably, the mutual discrimination between a facilitated ex-
change of reactants at the interface and newly created interfa-
cial sites is not important to highlight the general importance
of the intermetallic compound–oxide interface. For the Pd/SiO2
system, Juszczyk et al. indicate the potential importance of this
interface in n-pentane isomerization[24] but again it is the Pd-
based intermetallic compound system for which this influence
of the interface is best appreciated and the transformation of
the historical understanding of this class of catalyst systems
from a simple to a very complex one, including the establish-
ment of an intermetallic compound–oxide bifunctional syner-
gism, can best be seen. In this respect, Iwasa et al., in the
course of discovering the peculiar properties of the PdZn,
GaPd, InPd, PtZn, GaPt, and InPt intermetallic com-
pounds in methanol steam reforming, argued specifically in
favor of the intermetallic surface-adsorbed formyl species that
subsequently selectively decomposes to CO2.[3] This led to the
electronic
picture
resembling
the
electronic
structure
of
copper (in the industrially used Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst) by the
strongly altered electronic structure of ZnPd compared to the
constituent metals.[184] This match of electronic structure has in
due course been verified by a number of experimental meth-
ods, including in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.[185,186]
However, whereas the presence of the corresponding interme-
tallic compound is a prerequisite for CO2-selective steam re-
forming, a number of studies showed that water activation,
which is of crucial importance for high CO2 selectivity, cannot
proceed efficiently on the intermetallic surface and thus must
involve the oxide support in some way.[109,110,185,187] Especially
for the Pd/ZnO and Pd/Ga2O3 systems, this has been verified
by structural, spectroscopic, and catalytic methods.[108–110,188]
For the outstanding Pd/ZnO system, evidence has been col-
lected by aberration-corrected electron microscopy that the
simple ZnPd intermetallic compound supported on ZnO is not
CO2-selective, rather the reaction-induced state of an extended
ZnPd-ZnO interface, formed by ZnO surface segregation from
the ZnPd particles and subsequent oxidation (Figure 16).[108]
Similar observations have also been made on a number of un-
supported ZnPd samples.[110,185]
4. Summary and Outlook
Reviewing the published studies involving the formation of in-
termetallic compounds through reactive metal–support inter-
actions and the impact on the catalytic properties leads to the
following conclusions. First of all, the reactive metal–support
interaction occurs in a large number of catalytically interesting
and relevant systems. The reactive metal–support interaction is
very specific for each system, that is, the temperature upon
which intermetallic compounds or alloys are formed during re-
duction depends not only on the combination of noble metal
and supporting oxide but also upon the size of the supported
noble metals, the oxide modification, and the pretreatment of
the supporting oxide. In addition, the delicate interplay be-
tween thermodynamic stability of the compounds and diffu-
sion kinetics of the second component further complicates the
resulting phase composition after reduction. Taking the large
amount of available data into account, the phenomenological
effects of the reactive metal–support interaction are well de-
fined. This applies to both structural and catalytic effects. Re-
garding the latter, the unintended reactive metal–support in-
teraction usually has a largely detrimental effect on the catalyt-
ic activity and the selectivity towards thermodynamically less
stable products increases. For potential beneficial effects, a sys-
tematic approach of exploring noble metal and oxide combi-
nations with focus on the aforementioned parameters is
needed. This, however, has not yet been attempted. The out-
come of such studies would be the possibility for optimized
(i.e., single-phase and with as small intermetallic particles as
possible) syntheses to explore the full beneficial potential of
intermetallic compounds in catalysis.
To finally revisit the definition of a “strong” metal–support
interaction, it is likely that all reports of intermetallic com-

Formation of Intermetallic
Compounds by Reactive Metal–
Support Interaction: A Frequently
Encountered Phenomenon in Catalysis
Strong and stronger: The origin and
manifestation of the reactive metal–sup-
port interaction (RMSI) as a new type of
metal–support interaction are highlight-
ed in selected examples and the struc-
tural and catalytic consequences dis-
cussed. This new term more accurately
describes the most extreme form of
metal–support interaction, that is, inter-
metallic compound formation following
high-temperature reduction of oxide-
supported metal catalysts.
