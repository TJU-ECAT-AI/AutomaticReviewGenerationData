Directing reaction pathways by catalyst active-site
selection using self-assembled monolayers
Simon H. Pang1,*, Carolyn A. Schoenbaum1,*, Daniel K. Schwartz1 & J. Will Medlin1
One key route for controlling reaction selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis is to prepare
catalysts that exhibit only speciﬁc types of sites required for desired product formation. Here
we show that alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers with varying surface densities can be
used to tune selectivity to desired hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation products during
the reaction of furfural on supported palladium catalysts. Vibrational spectroscopic studies
demonstrate that the selectivity improvement is achieved by controlling the availability of
speciﬁc sites for the hydrogenation of furfural on supported palladium catalysts through the
selection of an appropriate alkanethiolate. Increasing self-assembled monolayer density by
controlling the steric bulk of the organic tail ligand restricts adsorption on terrace sites and
dramatically increases selectivity to desired products furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran. This
technique of active-site selection simultaneously serves both to enhance selectivity and
provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

F
urfurals are important platform chemicals produced from
biomass feedstocks by dehydration of simple sugars1,2 and
serve as important model compounds for multifunctional
molecules. These highly reactive molecules represent a classic
example of the challenge of selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis,
as they interact with catalytic surfaces through all of their
functional groups, resulting in a diverse range of products. In
particular,
on
noble
metal
catalysts
under
hydrogenation
conditions, the aromatic furan ring has a tendency to adsorb
strongly on the surface, resulting in decarbonylation (DC)
and
ring
hydrogenation
(RH)
to
produce
furan
and
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the dominant reaction products.
Conversely, reaction steps such as aldehyde hydrogenation
(AH) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) necessary for conversion
of furfuryl oxygenates to desirable fuels (furfuryl alcohol and
methylfuran) do not occur as readily.3–8 Figure 1 depicts the
major reaction pathways for furfural hydrogenation.
A number of techniques have been used to control reaction
selectivity by the use of surface modiﬁers. Carbon monoxide is
well known as a surface poison that can reduce surface ensemble
size to control selectivity9,10 but must continuously be added to
the system at reaction temperatures, and the coverage/packing
cannot
be
readily
controlled.
Organic
modiﬁers
such
as
thiophene11
have
been
added
to
enhance
selectivity,
but
creating a consistent surface remains a challenge because of
inconsistencies arising from different preparation techniques.
Even in studies where the same modiﬁer and preparation
techniques
were
used,
dramatic
differences
have
been
reported12 presumably because of subtle differences in the ﬁnal
modiﬁer state. Although these approaches may improve catalytic
performance in speciﬁc cases, it is important to develop a
technique to systematically and reproducibly control the catalyst
near-surface environment.
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have recently been utilized
as modiﬁers to control reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis13–18.
SAMs are attractive modiﬁers because they form ordered
overlayers, and their chemistry (and thus their effect on surface
reactivity) can be tuned by changing the molecular structure of
the organic ‘tail’ function. For example, altering the surface
density of alkanethiolate SAM modiﬁers by altering the steric
bulk of the tail function has been shown to dramatically affect
reactivity for several reactants by controlling the availability of
different active sites on supported Pd/Al2O3 catalysts19. However,
the manipulation of SAM sterics for controlling reaction
selectivity has not previously been demonstrated.
Here we report the ability of controlled modiﬁer density to
direct furfural hydrogenation along a desired reaction pathway
using SAMs formed from octadecanethiol (C18), which forms
a dense (O3  O3)R30 adsorption geometry with a nearest
neighbour distance of B4.7 Å on Pd fcc(111) surfaces20, or
1-adamantanethiol (AT), which forms a sparse (7  7) unit cell
structure21 with a nearest neighbour distance of B6.4 Å, to coat
supported
Pd/Al2O3
catalysts.
Measurements
of
furfural
hydrogenation kinetics were performed in conjunction with
infrared spectroscopy to provide insight into the principles of
active-site selection for the production of the valuable products
methylfuran and furfuryl alcohol, as opposed to the less desirable
furan and THF.
Results
Catalytic reactions. Gas-phase hydrogenation of furfural was
conducted over 5 and 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in a tubular
packed bed ﬂow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the average
size of the supported Pd particles, 6 and 3 nm (Supplementary
Figs S1 and S2), for the 5 and 1 wt% catalysts, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 2, using uncoated Pd catalysts, the dominant
product was furan, and the rate of DC was about two orders of
magnitude higher than that of aldehyde hydrogenation (AH) and
HDO. Accordingly, the selectivity towards the desirable products,
furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran, was negligible using the
uncoated Pd catalyst. When the catalysts were modiﬁed with
the sparsely packed AT SAM, there was a minor enhancement in
selectivity towards the desired products, although selectivity to
furan was still high. Notably, the densely coated C18 catalysts
exhibited a dramatic improvement in selectivity towards the
desired products. In particular, the C18-coated 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3
catalyst exhibited over 55% selectivity to furfuryl alcohol and 35%
selectivity to methylfuran. As methylfuran is produced in a series

reaction from furfuryl alcohol, its selectivity can be improved to
470% even on the C18-coated 5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst at higher
conversion (see Supplementary Table S1).
Importantly,
although
the
overall
rate
of
reaction
was
decreased by the SAM coatings, as expected, this decrease was
nearly completely attributed to the undesirable DC pathway (see
Fig. 2b). As the SAM packing became increasingly dense, the rate
of DC decreased by three orders of magnitude. However, the rates
of aldehyde hydrogenation and HDO were nearly unaffected.
Thus, the increase in selectivity to the desired products was not
because of an increase in the rate of the desired reaction but
rather because of inhibition of the undesired reaction.
In previous work, we found that adsorption on catalyst terrace
sites was reduced systematically with increasing thiol SAM
density, whereas adsorption on step edges and defects was mostly
unaffected19. We therefore hypothesized that the reduction in the
rate of DC on the thiol-modiﬁed catalysts was a direct effect of
limiting access to terrace sites. Supporting this notion, single-
crystal studies of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde (functionally
similar to furfural) on Pd(111) have shown that DC to produce
benzene is dominant when the molecules can adopt a ﬂat-lying
conformation22.
In
addition,
density
functional
theory
calculations show that the furan ring in furfural preferentially
adsorbs in a threefold hollow site for ﬂat-lying structures7,8,23.
Thus, we expect that DC and RH occur primarily on threefold
terrace sites where a large contiguous ensemble of sites is
available. In the case of furfural, the high selectivity to furan on
both the uncoated and AT-modiﬁed catalysts suggested that the
ensemble requirement for DC was satisﬁed on these catalysts but
not on the C18-modiﬁed catalyst. As the rates of furfuryl alcohol
and methylfuran production were unaffected on the coated
catalysts, we hypothesize that these products were formed
primarily at the step edge and defect sites.
Identiﬁcation of adsorption sites by infrared spectroscopy. To
directly test the availability of speciﬁc adsorption sites, diffuse
reﬂectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was
performed under variable pressures of carbon monoxide; in these
experiments, peak positions are readily attributed to CO binding
in threefold, bridging and top sites24. We previously found that on
unmodiﬁed 5 wt% catalyst, increasing thiol density restricted
adsorption on terrace sites (Fig. 3a adapted from ref. 19). On the
more crowded C18-coated catalysts, CO adsorbed only on
threefold hollow (1,885 cm  1) and top sites at step edges and
defects (2,051 cm 1). On AT-coated catalysts, CO had additional
access to adsorption on terrace bridging (1,919 cm 1) and an
additional type of linear (2,077 cm 1) sites on terraces.
The C18-modiﬁed 1 wt% particles inhibited furan production
more than the same coating on the 5 wt% catalysts (Fig. 2). Thus,
if production of furan requires an ensemble of terrace sites, we
would expect to see limited terrace CO adsorption on C18-
modiﬁed 1 wt% catalysts. Figure 3b shows the DRIFT spectra for
the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed 1 wt% catalysts. The major peaks
at 1,905 and 1,863 cm  1 on the uncoated and AT catalysts,
respectively, were attributed to CO binding primarily on threefold
terrace sites. The smaller peak area for this feature on the AT
catalyst indicated reduced adsorption at terraces. On the C18
catalyst, this feature was essentially non-existent, supporting the
hypothesis that the crowded monolayer on these smaller particles
limited the availability of terrace sites. In contrast, the feature at
2,018 cm  1 was attributed to linear adsorption primarily at steps
and edges. This feature was also present on the uncoated 1%
catalyst at low pressures but was obscured at higher pressure by
species adsorbed linearly on terrace sites (see Supplementary Fig.
S3 for low CO pressure spectra). The peaks above 2,100 cm  1
were due to gas-phase CO, indicating that the catalysts were
saturated with CO.
Discussion
As the rates of production of furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran
were nearly the same on all the catalysts and the availability of
step and edge sites was mostly unaffected by the thiol modiﬁers,
we
suggest
that
the
production
of
these
species
occurs
preferentially at these sites, whereas furan production probably
requires terrace sites. The dearth of threefold hollow sites on the
1 wt% catalyst was presumably responsible for the absence of the
THF product, as RH requires a large number of contiguous
surface sites26,27 allowing the ring to lie ﬂat. The proposed
adsorption mechanism is depicted in Fig. 4.
In situ DRIFT spectroscopy during exposure to furfural on
modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed catalysts provided further evidence for
reduced DC and decomposition on the more crowded surfaces.
C18, AT and unmodiﬁed 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 were each exposed to
B60 (mg furfural fed)/(mg Pd  h) for 20 min using He carrier
gas. Spectra were collected after removing the gas-phase furfural
but still under the ﬂow of He (see Fig. 3c). The dashed spectra
show the catalyst before exposure to furfural for the uncoated, AT
and C18 catalysts. Before exposure, both C18- and AT-modiﬁed
catalysts exhibited spectral features associated with an ordered
monolayer, where the asymmetric methylene stretches were
observed at 2,923 and 2,915 cm  1 for C18 and AT, respectively.
This is compared with fcc(111) surfaces where these peaks were
observed at 2,918 and 2,911 cm  1, respectively20,28. In the case of
C18,
these
positions
are
intermediate
between
crystalline
(2,918 cm  1) and liquid-like (2,928 cm  1)29 features for C18.
The appearance of the broad C-H-stretching peaks between
B2,800 and 3,000 cm  1 on the uncoated catalyst indicated the
production of decomposition intermediates bound to the catalyst.
Single-crystal and density functional theory studies of furanic
species on Pd(111) have attributed stretches in this range to a
combination of CH and CH2 containing fragments from
adsorption of the furan ring and decomposition to surface
hydrocarbon species7,30,31. The appearance of CH2 stretches, not
present in the parent furfural molecule, may be attributed to
reaction of the adsorbed furan ring with surface hydrogen atoms
produced from decomposition of neighbouring adsorbates. On
the AT catalyst, the amount of furfural decomposition was
signiﬁcantly reduced; however, peaks at 2,852 and 2,973 cm  1,
similarly attributed to CH and CH2 stretches, indicated some
adsorption of the furan ring, consistent with the production of
both furan and THF on this catalyst. On the C18 catalyst, there
was essentially no production of decomposition products on the
catalyst after furfural exposure. The appearance of the broad peak
around B3,130 cm  1 and the peak at B2,805 cm  1, present on
all of the catalysts after furfural exposure, indicated the presence
of
the
symmetric
and
asymmetric
C-H
stretches
of
the
unsaturated
furan
ring
and
the
aldehyde
constituent,
respectively. These stretches are also present in the spectrum of
liquid-like furfural32, suggesting the presence of physisorbed or
weakly chemisorbed furfural on all catalyst surfaces.
Spectra obtained after exposure to furfural also provided direct
information about the extent of DC (Fig. 3d) in the form of the
presence of bound CO. The uncoated catalyst showed signiﬁcant
CO binding in both threefold and bridging sites (peak at
1,920 cm  1). CO production on the AT-modiﬁed catalyst
occurred primarily on threefold sites and was reduced with
respect to the uncoated catalyst. Minimal CO production
occurred on the C18 catalyst, with a small amount formed at
the threefold hollow sites, likely at defects in the SAM.
Adsorption to these sites can be seen in the results of CO

DRIFTS experiments on C18-modiﬁed 5 wt% Pd Al2O3 but not
the C18-modiﬁed 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3, consistent with the decreased
rate of production of furan on the C18-modiﬁed 1 wt%. These
results again support the kinetic data, demonstrating that DC is
inhibited by increasing modiﬁer crowding on the catalyst terraces.
In summary, we have shown that alkanethiolate SAM-modiﬁed
Pd catalysts increase the selectivity of furfural hydrogenation to
furfuryl alcohol and methylfuran by limiting the availability of
particular surface sites. By using a less dense SAM, such as one
created by AT, a portion of the threefold terrace sites can be
blocked and the rate of DC and RH decreased. Using a dense
SAM, such as one created by octadecanethiol, access to the
threefold sites can be severely limited, drastically reducing the
rate of DC leading to selectivity enhancement for aldehyde
hydrogenation and HDO. Thus, active-site selection using SAM
modiﬁers in catalysis can potentially serve as an alternative (or
complement) to recent efforts33–36 aimed at modifying shape, and
thus surface-site distribution, of supported metal nanoparticles to
control selectivity.
Methods
Materials. Pd/Al2O3 catalysts (5 and 1 wt%), 1-octadecanethiol (98%), AT (95%),
furfural (99%) and 200-proof HPLC-grade ethanol were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. Catalysts were used as received for uncoated reactions. Ultra-high purity
H2 and He were obtained from Airgas.
SAM preparation and characterization. AT and C18 SAMs were deposited on
the catalysts by dissolving the thiol in 40 ml ethanol at a concentration of
4.25 mmol l  1. The surface area of the less disperse 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 (D ¼ 0.266)
was B2.7  that of the more disperse 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3 (D ¼ 0.414) per mass of
supported catalyst, as determined by TEM (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Thus,
250 mg of 1 wt% Pd/Al2O3 or 100 mg of 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 was added to the solution
to expose a similar surface area of Pd to the thiol solution. The catalysts were
allowed to settle for at least 12 h. The supernatant was decanted, and 40 ml ethanol
was added to wash off any excess thiol that had not adsorbed. The catalysts were
allowed to settle for an additional 2 h, and then the supernatant was decanted. The
catalysts were allowed to dry in air before use.
The sulphur content was analysed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectrometry. The results demonstrated that there was 2.1  the amount
of sulphur present on the C18 catalysts than that on the AT catalysts, which is
approximately the amount expected from differences in coverage on single-crystal
surfaces (B1.8  more molecules for the C18 surface20,21). No sulphur adsorption
was found on pure Al2O3. In addition, an approximate thiolate concentration was
inferred from the hydrocarbon-stretching region of the freshly modiﬁed catalysts.
With 18 carbons for C18 and 10 for AT, the total hydrocarbon peak area was
nominally expected to be B3.3  greater for the C18 catalyst, taking into account
the 1.8  difference in coverage. Actual peaks from Fig. 3 showed B3.7  greater
areas, indicating a more densely packed monolayer for the C18 than AT. Although
the overall packing density of the C18 SAM was higher, defects were almost
certainly present. Overall, the C18- and AT-modiﬁed catalysts exhibited features
associated with an ordered monolayer where the asymmetric methylene stretches
were observed at 2,923 and 2,915 cm  1 for each catalyst coating, respectively. This
is compared with fcc(111) surfaces where these peaks were observed at 2,918 and
2,911 cm  1, respectively20,28.
Catalytic reactions. Hydrogenations were conducted in a tubular packed bed ﬂow
reactor at 190 C and atmospheric pressure. Helium was bubbled through furfural
(Sigma-Aldrich) to achieve furfural gas-phase concentration yfurfural ¼ 0.016 and
mixed with H2 at a 25:1 molar ratio of H2 to furfural. The amount of catalyst used
was varied systematically to achieve a conversion of 13±2% in all cases; weight
hourly space velocities are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Each reaction was run
for at least 200 min; selectivity and conversion at the end of this period are reported
here. Additional reactions were performed varying temperature and conversion to
demonstrate the sequential nature of the reaction; as conversion increased, more
methylfuran was produced relative to furfuryl alcohol and vice versa for decreased
conversion (Supplementary Table S1), indicating that reaction selectivity could be
tuned using conversion. Representative kinetic plots showing selectivity and con-
version as a function of time on stream (Supplementary Fig. S4) reveal that over the
course of the reaction, the uncoated catalyst experiences continuously decreasing
activity. Conversely, the C18-coated catalyst exhibits constant conversion, showing
that the SAMs are mostly stable under reaction conditions. Additional reactions
were performed using the uncoated and C18-coated 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3, allowing the
reaction to proceed for at least 15 h to further examine the stability of selectivity,
conversion and SAM coating (Supplementary Fig. S5). Comparison of reaction
selectivity at 4 and 15 h shows no signiﬁcant increase in the selectivity to furan for
the C18-coated catalyst but a drop in conversion from 12 to 5%. DRIFT spectra
before and after 15 h of reaction reveal a 3- and 5-cm  1 shift in the peak positions
for asymmetric and symmetric methylene stretching, respectively. These data
indicated some disordering of the monolayer, possibly because of the generation of
gauche defects20. Importantly, the SAM was still present on the surface under
reaction conditions at the time that selectivity and rates are reported. For stable
operation over longer reaction times, it may be desirable to pursue approaches such
as post-assembly crosslinking of SAMs37.
The gas mixture passed over the catalyst and the reactor efﬂuent was analysed
using an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a
30  0.320 mm2 Agilent HP-5 capillary column and ﬂame ionization detector
(split ratio ¼ 25:1, column ﬂow rate ¼ 2 ml min  1, oven temperature ¼ 50 C).
A representative gas chromatograph is shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. Turnover
frequencies for individual products reported in Fig. 2b are calculated by dividing
the product ﬂow rates by the number of surface sites on unmodiﬁed catalyst, based
on the size of the metal particles and mass of catalyst used.
Fourier transform infrared analysis. Fourier transform infrared analysis was
performed using a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet 6700 FT-IR with a closed cell
attachment (Harrick) for DRIFTS. Fifty scans at 4 cm  1 resolution were used for
each spectrum. The quality of all coated samples was characterized in the C-H-
stretching region (2,800–3,000 cm  1) to conﬁrm monolayer formation before
catalytic testing. For CO DRIFT experiments, catalyst samples were placed in a
gastight cell that was evacuated to achieve an initial baseline pressure of o0.10
Torr. The 1% catalysts were determined to have B2.7  fewer active sites per gram
of supported catalyst (as determined by TEM imaging), which resulted in an
overall weaker signal intensity in the DRIFT spectra (Fig. 3b). In addition, the
signal was further weakened because a reduced sample mass was loaded into the
sample cup because of the lower density of the alumina support for the 1% Pd/
Al2O3 catalyst. Differences in the apparent density of the alumina support were
determined to be B3  . TEM images conﬁrm a more porous Al2O3 support
morphology for the 1% catalysts (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). This resulted in a
weaker signal on the 1% catalyst than on the 5% catalyst (B8  ).
