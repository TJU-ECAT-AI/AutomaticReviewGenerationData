The relationshi 
p between surface crowding and catalytic activity was investigated using thiolate self- 
assemble 
d monolayers (SAMs) on Pd/Al 
2O3 catalysts. The surface density of the thiolate modiﬁer was 
controll 
ed by varying the steric bulk of the organic substituent. A straight-chain alkanethiol 1-octadeca- 
nethiol (C18), with a nearest-neighbor spacing of 4.7 Å on Pd(111) surfaces, created a denser SAM coat- 
ing than 1-adamantanethi 
ol (AT) with a nearest-neighbor spacing of 6.4 Å. Diffuse reﬂectance infrared 
spectroscopy revealed that CO adsorbate molecules adsorbed only on threefold hollow and atop sites on
C18-modiﬁed surfaces. On AT-modiﬁed surfaces, however, access to bridging and additional linear sites 
was also observed. Analysis of adsorption isotherms suggested that CO adsorption energies were comp 
a-
rable on AT-modiﬁed and C18-modiﬁed catalysts. Acetyl 
ene hydrogenation, which results in uncon- 
trolled crowding due to carbonaceous ‘‘coke’’ formation on the catalyst, was found to be insensitive to
modiﬁcation by the thiols. For hydrogenation reactions less associated with uncontrolled coking, crowd- 
ing – and therefore reactivity – could be controlled systematically using SAMs. In particular, ethylene 
hydrogenation was 17 times faster on AT-coat 
ed surfaces than on C18-coated surfaces, consistent with 
the additional accessibility to speciﬁc sites unavailable on C18-modi 
ﬁed surfaces. The effect of modiﬁer
density on reactivity was found to be dramatically different for several mono- and bi-functional reactants 
in a manner consistent with previous literature reports, suggesting that controlled crowding with SAMs 
can be used to understand reaction structure sensitivity and active site requirements in catalysis.

1. Introductio 
n
Self-assembled monolay 
ers (SAMs) have recently been utilized 
as modiﬁers to control reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis 
[1–5]. For example, alkanethiol SAMs improved the selectivity of
1-epoxybut 
ane formatio 
n from 1-epoxy-3-b 
utene (EpB) on sup- 
ported Pd catalysts from 11% to 94% under equivalent reaction con- 
ditions. One of the major advantages of SAM-bas 
ed modiﬁers is
their ability to form highly ordered, consistent structures on metal 
surfaces. This consistency is presumably attributable to the ther- 
modynamical 
ly limited assembly process, which also facilitates 
connections between catalysis and surface science studies. In addi- 
tion, both the attachment chemistry and tail groups can easily be
tailored to create monolayers with desirable surface properties.
These features potentially make SAMs useful modiﬁers for study- 
ing the effect of controlled surface modiﬁcation on catalytic reac- 
tivity. However, though a previous surface science study has 
shown that well-ordere 
d SAMs on Pd(111) inhibit epoxide 
ring-openi 
ng while permitting oleﬁn adsorption [6], the detailed 
effect of SAMs on the nature of available active sites has not been 
explored in detail. This is particularly true for supported nanopar- 
ticle catalysts, where the presence of signiﬁcant numbers of corner,
edge, and defect sites may create uncertainties in the effect on
active sites.
The effect of surface crowding, i.e. modiﬁer density, on catalytic 
reactivity is of signiﬁcant practical importance 
. Uncontrolled sur-
face crowding in the form of carbonaceous coke can occur when 
reactant molecule 
s strongly adsorb and decompose on a catalyst 
surface. This process is prevalent in a number of important indus- 
trial applications [7] including hydrogenati 
on [8], steam reforming 
[9,10], and dehydrogen 
ation [11]. In addition, sulfur, which is often 
naturally present in hydrocarbon feedstocks [12], has the ability to
essentiall 
y poison a reaction when present at high coverage, but 
has been used as a modiﬁer at lower coverage to drive selectivity 
of reactions toward more desired products [13,14]. Despite the 
prevalen 
ce of this modiﬁcation technique, a deep understand 
ing 
of the effect of modiﬁer density on catalytic reactivity is lacking.
Given that subtle changes in surface density can dramatically affect 
the electroni 
c and steric interactions between reactants and the 
surface, it is important to develop systemati 
c methods to examine 
these phenomena

In this study, we demonstrat 
e the ability to control modiﬁer
surface density systemati 
cally by tuning the thiol tail chemistry 
to form monolay 
ers with varying sulfur coverage. As expected, in
situations where an irreversibly adsorbed coke layer forms (e.g.
acetylene hydrogenati 
on), the SAM coating does not affect the 
reactivity. However, in the absence of coking, crowding can be sys- 
tematically controlled using SAMs. This is achieved by using a den- 
sely packed, straight-chain alkanethiol 1-octadecanethi 
ol (C18)
and a bulky caged hydrocarbon thiol 1-adamantane 
thiol (AT) to
control thiol density on the surface via differenc 
es in the steric bulk 
of the organic substituent of the thiol modiﬁer. Kinetic measure- 
ments were performed in conjunct 
ion with IR spectroscopy to de- 
velop a deeper understanding of the ways in which surface 
crowding affects adsorption and reactivity, which can be rational- 
ized in terms of speciﬁc surface site availability. This knowled 
ge
provides insight that could lead to improved catalyst modiﬁcation
and could be a useful technique for directing selectivity for other 
reactions.
2. Experimen 
tal 
2.1. Materials and sample preparati 
on
Pd/Al2O3 (5 wt%), 1-octadecan 
ethiol (98%), 1-adamantane 
thiol 
(95%), 1-2-epoxy 
butane (99%), and 200-proof HPLC-grad 
e ethanol 
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. CO chemisorpti 
on (Quanta-
chrome Autosorb-1) was previousl 
y used to determine a metal sur- 
face area of 3.74 m2 g1 on the uncoated catalyst [1]. The 
palladium metal dispersion was 16.8%, and the average metal par- 
ticle diameter was 6.7 nm. Propiona 
ldehyde (97%) was obtained 
from Fisher Scientiﬁc. Acetylene and ethylene (10% hydrocarbo 
n,
balance helium) and all other gases were obtained from Airgas. Be- 
fore testing, all catalyst samples were oxidized at 573 K in 20% oxy- 
gen for 2 h, subsequent 
ly reduced at 473 K in 20% hydrogen for at
least 2 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperat 
ure before 
deposition and/or testing. For thiol deposition, modiﬁed catalysts 
were then placed in 1 mM ethanolic solution for between 12 and 
24 h. After deposition, samples were washed once with ethanol,
decanted, and then dried under vacuum for at least 2 h before char- 
acterization to conﬁrm complete SAM formation.
2.2. Catalytic reactions 
All catalytic reactions were carried out in a gas-phase plug ﬂow
reactor and were monitore 
d using an Agilent 5890A gas chromato- 
graph equipped with a ﬂame ionization detector, DB-FFAP capillary 
column, and Agilent software. Hydrogenation reactions were per- 
formed at 323 K using a 10:1 hydrogen to reactant feed ratio where 
total ﬂow rates for each reaction were between 50 and 100 sccm.
Liquid reactants were temperat 
ure controlle 
d and bubbled through 
the system using helium carrier gas where Antoine parameters 
were used to determine reactant vapor pressure. The amount of
catalyst used for both modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed surfaces was 
dependent on the speciﬁc reactivity of each reaction but was cho- 
sen to achieve <5% conversio 
n in all cases. All samples were diluted 
to 300 mg using inert Al2O3. Rates are reported per gram of catalyst 
as opposed to turnover frequencies in order to make comparisons 
about activity between modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed catalysts. In order 
to determine the true turnover frequencies on coated catalysts,
knowledge of the number of active sites on modiﬁed catalysts 
would be needed. While this is still a subject of debate, turnover 
frequencies normalized to the known surface area of the uncoated
system can be calculated from the reported rates. These TOFs are 
reported in the discussion below, so that rates for all reactions 
and catalysts can be interpreted on a per-surface metal atom basis.
2.3. FT-IR analysis 
FT-IR analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet 
6700 FT-IR with a closed cell attachment (Harrick) for Diffuse 
Reﬂectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrosc 
opy (DRIFTS).
Fifty scans at 4 cm1 resolution were used for each spectrum.
The quality of all coated samples was characteri 
zed in the C–H
stretchin 
g region (2800–3000 cm1) to conﬁrm monolayer forma- 
tion prior to catalytic testing. For CO DRIFT experiments, catalyst 
samples were placed in a gas tight cell that was evacuated to
achieve an initial baseline pressure of <0.10 Torr. Successiv 
e doses 
of CO were then introduce 
d into the cell at CO pressure 
s of 0.15,
0.27, 0.50, 1.20, 2.00, and 300 torr. After each dose, spectra were ta- 
ken after at least 10 min to allow the system to come to equilib- 
rium. At pressure 
s above 300 torr, gas-phase CO was observed 
indicating the surface was at CO saturatio 
n.
3. Results/d 
iscussion 
The formation and structure of straight-cha 
in alkanethiol mon- 
olayers have been studied extensively on metal surfaces [15].
When thiol molecule 
s are exposed to metal surfaces, the sulfur 
head groups bind covalently to the metal producing a highly or- 
dered monolayer that forms a (

)R30 adsorption geometry 
on fcc(111) surfaces. The spacing between sulfur atoms on Au and 
Pd surfaces has been determined to be 5.0 Å [16,17] and 4.7 Å
[18], respectively 
. Monolayer 
s formed using 1-adamantane 
thiol 
have also been investiga 
ted on Au surfaces. For these types of mon- 
olayers, the spacing between sulfur groups has been found to be
6.9 Å with a proposed (7  7) unit cell structure [19]. This spacing 
corresponds to a nearest neighbor distance of 6.4 Å on Pd. Fig. 1
shows the DRIFT spectra in the C–H stretching regime and struc- 
ture of the molecule 
s used to form monolayers in this study. For 
the C18-coated catalyst, the methylen 
e d-stretching mode was ob- 
served at 2921 cm1, consistent with an ordered SAM on polycrys- 
talline palladium [17]. AT monolayers have not been studied 
previousl 
y on Pd using IR spectroscopy. Here, the asymmetric 
and symmetric methylene stretches were observed at 2918 cm1
and 2854 cm1, respectively 
. This is compare 
d to Au(111) surfaces 
where these peaks were observed at 2911 cm1 and 2850 cm1,
respectively [20]. Peak positions of characteristic C–H stretches 
can, in general, be used only to gain a broad sense of monolay 
er
structure and provide minimal information about absolute mono- 
layer coverage 
. Additional information about coverage can be
determined from the CO ‘‘titration’’ technique described in this 
work.
3.1. Controlled vs. uncontrolled crowding: ethylene vs. acetylene 
Uncontrolled surface crowding can occur when reactant mole- 
cules decompose on the surface to form irreversibly adsorbed coke 
species; this process is known to occur during acetylene hydroge- 
nation [21]. For uncontrolled crowding conditions where signiﬁ-
cant coking occurs, the irreversibl 
y adsorbed reactants produce 
their own surface environment with a unique chemical character.
In this situation, it is expected that the SAMs will have less effect 
on the reactivity of the catalyst because of the layer produced by
the reactants, i.e. the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed surfaces become 
less distinguisha 
ble to adsorbed reactants. In situation 
s where sig- 
niﬁcant coking does not occur (e.g. ethylene hydrogenati 
on [22]),
we hypothesize that surface crowding can be controlled systemat- 
ically using SAMs.
To demonst 
rate the effects of uncontro 
lled vs. controlle 
d
crowding 
, hydrogenation rates were measure 
d on unmodiﬁed,
AT-, and C18-modiﬁed surfaces for the hydrogenati 
on of acetylene

and ethylene. Results are shown in Fig. 2. Results are presented 
after 1 h time-on-str 
eam after which steady-state conditions 
were achieved. The turnover frequencies for ethylene hydrogena- 
tion and acetylene hydrogenation were calculated to be 340 s1
and 3 s1, respectively 
, on the uncoated catalyst. As expected, the 
rate of acetylene hydrogenation was indisting 
uishable on coated 
or uncoated Pd surfaces at steady-state. For the initial time-on- 
stream, the thiol-coa 
ted catalysts showed slightly lower activity 
than the uncoated catalyst. This differenc 
e in activity remained 
more-or-less constant over the ﬁrst 40 min at which point the 
uncoated catalyst reached steady-state. Afterward, typically within 
10–20 min, thiol-coa 
ted catalysts achieved steady-state. During 
this initial period, thiol-coated catalysts showed improved selec- 
tivity over uncoated catalysts toward ethylene formation (20%).
However, this improvement was no longer observed after steady- 
state conditions were achieved. Unlike the case with acetylene,
the rate of ethylene hydrogen 
ation, which occurs in the absence 
of signiﬁcant coking, systematically decreased with increasing sul- 
fur coverage.
To directly probe the presence of uncontrolled crowding (i.e.
coking), DRIFT spectra were recorded for modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed
samples before and after a 1-h exposure to reaction conditions for 
acetylene and ethylene hydrogenation. These spectra are shown in
Fig. 3.
The spectra before and after acetylene hydrogenati 
on demon- 
strate clearly that a surface coke layer was acquired during the 
reaction, whereas there was no evidence for this for samples ex- 
posed to ethylene reaction conditions. As conﬁrmed by the identi- 
cal reaction rates on modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed surfaces for 
acetylene hydrogenation, SAMs do not affect the reactivity of the 
reaction when signiﬁcant coking occurs. However, for reactions 
where coking is not signiﬁcant, SAMs can be used to systemati 
cally 
control surface crowding to examine how the modiﬁed surface af- 
fects reactivity.
3.2. Effect of crowding on surface reactivity 
An illustration of the unit cells for C18 and AT monolayers on
fcc(111) surfaces is shown in Fig. 4.
From a simple geometric perspective, the sulfur on the more- 
dense C18 monolay 
er covers 1.8 more Pd surface area than 
AT surfaces assuming a sulfur radius of 180 pm. However, hydro- 
genation rates for ethylene on AT surfaces were found to be a factor 
of 17 faster than on C18-mod 
iﬁed catalysts (Fig. 2). The discrep- 
ancy between measured rates and available space suggests that 
sulfur attachment density alone is not sufﬁcient to explain the 
higher rate on AT-coated catalysts. We suggest two hypotheses 
that could potentially explain this discrepancy 
: (1) the ethylene 
adsorptio 
n strength is reduced in the presence of a more dense 
layer of sulfur, and/or (2) speciﬁc, more highly reactive sites are 
more accessible on the AT-coated catalyst. The presence of sulfur 
has been shown to reduce the adsorption strength of a number 
of species including carbon monoxide and ethylene [23,24]. This 
effect has been suggested to be coverage dependent, so it is possi- 
ble that the more densely packed C18 monolayers could reduce the 
adsorptio 
n strength of reactants more signiﬁcantly than AT mono- 
layers leading to lower activity on these surfaces. An alternative 
explanat 
ion involves the different types of sites exposed on C18 
vs. AT surfaces. Speciﬁcally, the theoretical packing geometry of a
C18 monolayer does not readily expose atop sites except presum- 
ably at defects. Atop sites are thought to be the preferred reaction 
site in ethylene hydrogenation where pi-bound species preferen- 
tially adsorb and react [25–27], which may be responsible for en- 
hanced activity.
To gain further insight into the competing hypotheses of
adsorptio 
n strength and site accessibility, CO DRIFT spectroscopy 
was performed on uncoated, AT-, and C18-coated surfaces. Sam- 
ples were exposed to increasing amounts of CO ranging from 
0.15 to 300 torr, and spectra were taken after 10 min to allow for 
samples to come to equilibriu 
m. Results are shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5a illustrates how the spectrum developed as a function of
increasing CO coverage on the uncoated surface. These results were 
similar to previous observations on palladium surfaces and cata- 
lysts [28,29]. At low CO coverage, two major features were appar- 
ent at 2065 and 1951 cm1. The weak feature at 2065 cm1 was
indicative of CO bound to atop sites. The more prominent feature 
at 1951 cm1 has been attributed to a combination of bonding in
bridging and threefold hollow sites. Upon increasing CO pressure,
the peak initially at 2065 cm1 was found to shift to 2090 cm1
consisten 
t with increasing dipole coupling interactions [30]. In
addition, at pressures above 1.2 torr, there appeared to be two 
distinct features suggesting linear adsorptio 
n to two types of atop 
sites. Similarly, two features became apparent upon increasing CO
pressure for the peak initially at 1951 cm1. At saturatio 
n, three 
major bands were discernible at 1938, 1990, and 2090 cm1. The 
peaks at 2090 and 1938 cm1 were attributed to CO bound on atop 
and bridging/ho 
llow sites, respectively. The peak at 1990 cm1 was
indicative of CO adsorbed on (100) facets and bridge-bond 
ed to
particle edges and steps.

The thiol-mod 
iﬁed surfaces exhibited two major features. For 
the AT-coated sample, the peak initially at 1897 cm1 is indicative 
of CO adsorbed in threefold hollow sites. With increasing pressure 
,
this peak was observed to shift to 1921 cm1 which is consisten 
t
with CO dipole coupling and increasing occupation of bridge- 
bound sites [28]. The peak initially measured at 2043 cm1 was
found to shift to 2077 cm1 with increasing pressure and is attrib- 
uted to linear bound CO experiencing a similar increase in dipole 
interactions 
. Two similar features were observed for the C18- 
coated sample. The peak initially at 1873 cm1 (threefold hollow)
was found to shift to 1886 cm1 while the peak at 2039 cm1 (lin-
ear) was found to shift to 2052 cm1 with increasing pressure. The 
proposed peak assignment 
s for each catalyst are given in Table 1.
Generally speaking, the peak areas for the AT-modiﬁed catalyst 
features were signiﬁcantly larger than that were observed for the 
C18-modiﬁed surface. This indicated that more CO was able to ad- 
sorb on AT-coated surfaces. The shifts for the multi-coor 
dinated 
and linear bound features for the AT-modiﬁed catalyst were found 
to be 34 cm1 and 24 cm1, respectively 
. The shifts for these same 
features were found to be 13 cm1 and 13 cm1 on the C18 surface.
The greater shift for the AT surface is likely related to a greater 
amount of dipole coupling interactions that occur on these less- 
densely precovered surfaces. For the C18 sample, increasing the 
pressure of CO increased the total amount adsorbed on the surface,
but the reduced peak shifting suggested that there are fewer inter- 
actions of neighbori 
ng CO molecules than is seen on the AT-coated 
surfaces.
In addition to the greater amount of total CO adsorbed on the 
uncoated surface, as evidenced by the larger total peak areas, in
general, the unmodiﬁed surface exhibited a greater heterogeneity 
of sites available for CO adsorption. Speciﬁcally, the feature found 
at 1990 cm1 was not observed for either of the coated surfaces,
suggestin 
g that CO is not signiﬁcantly bridge-bondi 
ng to (100) fac- 
ets and step sites on thiol-coated surfaces.
3.2.1. Adsorption strength 
To probe the effect of monolayer density on adsorption 
strength, an adsorption coefﬁcient ratio was extracted from the 
AT and C18 isotherms for the multi-coordina 
ted species. As a ﬁrst
approximat 
ion, data were ﬁt using a Langmuir isotherm adsorption 
model. This model is used only to gain a general sense of the differ- 
ences in CO adsorption strength since there are assumpti 
ons of the 
model that are not likely satisﬁed here including: (1) no interac- 
tions between adsorbat 
e molecule 
s and (2) site equivalency. The 
Langmuir equation is expressed as:
C ¼ Cmax
Kc
1 þ Kc
ð1Þ
where K is the Langmui 
r adsorptio 
n constan 
t, c is the gaseous par- 
tial pressure, C is the amount adsorbe 
d, and Cmax is the maxim 
um
amount adsorbe 
d as c increases. C was estimated from integrated 
peak areas for the multi-c 
oordinate 
d species (Fig. 5d). The Langmu 
ir
equation was linearized using the Eadie–Hofstee form where:
C ¼ Cmax  C
Kc
ð2Þ
Thus, a plot of C vs. C/c yields a slope of 1/K and an intercept 
Cmax. The heteroge 
neity of the uncoated surface complicates this 
type of simple analysis because of the additional types of adsorp- 
tion sites that are accessible at higher CO pressure. For this reason,
this analysis is used only to estimate differences between C18 and 
AT surfaces which demonstrate similar, Langmuir 
-type adsorption 
behavior. The linearized plots for the AT and C18 surfaces are 
shown in Fig. 6.
From these data, an adsorption coefﬁcient ratio KAT
KC18 ¼ KRel was
determined from the slopes and found to be KRel = 1.58 ± 0.19.
The general expression for the adsorption coefﬁcient can be de- 
scribed in terms of the enthalpic and entropic contributi 
ons by
the following relationship:
K ¼ Ae
Uads 
RT
ð3Þ
where Uads is the adsorptio 
n energy, A is the exponen 
tial prefactor,
R is the ideal gas constan 
t, and T is the temperat 
ure. Assuming 
entropic losses (and thus A factors) are similar upon adsorptio 
n
for both thiol-mo 
diﬁed surfaces 
, this expressio 
n can be solved from 
the above adsorptio 
n coefﬁcients to determine an approxim 
ate dif- 
ference in adsorption energy on the two modiﬁed surfaces. From 
this method, the difference in adsorptio 
n energy is estimated to
be (1.1 ± 0.3) kJ/mo 
l, such that adsorption on the AT-modiﬁed cat- 
alyst is slightly more exotherm 
ic. It is likely that entropic losses are 
in fact greater for adsorptio 
n on the C18 catalyst than on the AT cat- 
alyst. However, a greater loss in entropy on the C18 catalyst would 
subsequen 
tly require greater adsorptio 
n energy in order for the 
binding constant, K, to remain unchan 
ged. This would result in a
smaller estima 
ted difference in adsorption energy between the 
C18 and AT catalysts. The estima 
ted value of (1.1 ± 0.3) kJ/mol for 
the difference in adsorptio 
n energy thus represents the upper-limit 
estima 
tion for this calculatio 
n.

This small difference in energy between CO adsorption on the 
AT and C18 surfaces may be rationalized by consideri 
ng both 
CO–CO and CO–S adsorbate interactions on the surface. The 
adsorption energy of carbon monoxide on clean Pd surfaces 
(125–200 kJ/mole) tends to decrease with increasing CO coverage 
[31–33]. Similarly, the presence of sulfur has been shown to de- 
crease the adsorption strength of CO [34]. This combined effect 
was investigated by Kiskinova et al. [23] who demonst 
rated that 
the effect of sulfur on the activation energy for CO desorptio 
n on
Pt(111) is of the same order of magnitude as that experienced 
by CO in denser CO overlayers on a sulfur-free surface. Speciﬁcally,
the desorption energy of CO at hCO  0.4 was found to be the same 
as the desorption energy of CO on a precovered sulfur surface 
(hS  0.25) for CO coverage of hCO < 0.11. Consequentl 
y, while the 
higher sulfur coverage on the C18 surface (hS  0.33) reduces CO
adsorption strength, it is likely that on the less dense AT surface,
(hS  0.18) the greater CO coverage has a similar effect on adsorp- 
tion strength. This may explain why differences in adsorption en- 
ergy are not more dramatic in the presence of higher sulfur 
coverage on the C18 surface.
The initial adsorption strength of ethylene and CO on Pd sur- 
faces are similar (130–185 kJ/mole for strongly bound ethyli- 
dyne), and both also decrease with coverage due to adsorbate 
interactio 
ns [24,35]. We therefore hypothes 
ize that the effect of
surface crowding on adsorptio 
n energy would be related for CO
and ethylene. The minor differenc 
e in adsorption energy between 
the two modiﬁed surfaces suggests that differenc 
es in adsorption 
energy alone do not likely account for the dramatic differences ob- 
served in reactivity between C18 and AT surfaces. Given the differ- 
ences between the binding of CO and ethylene to the metal surface,
a role for differenc 
es in ethylene adsorption energy cannot be ruled 
out. However, previous surface science investiga 
tions of SAM- 
coated Pd(111) surfaces have shown that SAMs have a similar 
inﬂuence on oleﬁn adsorption as other coadsorbates, suggesting 
that thiols do not have a strong, highly speciﬁc electronic effect 
on ethylene adsorptio 
n [6].

denced by the peak shoulder that begins to form at pressures 
above 1.2 torr. It is possible that the additional higher frequency 
peak was due to on-top CO on the (111) terraces [36]. Similarly 
at this pressure, there was a signiﬁcant jump in the integrated peak 
area (Fig. 5d) for this feature on the AT surface which suggested 
adsorption to two types of atop sites on this surface. From these 
observations 
, it is suggested that adsorptio 
n on AT-modiﬁed cata- 
lysts occurs on threefold hollow, bridging, and two types of atop 
sites. In contrast, there is no evidence for a second type of atop 
adsorption site on the C18-modiﬁed surface. Adsorption on C18- 
coated surfaces is suggested to occur only on threefold hollow sites 
and a single type of atop site.
There is strong evidence suggesting that there are speciﬁc types 
of sites required in order for a particular reaction pathway to occur 
for a number of reactions, while ethylene is capable of adsorbing 
on different sites in multiple adsorption geometri 
es on Pd surfaces.
It has been proposed that the most reactive form of ethylene is the 
pi-bound species on atop sites [25]. The additional adsorption on
atop sites on the AT surface is consistent with the higher activity 
on this surface for ethylene hydrogen 
ation. Scheme 1 highlights
the proposed differences in ethylene adsorption on the two thiol- 
modiﬁed catalysts. The more crowded C18 catalyst restricts 
adsorption primarily to atop sites on edges and more compact 
geometries (e.g. ethylidyne adsorptio 
n within monolay 
er) within 
the monolayer. In addition to these species, the greater sulfur spac- 
ing on the AT catalyst allows the reactive pi-bound species to ad- 
sorb and react on terrace top sites.
3.3. Reactivity of speciﬁc functional groups 
The lowest energy reaction pathway on a surface is often asso- 
ciated with a particular type of site or ensemble of sites [37].
Changing the accessibility of different types of sites by altering 
monolayer density is therefore expected to inﬂuence catalytic 
activity of different reactive groups to varying extents. This idea 
was tested by measuring and comparing the hydrogen 
ation rates 
of a number of simple reactants on uncoated, C18-coat 
ed, and 
AT-coated surfaces. Rates on AT and C18 surfaces normalized by
the uncoated rate are shown in Fig. 7.
In order to probe the effect of modiﬁer density on the reactivity 
of speciﬁc functional groups, the hydrogenati 
on rates of three 
monofuncti 
onal reactants were measured including ethylene, 1-
epoxybutane, and propionaldehy 
de to represent oleﬁn, epoxide,
and aldehyde functionality, respectivel 
y. As expected, the rate of
reductions on the thiol-modiﬁed surfaces was dramatically differ- 
ent depending on the reacting functional group. For hydrogenolys 
is
of 1-epoxybut 
ane to 2-butanol, the reaction rate is drastical 
ly de- 
creased even for the AT coating. Though detailed mechanistic 
investigatio 
ns for the ensemble size requiremen 
t of epoxide 
hydrogen 
olysis have to our knowledge not been reported, previous 
studies of
hydrogenolysis reactions (including
cyclopropane 
hydrogen 
olysis) have revealed that these reactions are highly 
structure sensitive [38–41] with a recent study using supported 
Pt catalysts reporting a required ensemble size of seven contiguous 
Pt atoms [42]. The dramatic reduction in rate for the AT catalyst 
(and further decrease for C18) in our studies is consistent with a
large ensemble size requirement for this reaction.
A contrasting case is the hydrogenati 
on of propionaldehy 
de,
where the AT-modiﬁed catalyst and C18-modiﬁed catalyst exhibit 
similar reactivity. Furthermore, the reactivity is relatively high 
compare 
d to the uncoated catalyst. This behavior suggests that 
aldehyde hydrogenati 
on should be highly structure insensitiv 
e, in
agreement with previous ﬁndings [43]. In fact, many catalysts 
effective for hydrogenati 
on of aldehydes involve Pt-group sites 
that are heavily modiﬁed by other adsorbates, promoting weak

Scheme 1. Proposed adsorption mechanism on thiol-modiﬁed surfaces. On C18 
catalysts, adsorption primarily occurs in threefold hollow and a single type of atop 
site at saturation coverage. On AT-coated catalysts, adsorption occurs on these same 
types of sites but has additional access to bridging and a second type of reactive,
linear site upon increasing coverage.

interactions between the aldehyde and site that are associated 
with high reactivity [44–46]. Thus, the extra crowding on the 
C18 catalyst has a minimal effect on reaction rate. An alternative 
hypothesis is that this reaction occurs primarily at edges/defect 
sites. It is likely that the number of exposed defect sites would 
be approximat 
ely the same for thiol-modiﬁed catalysts. Conse- 
quently, reaction rates are also expected to be similar in cases 
where reactions occur primarily at defects (regardless of mono- 
layer spacing). Overall, the signiﬁcant differenc 
es in reactivity ob- 
served for these functional groups conﬁrm that the effect of
modiﬁer density on reactivity depends strongly on the nature of
the reactant, and that controlled crowding with SAMs can eluci- 
date the active site requiremen 
ts for different reactions on metal 
catalysts.
To determine if these effects could be generaliz 
ed in terms of
distinct functional group reactivity, the hydrogenation rates of
the bi-functi 
onal reactants 3-methyl-2-buten 
al (prenal) and 1-
epoxy-3-buten 
e (EpB) were measure 
d on the same surfaces. The 
hydrogenati 
on rates of the functional constituents of these two 
molecules were compared to the reactivity of their monofunctional 
counterparts (Fig. 7) to determine if there was a general agreement 
in reactivity. The results indicated signiﬁcant differenc 
es both in
overall rate reduction on the thiol-modiﬁed surfaces and in rate 
differences between the AT and C18 surfaces for the reactivity of
each class of functional group. The most drastic differenc 
e was 
found between the epoxide containing reactants. For 1-epoxybu- 
tane and EpB, reductions in rate on the AT-modiﬁed catalyst were 
found to be a factor of 100 and 4, respectively 
, whereas differ- 
ences in rate between the AT- and C18-coated surfaces for these 
epoxides were found to be a factor of 3 and 10, respectively.
It has been shown on hexanethiol-m 
odiﬁed surfaces that the oleﬁn
constituent interacts more strongly with the surface than the epox- 
ide on Pd(111) [6]. We then hypothesize that the presence of the 
oleﬁn constituent in the EpB molecule increases the overall reac- 
tant interaction with the surface and, in turn, the rate of hydroge- 
nation of the epoxide function, resulting in the greater epoxide 
hydrogenati 
on rate of EpB compared to 1-epoxybutane. In other 
words, the presence of the oleﬁn constituent in EpB has a dramatic 
effect on the reactivity of the epoxide functionality. It is similarly 
observed for the other reactants that the presence of additional 
reactive groups affects the overall reactivity of the molecule [44].
From these observations, it is determined that the effects of mod- 
iﬁer density cannot be generalized in terms of the reactivity of
independen 
t functional groups. Instead, each reactant is uniquely 
inﬂuenced by differenc 
es in modiﬁer density. Nevertheles 
s, the 
different ensemble requirements of different reactions may allow 
for surface crowding to be used as a strategy to control selectivity.
4. Conclusi 
on
Here, we demonst 
rate the ability to systematical 
ly control sur- 
face crowding to investigate the effect on catalytic reactivity by
utilizing thiol modiﬁers that form monolay 
ers with varying sulfur 
coverage on Pd/Al 
2O3. CO DRIFT spectroscopy indicates that on the 
more crowded C18-coated catalysts, CO adsorbs only to threefold 
hollow and a single type of atop site at saturation coverage 
. On
AT-coated catalysts, CO initially adsorbs these same types of sites 
but has additional access to bridging and a second type of linear 
site upon increasing coverage. Using Langmuir formalism, a minor 
differenc 
e in adsorption energy (1.1 kJ/mol) was calculated for 
the AT- and C18-coated surfaces. An increase in ethylene hydroge- 
nation rate by a factor of 17 is then understood in terms of the 
additional access to atop sites which have been identiﬁed as the 
preferred site for this reaction. The effect of modiﬁer density on
reactivity was found to be dramatically different for several mono- 
and bi-functional reactants. These unique effects allow the possi- 
bility to exploit this techniqu 
e to control selectivity for other reac- 
tions in heterogeneous catalysis.
