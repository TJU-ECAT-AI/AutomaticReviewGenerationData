Descriptor-Based Analysis Applied to HCN Synthesis from NH3 and CH4†
Graphical Abstract
A trendy volcano: By the example of HCN synthesis from NH3 and CH4, it is demonstrated how scaling relations for intermediates and transition states provide a basis for the prediction of trends in heterogeneous catalysis (see logarithmic turnover frequency, TOF). These trends include not only the activity but also selectivity and the dominant reaction mechanism. This general approach can be applied to a large number of catalytic systems.
The design of solid metal catalysts by theoretical methods has been a long-standing goal in heterogeneous catalysis.1, 2 Recent developments in methodology and computer technology, as well as the establishment of a descriptor-based approach for the analysis of reaction mechanisms and trends across the periodic table, allow fast screening for new catalytic materials and have led to the first examples of computational discoveries of new materials.3–8 The underlying principles of the descriptor-based approach are the existence of relations between the surface electronic structure, adsorption energies, and activation barriers that result in volcano-shaped activity plots as a function of simple descriptors, such as atomic binding energies or the d-band center.1, 6, 9–17
Linear scaling relations have been established between the adsorption energies of hydrogen-containing molecules such as CHx, NHx, OHx, and SHx and the C, N, O, and S adsorption energies on transition-metal surfaces.18 Transition-state energies have also been shown to scale linearly with adsorption energies in a similar fashion.9, 16, 19, 20 Recently, a single transition-state scaling relation has been identified for a large number of C–C, C–O, C–N, N–O, N–N, and O–O coupling reactions.21 The scaling relations provide a powerful tool for the investigation of reaction mechanisms and the prediction of potential energy surfaces. They limit the number of independent variables to a few, typically adsorption energies of key atoms. Using this information as input to a microkinetic model provides an understanding of trends in catalytic activity. In most cases a volcano-shaped relation between activity and the key variables, the descriptors, is observed.16
Herein, we provide an example of the approach outlined above and show how one can obtain an understanding of activity/selectivity trends of a reaction with just a few new calculations. We take the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a versatile synthetic building block in organic chemistry, as an example.22 For the catalytic production of HCN from methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) there exist two main processes: the Andrussow and the Degussa (BMA) processes.23–25 Both of them use Pt gauze catalysts and are run at temperatures up to 1573 K. The main reason for the high reaction temperature is the endothermicity (ΔH°=251 kJ mol−1(HCN)) of the reaction CH4+NH3→HCN+3 H2, whereas the competing side reaction 2 NH3→N2+3 H2 is less endothermic (ΔH°=46 kJ mol−1(NH3)). Hence, NH3 decomposition is thermodynamically favored at low temperatures.
The industrially used Pt/Rh gauze catalysts reach their optimal activity only after an extended activation period under reaction conditions.23 SEM26 and STM27 characterization of the catalyst have shown that during this activation period the catalyst′s surface area is increased (roughening) and random faceting occurs. As an approximation of the active site on this surface, we use the stepped (211) facet, which has also been shown to dominate the catalytic activity in other reactions.28 Pt is the active catalytic component of the Pt/Rh catalyst, while the role of Rh is to increase the long-term stability.23
We consider the following elementary steps, including nine different routes for C–N coupling between CHx and NHy with x,y=0,1,2, where X* denotes an adsorbed species and * represents an empty surface site:
CH4(g)+2*
→ CH3*+H*
CH3*+*
→ CH2*+H*
CH2*+*
→ CH*+H*
CH*+*
→ C*+H*
NH3(g)+2*
→ NH2*+H*
NH2*+*
→ NH*+H*
NH*+*
→ N*+H*
CHx*+NHy*
→ CHxNHy*+*
CHxNHy*+ (x+y−1)*
→ HCN*+(x+y−1)H*
HCN*
→ HCN(g)+*
2 H*
→ H2(g)+2*
2 N*
→ N2(g)+2*
In the present case, we can model the energetics of all CHx and NHy species on transition-metal surfaces with the adsorption energies of carbon EC and nitrogen EN by using previously discovered scaling relations.18 Hydrogen adsorption is modeled with EC as previously reported.29 Thus, the stability of a large fraction of intermediates is given from the literature, and the only missing information is the adsorption energy of CHxNHy species. As we will show here, trends in the stability of CHxNHy intermediates can be obtained from the energies of the CHx and NHy constituents involved in the coupling reaction. Scaling of CHxNHy versus EC and EN can be found in Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
The dehydrogenation barriers for NH3 and CH4 decomposition follow scaling (or BEP) relations taken from Ref. 30. Similarly, activation barriers for the C–N and N–N coupling reactions have also been described recently in terms of scaling relations, which link the transition-state energy to the energy of the dissociated products.21 The dissociated products can then be linked to EC and EN through the scaling relations of adsorption energies of CHx and NHx intermediates. Assuming that the C–N coupling reactions are slow when compared to the subsequent hydrogen-exchange reaction of the CHxNHy backbone, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HCN synthesis process are described entirely by EC and EN, which leads to a tremendous simplification of the description.
In the following we use this descriptor-based meta-data to study trends in activity and selectivity of the HCN synthesis reaction by coupling it to a microkinetic model and analyze the results on the basis of volcano-shaped relations. For the parameterization of the microkinetic model we corrected the electronic energies obtained from the scaling relations with the zero-point energy EZPE, heat capacity contributions ΔU(T), and entropy, because the temperature range of interest for HCN synthesis is quite high. EZPE, ΔU, and S for each species and all transition states were calculated from the vibrational frequencies on Pt(211) at 1200 K and assumed to be constant. For gas-phase species we used the Shomate equation to estimate the temperature correction and entropy contributions to the Gibb’s free energy.31 Steady-state numerical solutions of the microkinetic model were obtained under representative reaction conditions for industrial HCN synthesis: P=1 atm, T=1373 K with the initial mole fractions 0.107, 0.093 and assuming a conversion level of 15 % with respect to CH4 and a selectivity of HCN/N2=2. Further details of the microkinetic model are given in section S2 of the Supporting Information.
By solving this comprehensive microkinetic model, which allows for multiple reaction pathways and the simultaneous production of HCN and N2, we obtain a volcano for the overall NH3 consumption as a function of EC and EN as displayed in Figure 1 a. The position of several (211) transition-metal surfaces is indicated along with 0.2 eV error bars for EC and EN. None of the transition-metal surfaces included here lies on the top of the volcano, but we find Co, Ir, and Ni closest to the top. Rh and Pt are also predicted to be active. Since NH3 adsorption leads to both HCN and N2, it is further important to consider the selectivity shown in Figure 1 b. Here we notice that Pt is unique in terms of its selectivity towards HCN production and is the only metal of those considered that produces only HCN.

To elucidate the competition between HCN and N2 formation further, we show the HCN and N2 formation volcanoes separately in Figure 2. Again, we find Co, Ir, and Ni as the most active materials for HCN formation, but at the same time they also produce significant amounts of N2 (note that the N2 volcano is one order of magnitude higher in activity). Pt, on the other hand, has a reasonably high activity for HCN synthesis and at the same time does not produce any N2. The comparison of the two volcanoes in Figure 2 clearly shows that any material close to the top of the HCN volcano also produces N2, which results in a low selectivity. The most interesting region for highly selective and active materials is at weaker EC and EN values relative to Pt. In this region the unique selectivity of Pt can be maintained and at the same time higher activities can be achieved.

The mechanism of HCN synthesis has been subjected to numerous studies, but an agreement on the dominant pathway under industrial conditions has not been achieved. Hasenberg and Schmidt studied HCN synthesis from NH3 and CH4 on Rh32 and Pt,33 and also in the presence of O2 on Pt34 at industrially relevant temperatures and low total pressures between 0.01 and 10 Torr. In the absence of O2 the reactive Rh and Pt surfaces are covered with almost one monolayer (1 ML) of carbon, which reacts with NHy fragments to give HCN. Multiple carbon layers deactivate the catalyst, which provides evidence for a metal-catalyzed reaction where the C–N coupling may occur between different CHx and NHy species under industrial conditions.32, 33 Evidence for a direct coupling of atomic C and N on the Pt(111) surface from NH3 and CH4 at approximately 500 K is provided by ultrahigh-vacuum studies using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection–absorption IR spectroscopy (RAIRS) on Pt(111).35, 36 Based on experiments in a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor on Pt black at 1173 K, Delagrange and Schuurman37 suggested an HCN synthesis reaction mechanism in which NH3 decomposition is the rate-limiting step and HCN is formed by a C–N or HC–N coupling reaction. However, the TAP experiments do not allow the exclusion of other CHx–NHy coupling mechanisms. A very detailed DFT study on Pt(111) suggests that the C–N coupling step in the Degussa process occurs between C or CH and NH2.38 Lastly, early coupling reactions of CHx with NHy on the catalyst surface and subsequent dehydrogenation as a homogeneous gas-phase reaction have also been discussed.39, 40
To answer the mechanistic question we inspected the surface coverages and rates of the various C–N coupling reactions. Figure 3 shows that the most abundant surface intermediate for all the investigated metals is carbon. On the very strong binding metals W, Mo, and Fe, the carbon coverage is 1 ML, whereas for all other metals θC<0.95 ML, which corresponds to the coverage on Pt. This result is in good agreement with the TPD and atomic-emission spectrometry (AES) measurements by Hasenberg and Schmidt.32, 33 The only other surface species that can be observed in notable quantities is N. High N coverages are predicted for very strong EN and weak EC but none of the metals studied herein falls into this region. High surface coverages can alter the stabilities of surface intermediates and transition states and usually lead to a destabilization through repulsive interactions. As has been shown for CO oxidation, one can estimate the effect of adsorbate–adsorbate interactions to a first approximation by moving the metal points to weaker binding energies.41 Across different transition-metal surfaces these interactions have a similar effect on the stability of surface intermediates and change the quantitative results, but the observed trends are expected to remain identical.

The individual rates of each possible CHx and NHy species are presented as a grid in Figure 4. The panels from left to right in the first row show the coupling rates of C with N, NH, and NH2, respectively. Similarly, the first column from top to bottom shows the coupling rates of N with C, CH, and CH2. Although it appears as if the direct C–N coupling mechanism is most active in a large region of the investigated parameter space, we note that for Pt the C–NH2 coupling mechanism is dominant and C–N coupling can be neglected. In contrast, the C–N coupling channel is very active on Rh for which we predict an HCN selectivity of less than 50 %. This may explain the high selectivity of Pt towards HCN: an early coupling of NHy species with surface carbon inhibits the formation of N atoms on the surface, which are necessary for the recombinative desorption as N2. Note that the blue regions in the C–N and HC–N coupling graphs indicate negative rates and correspond to CN bond scission. For materials in this region, NH3 decomposition to N2 is facilitated by adsorbed carbon with HCN as a reaction intermediate.

For Pt and Rh, the main components of the industrial catalyst, we also performed a rate-limiting step analysis using the degree of rate control XRC suggested by Campbell.42 On Pt the dissociative adsorption of NH3 is rate-limiting and CH4 adsorption has a negative impact on the HCN synthesis rate, thereby indicating a carbon poisoning situation. The adverse effect of very high θC is also reflected in the negative CH4 reaction order of −4.3 on Pt. On Rh significant N2 formation is observed and the mechanism here is more interesting. As on Pt, the adsorption of NH3 is overall the slowest step in the mechanism. The selectivity is governed by CH4 adsorption: fast CH4 adsorption favors the formation of HCN (positive XRC) while N2 formation is hindered (negative XRC). The XRC of N2 desorption is negative for both HCN and N2 formation, which is a counterintuitive result. The explanation for this can be given after a more detailed analysis of the changes in individual rates and coverages. Faster N2 desorption leads to lower , which causes a slower removal of carbon and increases θC. The net effect is a smaller fraction of empty sites and an additional decrease of the NH3 adsorption rate.
Our results agree well with the recent results by Gómez-Díaz and López38 and a number of observations reported for low-pressure HCN synthesis experiments by Hasenberg and Schmidt and the TAP reactor studies by Delagrange and Schuurman: 1) CH4 decomposition is fast, 2) the active Pt surface exhibits a high carbon coverage, 3) NH3 decomposition is inhibited by surface carbon, and 4) N2 and HCN formation have NH3 decomposition as the common rate-determining step. Neither of these experiments, however, can conclusively identify the main C–N coupling step and provide an explanation for the high HCN selectivity of Pt. Delagrange and Schuurman suggested C*+N*→CN* or CH*+N*→HCN* as the main routes, but explicitly included the possibility of NHy* reactions with C*. They argue that on Pt these two steps must be faster than N* recombination to N2 in order to explain the high selectivity of Pt. Hasenberg and Schmidt simply state that N* desorbs preferentially as HCN and not as N2 when CH4 is present. Our results clearly indicate that on Pt, the step C*+NH2*→CNH2* leads to the formation of HCN and limits the amount of N*, which is necessary for N2 desorption. Based on our results, we propose that the best HCN catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity can be found on the C–NH2 bond-formation volcano in the little peak area to the right of Pt in Figure 4 (top-right panel).
In summary, we have demonstrated the strength of scaling relations in a descriptor-based approach to determine the reaction mechanism and develop an activity/selectivity map for transition metals based on two parameters for a large-scale heterogeneously catalyzed process. From previously published scaling relations we found EC and EN as descriptors that allow the prediction of stabilities and barriers for almost all reaction intermediates and elementary steps in the reaction network. We used these relations in a comprehensive microkinetic model, without making any assumptions regarding the rate-determining step or surface coverages, and constructed volcanoes that not only predict the activity, but also address the issue of selectivity for a wide range of transition-metal surfaces. These volcanoes allow fast screening for new leads for materials with improved catalytic properties. Lastly, we identified the dominant reaction pathway for various possible C–N coupling reactions in this complex reaction network.
We propose the steps outlined above as a general strategy to identify promising transition-metal-based materials/alloys for a wide range of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. Using the existing universal scaling relations,18, 21, 30 the method allows the rapid discovery of promising candidates without the need for time-consuming/expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these universal relations have a relatively large error, we suggest the use of individual scaling lines for the reaction intermediates and transition states in question whenever possible. Since both scaling relations for intermediates and transition states also exist for other classes of materials,43 this approach can be applied widely and should not be limited to transition-metal surfaces.
Methods
DFT calculations for the surface-bound CHxNHy intermediates were carried out on the (211) surfaces of Ag, Cu, Pt, and Rh using Dacapo. The computational setup for these DFT calculations is identical to that in previous publications and all details are described in Ref. 21. The energies reported in this work are given with respect to gas-phase CH4, NH3, and H2.

Based on our results, we propose that the best HCN catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity can be found on the C–NH2 bond-formation volcano in the little peak area to the right of Pt in Figure 4 (top-right panel).
In summary, we have demonstrated the strength of scaling relations in a descriptor-based approach to determine the reaction mechanism and develop an activity/selectivity map for transition metals based on two parameters for a large-scale heterogeneously catalyzed process. From previously published scaling relations we found EC and EN as descriptors that allow the prediction of stabilities and barriers for almost all reaction intermediates and elementary steps in the reaction network. We used these relations in a comprehensive microkinetic model, without making any assumptions regarding the rate-determining step or surface coverages, and constructed volcanoes that not only predict the activity, but also address the issue of selectivity for a wide range of transition-metal surfaces. These volcanoes allow fast screening for new leads for materials with improved catalytic properties. Lastly, we identified the dominant reaction pathway for various possible C–N coupling reactions in this complex reaction network.
We propose the steps outlined above as a general strategy to identify promising transition-metal-based materials/alloys for a wide range of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions. Using the existing universal scaling relations,18, 21, 30 the method allows the rapid discovery of promising candidates without the need for time-consuming/expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these universal relations have a relatively large error, we suggest the use of individual scaling lines for the reaction intermediates and transition states in question whenever possible. Since both scaling relations for intermediates and transition states also exist for other classes of materials,43 this approach can be applied widely and should not be limited to transition-metal surfaces.
Methods
DFT calculations for the surface-bound CHxNHy intermediates were carried out on the (211) surfaces of Ag, Cu, Pt, and Rh using Dacapo. The computational setup for these DFT calculations is identical to that in previous publications and all details are described in Ref. 21. The energies reported in this work are given with respect to gas-phase CH4, NH3, and H2.
