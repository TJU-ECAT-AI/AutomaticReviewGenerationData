We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle Pd–Cu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for
selective hydrogenation reactions. Pd–Cu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom
alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation,
and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. Pd–Cu nanoparticles were prepared by addition of trace
amounts of Pd (0.18 atomic (at)%) to Cu nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 by galvanic replacement
(GR). The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenyl-
acetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydro-
gen (6.9 bar). The bimetallic Pd–Cu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for
phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining
a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion. Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is
observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with
the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible
spectroscopy measurements confirm the complete uptake and alloying of Pd with Cu by GR. Scanning tun-
neling microscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy of model SAA surfaces confirmed the feasibility of
hydrogen spillover onto an otherwise inert Cu surface. These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd
concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles.
Introduction
Selective hydrogenations of both double and triple carbon–
carbon bonds are important for a wide range of industrial
processes. Carbon–carbon bonds are among the most easily
hydrogenated functional groups, where ambient conditions
and low H2 pressures may be sufficient to perform these
reactions with the right catalyst. Given that molecular H2
dissociation is often the rate-limiting step, olefin hydrogenations
are typically performed over catalysts with a low barrier for H2
dissociation. Pd, Pt, Ni, and Ru are commonly employed for
hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes due to their high catalytic
activity. While these catalysts are highly active, they may not
always be selective to the desired product. Among these metals,
Pd is the most selective, but there is often a decrease in alkene
selectivity with alkyne conversion. Pd catalysts are commonly
used with a promoter to improve alkene selectivity; transition
metals such as Ag, Rh, Au, Cu, Zn, Cr, and V have been reported
to improve selectivity.1
The Pd–Cu system is of particular interest due to its use in a
variety of hydrogenation reactions.2–8 The hydrogenation of
phenylacetylene in the presence of styrene is among the most
heavily
studied
because
of
its
fundamental
importance.
Furthermore, doping of Pd catalysts with Cu has been shown
to improve selectivity for this reaction.2,4,5 Guczi2 examined the
effect of adding small amounts of Cu to Pd supported on
pumice for phenylacetylene hydrogenation, and attributed
increases in selectivity to either the electronic perturbation of
Pd by CuO, or an ensemble size variation when Cu was in its
metallic state. Mastalir and Kira
´ly4 found Pd supported on
hydrotalcite to be 100% selective for phenylacetylene hydro-
genation to styrene in the liquid phase at 298 K with H2
pressure on the order of 105 Pa. Bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts
have been used for the hydrogenation of a number of other
molecules including nitrates,3,6 aldehydes and molecules con-
taining both C

suggested that spillover of H from Pd kept Cu in a lower
oxidation state at which Cu was capable of nitrate reduction.
Both the electronic and geometric structure of bimetallic
alloys can have a large influence on their catalytic behavior.8
The role of Cu in promoting selective hydrogenations in Pd–Cu
systems depends heavily on the composition and nano-scale
structure of the alloy.8 Characterization of CuPd alloys by XPS
has shown that the binding energy of core level electrons in Cu
and Pd can be shifted higher or lower depending on the alloy
composition and thermal treatment; consequently, the electro-
nic state of both Cu and Pd are often debated.9–14 While XPS
results may imply that electronic perturbation has taken place,
binding energy shifts can also arise from initial and final state
effects;10,14 as such, supporting characterization is required to
determine the electronic structure of the elements in an alloy.
The electronic perturbation of Pd by Cu has been modeled
using DFT by Fernandez-Garcia et al. for Pd1Cu12 and Pd4Cu6
clusters, where charge transfer from Cu to Pd was found to
leave surface Pd atoms with a slight negative charge.15 Their
results were confirmed experimentally by studying PdCu nano-
particles supported on zeolites using X-ray absorption near
edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy.16 In contrast, several
studies have suggested that no electronic perturbation of Pd
by Cu occurred on PdCu bimetallic nanoparticles, and that only
geometric effects were present.17,18 For instance, Skoda et al.17
studied PdCu/Al2O3 using CO-FTIR and reported that no elec-
tron transfer was observed between Cu and Pd; rather, dilution
of the surface Pd atoms by Cu led to a decrease in activity for
toluene hydrogenation. Sykes and co-workers measured the
geometric and electronic structure of Pd/Cu(111) surface alloys
using scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning
tunneling spectroscopy (STS).19,20 The STS spectra revealed that
isolated Pd atoms in the Cu(111) surface carried a slightly
positive charge due to a localized depletion of electron density
that arises from surface state electron scattering from the
Pd atoms.
The complex interplay between the bimetallic alloy structure
and the catalytic performance of Pd–Cu alloys, or structure–
function relationships, can be better understood in well
defined systems such as single crystal surfaces in ultra-high
vacuum (UHV). In effect, these surface science studies may
provide a strategy for preparing heterogeneous bimetallic cat-
alysts for hydrogenation reactions at near ambient conditions.
We have recently reported the unexpected ability of Cu(111)
surfaces to facilitate selective hydrogenation reactions by virtue
of atomic hydrogen spillover from isolated Pd atoms added by
physical vapor deposition.21 Individual, isolated Pd atoms in
the Cu(111) surface, termed single atom alloys (SAAs), act as
sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the otherwise
inert Cu surface.20–22 The weak binding of intermediates
offered by Cu(111) led to the selective hydrogenation of both
styrene and acetylene, as demonstrated by STM and temper-
ature programmed desorption and reaction (TPD/R) spectro-
scopy studied under UHV conditions.21
Here, we report for the first time the application of the SAA
strategy to preparing heterogeneous Pd–Cu alloy nanoparticles
for selective hydrogenation catalysis. Nanoparticle catalysts
were prepared by depositing small amounts of Pd exclusively
onto the surface of pre-formed Cu nanoparticles by the galvanic
replacement (GR) reaction. Characterization of the resulting
bimetallic catalysts by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
and UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) analyses, along with cata-
lytic activity measurements for the partial hydrogenation of
phenylacetylene are described in the present study. The catalytic
performance of bimetallic catalysts was compared to mono-
metallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading. Model catalytic
studies were applied to guide the design of the nanoparticle
catalysts. High resolution STM imaging and thermal desorption
spectroscopy were used to determine a range of Pd concentra-
tions in and on Cu(111) for which hydrogen spillover is feasible,
while avoiding the formation of large Pd ensembles that lead to
poor selectivity.
Experimental
H2-TPD on Pd/Cu(111) surfaces
The hydrogen uptake experiments were performed in an
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of
1  1010 mbar. The chamber incorporates a quadrupole mass
spectrometer to perform temperature programmed desorption
(TPD) measurements, as well as a system for low energy
electron diﬀraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES). For each hydrogen dose, the chamber was backfilled with
hydrogen 99.999% (Airgas) to the necessary pressure for a time
corresponding to a 100 Langmuir (L) exposure (1 L = 1 
106 Torr s). The 1 ML coverage of hydrogen was calculated
based on a saturation coverage of hydrogen deposited on the
5 ML Pd film, assuming the film terminates as Pd(111).
Hydrogen desorption was monitored using a heating rate of
1 K s1. In order to deposit very small amounts of Pd in a
reproducible manner, Omicron Nanotechnology Focus EFM 3
electron beam evaporators with internal flux monitors were
used. Pd coverages were calibrated using both AES and carbon
monoxide 99.99% (Airgas) titration. Pd was deposited at 380 K,
at which low coverages of Pd alloys into the surface layer of
Cu(111) in the form of individual, isolated atoms.20,22
STM of Pd/Cu(111) surfaces
STM images were acquired at 29 K with an Omicron Nano-
Technology variable-temperature scanning tunneling micro-
scope housed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. A Cu(111)
single crystal from Monocrystals Co. was prepared in a pre-
paration chamber by Ar+ sputtering (1.5 keV, 25 mA) and
annealing (1000 K) cycles. Pd was deposited onto the surface
by resistively heating a Pd wrapped W wire for diﬀerent lengths
of time while the surface was held at 380 K. Once the deposition
was complete, the sample was transferred in vacuum to the
microscope chamber where it was placed into the LHe-cooled
STM stage in o10 min. The microscope chamber operated at a
base pressure of o5  1011 mbar to ensure sample cleanliness.
Scanning conditions for Pd on Cu(111) were voltages between
0.1 V and 0.1 V and currents o2.1 nA. All biases refer to the

Bruker etched W tips.
Materials
Palladium nitrate hydrate (Pd(NO3)2xH2O, 99.9% metals basis,
Alfa Aesar), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)23H2O, Johnson
Matthey) were used as the metal precursors. Active metals were
supported on aluminum oxide (g-Al2O3, ultra-pure grade
99.99%, Inframat Advanced Materials). Metal colloids were
encapsulated using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, MW = 40 000–
80 000, Alfa Aesar) as a capping agent. Metal precursors were
reduced with sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-Aldrich).
Oxidation of copper in solution was prevented by addition of
L-ascorbic acid (C6H8O6 reagent grade, Sigma Aldrich). All
reactions were performed in a n-hexane (CH3(CH2)4CH3 anhy-
drous, 95%, Sigma Aldrich) solvent with phenylacetylene
(C6H5CCH, 98%, Sigma Aldrich) as the reactants. All the
chemicals were used as-received.
Nanoparticle catalyst preparation
Preparation of nanoparticles followed procedures developed by
the Somorjai group23 and Chunwei et al.,24 with slight mod-
ifications. Under nitrogen protection, an aqueous solution of
0.01 M Cu(NO3)2 was mixed with PVP (MW 40 000) at a 200 : 1
molar ratio of Cu : PVP (1 : 1 wt/wt) and the desired amount of a
0.1 M solution of ascorbic acid to prevent the oxidation of Cu
nanoparticles. After mixing, the solution turned from a light
blue color to a light red color. An aqueous solution of 0.1 M
NaBH4 was added dropwise to achieve a 2 : 1 molar ratio of
Na : Cu; upon addition of NaBH4 the solution turned from a
transparent light red to an opaque brown suspension. To this
solution, 1 g of alumina powder (g-Al2O3, ultra-pure grade
99.99%, Inframat Advanced Materials) was added under con-
stant stirring for 30 min before it was filtered and washed with
500 cc of D.I. water and dried in vacuum for 12 h. Dried
materials were calcined in air to 300 1C for at 5 1C min1 and
held for 4 h to remove any PVP capping agent from the Cu
nanoparticles.
Addition of Pd by galvanic replacement (GR)
Addition of Pd exclusively to Cu nanoparticles was carried out
by GR. GR oﬀers a simple route for metal exchange where the
metal host acts as a template for the minority metal precursor.25
Based on the reduction potential of the precursor relative to the
metal host, the process may or may not be thermodynamically
favorable. In the case of Cu which has a lower reduction
potential (Cu2+/Cu, E0 = +0.340 V) than Pd (Pd2+/Pd, E0 =
+0.915 V) it is favorable for Pd(II) precursors to be reduced by
the Cu host metal via the following displacement reaction:
Cu + Pd2+ - Cu2+ + Pd (DE 0 = +0.575 V)
Furthermore, it has been shown that the reduction of Pd2+
and Pt2+ by Cu can be facilitated by high-intensity ultrasound,
using a sonicator.26,27 The procedure for the GR reaction followed
one reported by Muhler and co-workers.26 Copper nanoparticles
supported on alumina (Cu/Al2O3) were reduced in hydrogen to
250 1C at a rate of 5 1C min1 to ensure that copper was in its
metallic state. After reduction, the Cu/Al2O3 was transferred to
an aqueous solution under nitrogen protection and constant
stirring. The desired amount of Pd(NO3)2 was added to the
solution. A sonicating tip was immersed in the suspension, where
sonication was provided to enhance the rate of the GR reaction.
After 15 min, the resulting material was filtered, washed with
500 cc of D.I. water, and dried in vacuum for 12 h.
Preparation of monometallic Pd by incipient wetness
impregnation (IWI)
Monometallic Pd catalysts were prepared by IWI.28 Briefly, the
desired amount of Pd(NO3)2 was dissolved in an aqueous
solution equivalent to the pore volume of the Al2O3 support.
The resulting paste was dried under vacuum for 12 h and
calcined at 300 1C for 4 h.
Catalyst characterization
Catalyst samples were characterized by HRTEM, XPS, UV-Vis
and XRD, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), CO
chemisorption, and nitrogen desorption porosimetry for BET
surface area measurements. HRTEM samples were prepared by
sonicating a catalyst suspension in ethanol, and depositing a
drop of the suspension onto a carbon-coated, copper grid.
HRTEM was performed at the Harvard Center for Nanoscale
Systems on a JEOL 2100 electron microscope operated with a
lanthanum hexaboride source at 200 kV. XPS samples were
prepared by adhesion of dried powder samples to copper tape
supported by a carbon backing. XPS was performed at the
Harvard Center for Nanoscale Systems on a Thermo Scientific
K-Alpha system equipped with an Al source and 1801 double
focusing hemispherical analyzer and 128-channel detector.
High resolution XPS spectra were obtained at a pass energy of
40 eV. XRD was performed on a Rigaku RU300 Cr-source
powder diﬀractometer. Cr radiation was used with a power
setting of 50 kV and 250 mA. A scan rate of 1 degree per min
with a 0.02 degree step size was used. BET surface area, CO
chemisorption, and H2-temperature programmed reduction
measurements were conducted using a Micromeritics Auto-
Chem 2920 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). The BET surface area was determined by single-point
N2 adsorption–desorption cycles. Samples were pretreated in
100% He to 250 1C at a rate of 10 1C min1 and held for 30 min
to remove any adsorbed species. CO chemisorption measure-
ments were conducted by pulsing 10% CO in He over the
sample until the discretely injected gas volumes were deter-
mined unchanged by the TCD. The difference in total amount
of CO injected and the amount measured in the gas effluent
were used to calculate dispersion of the active metal based on
the respective stoichiometry factors. All samples were pre-
reduced in 20% H2/Ar to 250 1C at a rate of 10 1C min1, held
for 2 h, and cooled in He to room temperature. H2-temperature
programmed reduction measurements were carried out by
exposing the sample to a 50 cc min1 of 20% H2/Ar while
ramping the temperature linearly and monitoring with TCD.

All samples were pretreated in 20% O2/He to 300 1C at a rate of
10 1C min1, to oxidize the active metal species on the surface.
UV-Vis measurements were carried out in Evolutiont 300

Catalytic activity measurements
Reactions were carried out in a 50 cc liquid Parr reactor.
Supported samples were pretreated in the Parr reactor under
H2 flow to 250 1C for 1 h at a ramping rate of 5 1C min1 in
order to ensure that they were fully reduced. De-aerated phenyl-
acetylene in n-hexane was injected into the Parr reactor while
hydrogen was flowing. The reactor was pressurized to 100 psi
under 100% H2 while the reactants and catalyst were stirred
continuously. Liquid samples were drawn from the reactor and
filtered ex situ so that the reactant : catalyst ratio remained
constant during the experiment. Samples were analyzed in a
gas chromatograph (GC) (HP 5890) equipped with a flame
ionization detector (FID) for phenylacetylene, styrene, ethyl
benzene, and ethyl cyclohexane detection. The GC column used
was a 30 m Restek Rxi-5ms (diphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane)
with a 0.25 mm ID and 1.00 mm df (film thickness).
Results and discussion
H2-TPD and STM of Pd/Cu(111) surfaces
H2 thermal desorption spectra were taken for a range of Pd
concentrations deposited on the Cu(111) surface at 380 K as
described in the experimental section. We have previously
shown that the Cu(111) surface is inactive towards hydrogen
dissociation and uptake, and that small amounts of Pd alloy
into the surface layer of Cu(111) as individual, isolated atoms
that can act as entry and exit sites for hydrogen dissociation
and recombination, respectively.20–22,29 In the present work a
range of Pd coverages (0.01–5 ML) alloyed into/on the surface
layer of Cu(111) were studied. It was determined that in the
single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak
is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd
coverage increases, due to surface strain.21 At Pd coverages
>0.3 ML H2 desorption took place over a range of temperatures
from 160 K up to 300 K, the upper limit of which is character-
istic of desorption from bulk Pd(111). Fig. 1 shows the corre-
sponding H2-TPD profiles after exposing the aforementioned
surfaces to 100 L of H2 at 85 K. The H2-TPD profiles clearly show
that at Pd concentrations below 0.1 ML H2 desorbs from a
single site, which is indicated by a single desorption peak.
These results are important when considering the use of Pd as a
site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover of H atoms
onto an otherwise inert Cu surface. The objective is to prepare a
catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for
hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area
on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place. In
addition, exclusively isolated atoms of Pd must be present to
avoid complete hydrogenation or decomposition of the reac-
tants by larger Pd ensembles.21 Fig. 2 shows a plot of hydrogen
uptake as a function of Pd coverage calculated from the H2-TPD
data presented in Fig. 1. The theoretical line in Fig. 2 assumes
that hydrogen uptake increases linearly with Pd coverage.
The main plot in Fig. 2 shows that H saturation is not
reached until >2 ML of Pd is deposited on Cu(111). This is due
to second layer island formation before the first layer is
complete as seen in the STM images in Fig. 3. While at a glance
H uptake appears to be linear with Pd coverage, at o1 ML Pd
coverages, inspection of the inset in Fig. 2 indicates that at low
Pd coverage the H uptake is higher than the amount of Pd in
the surface. This provides strong evidence for H atom spillover
onto the Cu(111) surface as under these conditions Cu(111) is
completely inactive for H2 activation. An increase in hydrogen
uptake with increasing Pd concentration is due to an increased
number of entry sites for hydrogen dissociation and spillover
onto Cu(111). Similar systems have been previously investi-
gated. Goodman and Yates30–32 showed that addition of a thin
film of Cu to a Ru(0001) surface inhibited the uptake of H2, and
even when Cu covered a fraction of the surface there was still a
decrease in H2 uptake. They further showed that when the
temperature was raised, H2 uptake on the bimetallic CuRu
surface increased, which was attributed to dissociation and

spillover from Ru to Cu.30–32 Similar conclusions regarding
hydrogen spillover onto Cu have been proposed by Crucq
et al.33 for CuNi alloys and Rodriguez et al.34 for Cu covered
Re single crystals. The important difference in this work is that
the active metal (Pd) is the minority component, and only
individual, isolated atoms are needed to promote hydrogen
uptake dissociation and spillover.
Fig. 3 depicts STM images of a range of Pd coverages on
Cu(111). At low Pd coverages, Pd is present in the form of
individual, isolated atoms substituted into the Cu surface layer
as can be seen in Fig. 3A. The larger scale image in Fig. 3B
shows that the alloying site is the ascending step edges. Only at
Pd coverages B0.5 ML and greater are Pd islands observed on
the surface as seen in Fig. 3C and D. It is obvious from these
images that second and third layers grow before the first Pd ML
is complete. These complex alloy surface structures, which
consist of a mix of isolated Pd atoms, larger ensembles and
continuous Pd islands lead to the broad H2 desorption features
observed in Fig. 1.
When considering the application of the SAA strategy to
preparing PdCu alloy nanoparticles the most important para-
meter is the concentration of the Pd relative to the host Cu
surface, and the ability to disperse the Pd. While the former is
easily controllable, the method by which alloy formation takes
place should closely resemble the mechanism observed by
physical vapor deposition of Pd on the Cu(111) surface. Work
by Sykes and co-workers35 has shown that Pd atoms diﬀuse to
Cu step edges where they alloy into the Cu surface by place
exchange. The strategy for translating the architecture of this
model system to nanoparticles is to add low concentrations of
Pd to Cu nanoparticles utilizing a method by which Cu atoms
are exchanged with Pd atoms.
Characterization of heterogeneous bimetallic alloy catalysts
Table 1 lists the various Cu, Pd, and PdCu nanoparticles
prepared and tested in this work.
Cu nanoparticles were prepared in the absence of a support
to avoid any electrostatic interactions between the organo-
metallic precursor and the support.28 As prepared Cu@PVP
colloids were subsequently deposited on the Al2O3 support and
calcined in air to 300 1C to remove any PVP surfactant as
described in the experimental section. Fig. 4 contains TEM
images of the as prepared Cu nanoparticles (Cu@PVP) and Cu
nanoparticles deposited on the Al2O3 support at a loading of
15 at% (Cu15/Al2O3). Fig. 4A shows a TEM image of Cu@PVP
nanoparticles taken directly from the preparation suspension
and deposited onto the TEM grid. The particles were measured
to be approximately 4.1  0.8 nm with a narrow size distribu-
tion, as shown in the Fig. 4A inset. Lattice resolved images of
the nanoparticles present in Fig. 4A are shown in Fig. 4B and C
where the lattice spacing (d = 0.21 nm) corresponds to the
interplanar spacing of the Cu(111) surface.36 Fig. 4D and E
depict the equivalent image of Cu15/Al2O3. Due to the low
z-contrast of Cu, atomically resolved images were not obtained
for supported Cu nanoparticles. The outline of nanoparticles in
Fig. 4E is provided to help distinguish Cu and Al2O3 particles.
The supported Cu nanoparticles were approximately 5.1 
1.2 nm with a narrow size distribution, as shown in Fig. 4F.
Thus, almost no change in the copper particle size occurred
after the immobilization/drying step. The oxidation state of the
Cu nanoparticles was also considered, as Cu must be in the
metallic state for GR to take place.
Fig. 5 shows the H2-TPR of Cu15/Al2O3 along with XRD
spectra obtained before and after reducing the catalyst in
hydrogen. It is clear from Fig. 5A that reduction of CuO peaked

at 180 1C. Since the Cu(NO3)2 precursor was completely reduced
with excess NaBH4, as described in the experimental section,
the reduction feature was due to the CuO phase. Bulk CuO
nanoparticles are known to reduce above B200 1C;37 based on
the reduction peak temperature in Fig. 5A it is not expected that
bulk CuO nanoparticles were formed. By integrating the hydro-
gen peak in Fig. 5A it is estimated that approximately 39% of
the copper is present as CuO. The XRD data shown in Fig. 5B
confirm that after mild hydrogen treatment Cu nanoparticles
are in the metallic state. Furthermore, no bulk CuO phase was
present in the pre-reduced sample after storage for several days
in vacuum and followed by a very short exposure to air during
transition to the XRD instrument. Fig. 5C demonstrates that
the peaks at 2y = 53.2 and 53.6 correspond to Al2O3 and CuO,
respectively, and are distinguishable by the XRD spectra. Addi-
tionally, based on the XRD analysis, some sintering of the
copper nanoparticles had taken place during the thermal
treatment in air to 300 1C to remove the PVP. Using the Scherrer

equation, an average particle size of approximately 13 nm was
calculated from the diﬀractograms in Fig. 5C for the CuO
nanoparticles. Further evidence of sintering was determined
by CO chemisorption measurements that estimate a Cu disper-
sion of 6.5% corresponding to a nanoparticle size of 15 nm;
these calculations assumed a stoichiometry of CO : Cu = 1.0.
While the size of the copper particles more than doubled as a
result of the calcination step, they were still small enough to
test for reactivity after deposition of Pd by GR.
Pd was added to the surface of Cu nanoparticles by GR after
pre-reduction of Cu15/Al2O3 catalysts in hydrogen at 250 1C as
described in the experimental section. Fig. 6A contains UV-Vis
spectroscopy analysis of the filtrate solution after GR of 0.18
at% Pd on Cu15/Al2O3 (Cu : Pd 83 : 1 at/at) compared with
solutions of the metallic precursor standards. Fig. 6B and C
shows XPS data of the resulting Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst after
filtration compared to a monometallic Pd catalyst of the same
Pd concentration (0.18 at%) prepared by IWI (Pd0.18/Al2O3).
The UV-Vis presented in Fig. 6A demonstrates that complete
uptake of Pd took place during GR. Clear distinction between the
Pd2+ and Cu2+ precursor was observed, where the wash solution
after GR matched closely with the Cu2+ standard. The presence
of Cu2+ in solution is typically characterized by a broad absorp-
tion peak in the 600–900 nm range38 as observed by Muhler and
co-workers26 in the GR filtrate after displacement of Cu with Pt.
When 0.18 at% Pd was added to Cu15/Al2O3 by GR the absorption
band was not observed; this was most likely due to the very low
concentration of Cu2+ resulting from the exchange of small
amounts of Pd. To ensure that the preparation method was
adequate for this system, a larger amount of Pd(NO3)2, corre-
sponding to approximately 1.8 at% Pd, was added to Cu15/Al2O3
by GR; in this case the absorption band was observed in solution
and is shown in the Fig. 6A inset. An important difference
between the work reported by Muhler and co-workers26 and
the present work is the relative ratios of Cu: Pd (compared with
Cu: Pt). As our active metal concentrations were much lower,
they may have been harder to detect in the filtrate by UV-Vis.
Additionally, Cu2+ in the solution may have re-adsorbed onto the
support surface; this is supported by a lower intensity in the Cu2+
absorption band from the GR filtrate compared ot the Cu2+
standard (Fig. 6A inset) even though complete uptake of Pd took
place. Finally, when Pd(NO3)2 was sonicated in the presence of
bare Al2O3 no uptake of Pd occured.
The XPS results shown in Fig. 6B indicate that alloying took
place. The Pd 3d spectra for the monometallic Pd0.18/Al2O3
prepared by IWI show characteristic doublet peaks corre-
sponding to Pd0 (Pd 3d5/2 at 334.9 eV),2,18 while the bimetallic
Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 was shifted to higher binding energies (Pd 3d5/2
at 335.6 eV). The observed energy shift compares very well to that
reported by Guczi2 for Cu0.05Pd1.5 and Cu0.05Pd0.6 nanoparticles
supported on pumice after hydrogen treatment at 298 K (Pd 3d5/2
at 335.6 eV); however, after hydrogen treatment to 623 K they
observe a shift to a Pd 3d binding energy of 334.8 eV. This was
explained by interaction with the pumice support upon the
reduction of CuO; prior to reduction, Pd was thought to be
slightly oxidized by CuO. Similarly, Batista et al.39 demonstrated,
by characterization with XPS, that Pd was in its metallic state
when alloyed with Cu on alumina. In our case CuO is reduced
prior to GR in order for the exchange of Pd with Cu atoms to be
favorable. It is feasible, however, that after GR, oxidation of Cu
on the surface of Pd0.18Cu15Al2O3 took place from exposure to air
before the sample was prepared for XPS measurements; as such,
the oxidation of Pd by CuO would cause a shift to slightly higher
binding energies. This hypothesis is supported by the Cu 2p XPS
data shown in Fig. 6C which shows that approximately 40%
of the Cu measured by XPS was present as CuO while the
remaining 60% was metallic Cu (Cu 2p3/2 at 932.7 eV); this was
calculated by deconvolution of the Cu 2p3/2 peak, considering
that the ratio of the satellite peak (943.3 eV) to the CuO
contribution (934.6 eV) from the Cu 2p3/2 peak should be 0.4.40
The relative amount of CuO measured by XPS corresponds to a
surface oxide for a 13 nm Cu nanoparticle.41,42 These results are
in agreement with those reported by Guczi et al.18 for PdCu/Al2O3
and by Strohmeier et al.40 for Cu/Al2O3. The presence of surface
CuO confirms that the binding energy shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak
for Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shown in Fig. 6B is due to partial oxidation
of Pd by CuO;2,18 more importantly, this demonstrates that Pd is
alloyed with Cu.
Using the XPS measurements in Fig. 6B and C the concen-
trations of Cu and Pd on the surface of Pd0.18Cu15Al2O3 were
calculated to be 9.1 at% and 0.45 at%, respectivley, giving an
atomic ratio of 20 : 1 (Cu: Pd) on the surface of each nanoparticle.

Based on UV-vis measurments presented in Fig. 5A, which
confirm the complete uptake of Pd, the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd
in each nanoparticle (based on total metal loading) is 83 : 1.
While XPS spectroscopy is a surface technique, the signal can
be representative of several atomic layers beneath the surface.41–43
At the binding energy for Cu 2p3/2, the escape distance (l),
corresponding to the inelastic mean free path of an electron from
Cu, is approximately 1 nm.41,42 For a 13 nm Cu nanoparticle
(approximately 8% dispersion), using simple geometry one can
predict that about 30% of the Cu atoms exist within 1 nm of the
surface.43 Based on this assumption, if all of the Pd was present
on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and detected by XPS, an
atomic ratio of Cu :Pd of 25 :1 would be expected. The calculated
atomic ratios are slightly higher than measured by XPS (20 :1),
which is most likely due to a combination of uncertainties. For
instance, these calculations are subject to any error in estimating
the Cu nanoparticle size. Nevertheless, based on the proximity of
the theoretical and experimental atomic ratios of Cu: Pd, and the
nature of Pd uptake by GR, it is expected that Pd exists predomi-
nantly on the surface of Cu nanoparticles and is well dispersed.
It is worth mentioning that CuAl2O4 can be formed upon
heat treatment of Cu or Cu2+ precursors on Al2O3 supports.
While it is diﬃcult to distinguish spinel phases of Al2O3 from
CuAl2O4 by XRD40 and CuO from CuAl2O4 by XPS,40 it is not
expected that any significant amount of CuAl2O4 was present in
the samples being reported. This is supported by the high-
temperature conditions necessary for formation of CuAl2O4
44 as
well as the high concentration of metallic Cu measured by XRD
and XPS in the samples being reported here.
Activity measurements for hydrogenation over Pd–Cu catalysts
The samples listed in Table 1 were tested for their catalytic
activity and selectivity in phenylacetylene hydrogenation. It
should be noted that all samples were reduced in hydrogen to
250 1C, in situ, prior to catalytic activity tests, and it is expected
that both Cu and Pd were in their metallic state. Fig. 7 below
shows time resolved batch reactor data at 25 1C and 100 psi H2
comparing Pd0.18/Al2O3 prepared by IWI to Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3
prepared by GR.
Fig. 7 demonstrates that Pd0.18/Al2O3 catalyst has very
poor selectivity to styrene as the product distribution consists
completely of ethyl benzene when the reaction reaches 100%
conversion. However, Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 has a styrene selectivity
of approximately 94% when the reaction reaches 90% conver-
sion; conversely, Pd0.18/Al2O3 has a selectivity of 62% at the same
conversion. Hence, a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3
catalyst, containing only trace amounts of Pd, is demonstrated.
Additionally, the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst was left under reac-
tion conditions for over 24 h after conversion had reached 90%,
and maintained high selectivity to styrene (>90%). Fig. 8 com-
pares the initial reaction rates normalized by the total Pd loading
(for Pd containing samples) as well as a comparison of the initial
rate of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 and Cu15/Al2O3 normalized by the total
Cu loading.
It is clear from Fig. 8 that a marked improvement in
reactivity of Cu15/Al2O3 for phenylacetylene hydrogenation is
observed with the addition of small amounts of Pd to the Cu
nanoparticles. Catalysts with low Pd loadings (Pd0.18/Al2O3)
show higher selectivity to styrene than catalysts with higher
loadings (Pd4.8/Al2O3), mostly likely due to a higher disper-
sion.45 Nevertheless, the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 shows significantly
higher selectivity to styrene than either monometallic catalyst
at comparative conversions. The initial rates per gram of Pd
shown in Fig. 8A are comparable to previous reports for highly
dispersed Pd catalysts.46–48 The bimetallic Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 had
a lower initial rate per gram of Pd than either monometallic
catalyst. A similar loss in activity was observed by Guczi2 for
Cu0.025Pd1.5 and Cu0.025Pd0.6 compared with the monometallic
Pd catalysts; this decrease in activity was attributed to the
dilution of Pd by Cu, while increased selectivity was thought
to be a result of ensemble size variation. In our case Pd is the
minority metal, and based on model catalyst studies, is
expected to act as a site for hydrogen uptake, dissociation,
and spillover onto the Cu host, where selective hydrogenation
can take place. Consequently, a lower rate of phenylacetylene
hydrogenation is anticipated compared to a catalyst where
hydrogenation takes place predominately on Pd.
It should be noted that improvements in selectivity for
phenylacetylene hydrogenation have been previously reported,
resulting from and not limited to the use of diﬀerent catalyst
supports,49–51 bimetallic catalysts,2,4,5,52 and organometallic
precursors.53,54 Unlike most previous investigations, our results

demonstrate that a very low amount of active metal (Pd) within
the bimetallic catalyst can activate an otherwise inactive Cu
nanoparticle for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. In
addition, model catalytic studies have guided the development
of the PdCu nanoparticle catalysts, and demonstrated the
feasibility of hydrogen spillover on such materials. Similar
activation of Ru and Au by Pt has been observed for phenyla-
cetylene hydrogenation52 and nitrochlorobenzene hydrogena-
tion,55 respectively.
Conclusions
The relationship between the geometric and electronic struc-
ture of bimetallic alloys and their catalytic behavior is of
particular interest for selective hydrogenation reactions. The
SAA strategy stemming from model catalytic studies was used
in this work to prepare PdCu alloy nanoparticles where trace
amounts of Pd (0.18 at%) were deposited exclusively onto the
surface of Cu nanoparticles by GR. Using UV-vis spectroscopy
and XPS we demonstrate that complete uptake of Pd took place
by GR, and that Pd exists on the surface of Cu nanoparticles.
This catalyst shows a marked improvement in the selectivity to
styrene when compared to the same amount of Pd on Al2O3,
while preserving a high rate of phenylacetylene hydrogenation.
Additional model catalytic studies were applied to guide the
design of the nanoparticle catalysts. High resolution STM
imaging and TPD spectroscopy showed that hydrogen spillover
to the Cu surface took place at a range of Pd concentrations
(0.01 to >0.5 ML), and primarily isolated Pd atoms existed at
concentrations of o0.1 ML. Based on a combination of surface
science studies and heterogeneous catalyst performance mea-
sured at near ambient conditions, we propose that the high
selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on
the Cu surface. Whereas small amounts of Cu are typically
added as a promoter to Pd catalysts, we show here that Cu can
be used as a catalyst for selective hydrogenations with the
addition of trace amounts of a precious metal with a low barrier
for hydrogen dissociation. The cooperative use of surface
science and heterogeneous catalysis techniques in this study
has broader impacts for bridging the gap between these fields.
