Abstract
Finding the solids that are the best catalysts for a given reaction is a daunting task due to the large number of combinations and structures of
multicomponent surfaces. In addition, it is not only the reaction rate that needs to be optimized; the selectivity, durability, and cost must also be
taken into account. Here we propose a computational screening approach and apply it to design a new metal alloy catalyst for the methanation
reaction (CO + 3H2 →CH4 + H2O).

1. Introduction
It has been shown that the kinetics of full catalytic reac-
tions can be described semiquantitatively on the basis of ther-
mochemistry and activation energies calculated using density
functional theory (DFT) [1–3]. If such an approach could be ex-
tended from a single catalyst to a range of catalysts, then DFT
calculations could be used for a ﬁrst screening of new catalysts.
Although this is not yet possible, we take a step in that direction
with the following procedure. First, we establish a correlation
between the catalytic activity and a descriptor, which we can
calculate directly using DFT. The descriptor is chosen on the
basis of a general understanding of parameters determining the
variation in catalytic activity from one catalyst to the next [4,5].
We use experimental data for the activity of a set of elemental
metals to determine the optimum value of the descriptor. Next,

we perform a preliminary screening of a number of intermetal-
lic alloys based on a model of the effect of alloying developed
from DFT calculations. Then we study the most interesting al-
loys using full DFT calculations to verify the alloy model and
make deﬁnite predictions of the activity. Finally, we synthesize
the best catalyst candidates and measure their catalytic activi-
ty.
To illustrate this approach, we use the methanation reac-
tion (CO + 3H2 →CH4 + H2O). This is one of the classic
reactions in heterogeneous catalysis [6–9] used in connection
with, for instance, catalytic ammonia synthesis (N2 + 3H2 →
2NH3) to remove trace amounts of CO from the hydrogen
feed gas. It has attracted renewed interest for the clean up
of reformate hydrogen fuels for low-temperature fuel cells
in which CO is a strong poison [10]. The traditional metha-
nation catalyst is Ni supported on Al2O3 [9]. The reaction
is well described experimentally [11,12] and theoretically [5,
13,14], and recently experimental high-throughput screening
methods have been applied to ﬁnd new catalysts for this reac-
tion [15].

2. Methods
2.1. Computational details
2.1.1. Electronic structure calculations
The electronic structure calculations are carried out using
DFT calculations [16,17] in a plane wave pseudopotential im-
plementation [18,19]. Ultra-soft pseudopotentials [20] are used
to represent the ionic cores, allowing for a reasonable treatment
of ﬁrst-row atoms and transition metals even with a relatively
limited plane wave basis. The plane wave cutoff in the calcula-
tions is 25 Rydberg for the wave functions and 50 Rydberg for
the electron densities, except for Co, for which the plane wave
cutoff is 35 Rydberg and the density cutoff 70 Rydberg. For Fe,
Co, and Ni, the calculations are spin-polarized. The calculations
are performed using the RPBE exchange correlation [21] on pe-
riodically repeated stepped fcc(211) metal slabs with 12 layers
in the [211] direction. This corresponds to 4 close-packed lay-
ers and gives 24 atoms in the unit cell. This particular choice of
model allows us to retain the correct bulk composition and pe-
riodic structure for the ordered binary 1:3 and 1:1 alloys (such
as FeNi3 and FeNi), as well as for the regular fcc structures.
In all cases, the uppermost close-packed layer (3 [211]-layers)
is fully relaxed together with the adsorbed species. The lattice
constants are chosen as the calculated bulk lattice constant for
the respective metals in their ground state structure using the
RPBE functional. There is at least 10 Å of vacuum between the
slabs, and the dipole interaction between the periodically re-
peated slabs is decoupled by introducing a dipole layer in the
vacuum between the slabs. A k-point sampling of 4 × 4 × 1
Monkhorst–Pack k-points [22] is chosen.
The calculations are performed with one adsorbate per unit
cell, that is, a surface coverage of 1/6 monolayers, or equiv-
alently a step coverage of 0.5. All transition states (TS) are
found using a constrained bond optimization technique, which
for both Ni(211) and Ru(211) is found to give the same energy
as the more rigorous nudged elastic band method [23].
2.1.2. Oxygen–surface alloy binding energies
The raw data for the oxygen binding energy (BEO) on bi-
nary surface alloys, along with the computational details, have
been provided previously [24]. The alloys are constructed by al-
lowing incorporation of various coverages of solute atoms into
the surface layers of assorted hosts. From this database of DFT-
based BEO, two interpolative schemes to estimate BEO values
are developed. For the ﬁrst scheme, the interpolated BEO is
simply taken as the average of the BEO on the pure metals sur-
rounding the threefold sites. For example, the BEO on a PtPtPd
threefold site (in which the substrate of the surface alloy can
be either Pt or Pd) would be estimated as (2BEO(pure Pt) +
BEO(pure Pd))/3. The particular alloys analyzed with this in-
terpolative scheme (taken from a larger database in Ref. [24])
are selected by requiring that the oxygen atom move by no more
than 0.05 unit cell vectors (∼1/15 of a lattice constant) from the
threefold sites during relaxation, that the lattice constants of the
pure metals composing each alloy differ by no more than 0.2 Å,
and that the surface alloys contain only mixed (not pure) solute
overlayers. Thus, a total of 62 surface alloys are considered. For
the second scheme, the interpolated binding energies are again
calculated as an average of the BEO’s. In this case, however, the
basic data used for the interpolation come from pure overlayers,
not pure metals. For example, the BEO of a PtPtPd-on-Pt alloy
(in which Pt is the substrate) would be (2BEO(PtPtPt-on-Pt +
BEO(PdPdPd-on-Pt))/3. This scheme thus rigorously accounts
for strain and electronic structure effects of the substrate ele-
ment on the surface elements. The surface alloys analyzed in
this scheme include all of the alloys analyzed in the ﬁrst scheme
plus additional alloys resulting from the elimination of the lat-
tice constant restriction (102 in total).
2.2. Experimental details
2.2.1. Catalyst preparation
Spinel, MgAl2O4, a support with particle sizes of 0.25–
0.40 mm, a pore volume of about 0.7 cm3/g, and a surface area
of 70 m2/g, is used as a carrier material. Supported Ni/Fe cat-
alysts are prepared using incipient wetness impregnation of the
chosen sieve fraction of the support with aqueous solutions of
the corresponding nitrates. Before impregnation, the support is
dried in an oven at 200 ◦C for 5 h. A period of about 4 h is al-
lowed for the salt solution to completely ﬁll the pores of the
carrier. The impregnated spinel is then dried at room tempera-
ture for 12 h and heated in air to 450 ◦C at a rate of 2.5 ◦C/min
and kept at 450 ◦C for 3 h.
2.2.2. CO hydrogenation
The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts is tested
in CO hydrogenation. In a representative catalytic test, 150 mg
of the catalyst (fraction 0.25–0.40 mm) is placed into the quartz
plug-ﬂow U-tube reactor between two layers of quartz wool.
The ﬂow of 2 vol% CO in H2 is then admitted to the reactor
at an hourly space velocity of about 40,000 h−1 and a reaction
pressure of 1.0–1.1 bar. Before the activity measurements, the
catalysts are reduced at 500 ◦C for 4 h, after which the temper-
ature is lowered while the concentrations of CO, methane and
other products are monitored using a Shimadzu gas chromato-
graph equipped with thermal conductivity and ﬂame ionization
detectors. The results of the activity measurements are calcu-
lated as mol CO converted per mol of metal in the catalyst per
second,
rate = XCO · FCO
ncat
,
where XCO is the fractional conversion of CO, FCO denotes
the molar feed rate of CO (mol/s), and ncat is the total molar
amount of metal in the catalyst used in the activity test.
3. Results
3.1. Computational results
Following the analysis reported previously [5], the two im-
portant properties of a metal surface in determining the rate of
the methanation process are the barrier for CO dissociation and

the stability of the main intermediates on the surface, atomic
C and O. Extensive DFT calculations of these parameters for
different metal surfaces have shown them to be linearly cor-
related in what is called the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP)
relation [5], as shown in Fig. 1a. The reason for the correla-
tion is that the C–O bond in the transition state for dissociation
is so extended that it is very ﬁnal state-like, thus leaving the
transition state with bonding properties that vary like those of
adsorbed atomic C and O. This means that one independent
descriptor of the reactivity can be chosen as the dissociation en-
ergy of adsorbed CO, Ediss: the energy of C + O on the surface
relative to the energy of adsorbed CO [25].
A BEP relation typically leads to a volcano-shaped depen-
dence of the rate on Ediss [5]; see Fig. 1. For weak adsorption
(the right leg of the volcano), the barrier for dissociation is high
and limits the rate, whereas strong adsorption must lead to low
rates of removal of adsorbed C and O from the surface to form
the reaction products. This is illustrated in Fig. 1b, which shows
experimentally measured rates on a number of supported ele-

mental metal catalysts [5] as a function of the calculated Ediss
on the most active step sites of the metals. The optimum value
of Ediss can be seen to be Ediss(optimal) = 0.06 eV.
Having established that Ediss is a good descriptor for the
catalytic activity and having found its optimum value, we now
screen a number of catalysts, M, for their value of Ediss(M) =
|Ediss(M) −Ediss(optimal)|. We base our screening on a data-
base of values of Ediss for the elemental metals calculated
using DFT [4]. We calculate the values for an alloy surface
using an interpolation model in which the adsorption energy,
Eads, at a site with a fraction x of A neighbors and a frac-
tion (1 −x) of B neighbors is calculated as Eads(AxB1−x) =
xEads(A)+(1−x)Eads(B) [24,26,27]. We tested the model for
the adsorption energy of atomic oxygen on the threefold sites
of close-packed surfaces of a variety of surface alloys; Fig. 2
shows the results. The model gives rise to errors in the 0.1–
0.2 eV range compared with full DFT calculations. Comparing
this error with the range of energies, Ediss, in Fig. 1 shows that
this is a useful accuracy for a ﬁrst screening. When studying the
most promising candidates in more detail later in this paper, we
show that the interpolation concept works well for these sys-
tems.
We consider bulk alloys of the composition AxB1−x (x = 0,
0.25, 0.5, 1), where A and B can be any of the metals Ni, Pd, Pt,
Co, Rh, Ir, Fe, Ru, or Re. This creates a total of 117 different
catalysts in our study. We make the further approximation that
the bulk concentration, x, also indicates the range of concen-
tration of element metal A in the surface site. We have veriﬁed
that this is a good approximation for the two most interesting
alloys in the study.
The interpolation model immediately suggests candidates
for good alloy catalysts by combining elements on the left leg
and the right leg of the volcano in Fig. 1. Here we use a more
systematic approach in which we can include other important
factors in the problem. As mentioned in Section 1, catalyst op-
timization is usually a multiobjective optimization problem in
which it is not a priori possible to weigh the importance of
different factors in a single measure. We illustrate this by con-
sidering not only the catalytic activity, but also the price of the
catalyst. Multiobjective optimization problems are common in
the economics literature, where a common solution is to use
the Pareto-optimal set, as deﬁned by the economist V. Pareto
[28,29]. The Pareto-optimal set is the set of solutions that are
nondominated in the sense that it is impossible to choose an-
other solution and improve one property without making an-
other property worse.
Fig. 3 shows a plot of the methanation activity measure,
Ediss, and price for all 117 catalyst materials in our study.
Each alloy is represented by a point, and the Pareto-optimal
set is indicated. The ﬁgure shows that very good catalysts,
such as Ru, can be created, but these are also very expen-
sive. If, on the other hand, cost is the main concern, then
a less active catalyst, like Fe, is the best candidate. Ni lies
somewhere in between Ru and Fe and thus represents a
compromise if only pure metals are considered. Clearly, the
Ni–Fe alloys stand out because they form a “knee” in the
Pareto set, making the neighboring solutions in the Pareto

Fig. 2. All data points correspond to threefold site oxygen adsorption on heterogeneous binary surface alloys constructed from the same elemental metals as in Fig. 1
(pure metal overlayers are not included). Red triangles: interpolated values are estimated from arithmetic averaging of the appropriate pure metal binding energies.
Alloys with components having lattice constants differing by less than 0.2 Å are shown. The average error is 0.17 eV. This scheme does not rigorously account for,
e.g., strain differences between the pure metals and the surface alloys. Filled circles: interpolated values are estimated from arithmetic averaging of binding energies
on pure overlayers on the appropriate metal substrate. This scheme thus accounts rigorously for strain and electronic structure effects, and the average error is 0.1 eV.
Bulk alloys are expected to be in between these two limits, since they always have lattice constants intermediate between the corresponding constants of the pure
metals composing the alloy.

(x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1). Each blue point corresponds to a particular alloy. The elemental metals are shown (black), and the Pareto optimal set is also indicated (red).
The cost of the bimetallic alloys has been approximated by the current commodity price of the constituent elemental metals [37].
set considerably worse in one respect or the other. Conse-
quently, we studied the Ni3Fe and NiFe alloys in more de-
tail.
Fig. 1a includes the activation energy and dissociation en-
ergy for CO on step sites on Ni3Fe and NiFe. It can be seen
that the interpolation method works quite well; the value for the
alloys is between Ni and Fe and even follows the bulk concen-
tration x; the point for Ni3Fe is closest to the main component,
Ni, whereas the point for NiFe is close to the midpoint between
Fe and Ni. Therefore, the full DFT calculation supports the

505
model behind Fig. 2 and clearly predicts that both Ni3Fe and
NiFe should be good candidates for catalysts with an activity
higher than the constituents and close to that of the best cata-
lysts, Ru and Co. For Ni3Fe, our thermodynamic analysis of the
free energies of the surface under reaction conditions found that
the structure included in Fig. 1 is the most stable.
3.2. Experimental results
The Ni–Fe catalysts are synthesized and tested as described
in the Methods section, and the reaction rates are plotted as
a function of the Fe content in Fig. 4. The experiments com-
pletely conﬁrm the predictions from computational screening.
Depending slightly on temperature and concentration, the max-
imum activity is found either for Ni3Fe or in between Ni3Fe
and NiFe. The measured value of the catalytic activity for the
new Ni3Fe-based catalyst is almost as good as that for Co,
and it is considerably cheaper. Considering that no attempt
has been made to optimize the preparation method and acti-
vation procedure, this ﬁnding must be considered quite promis-
ing.

H2 as a function of the Fe content in FeNi alloy catalysts. Results are shown
for two different temperatures and two metal concentrations.
4. Discussion
Fe–Ni alloys have been found to have good catalytic prop-
erties for a partial oxidation of methane to syngas [30], and the
catalytic activity of Fe–Ni alloys has also been tested for other
hydrogenation reactions of carbon-containing compounds, such
as CO2 methanation [31] and benzene hydrogenation [32], with
varying success. In particular, it has been found that Ni–Fe al-
loys are good for CO hydrogenation under Fischer–Tropsch
conditions (i.e., high CO pressure) [33]. Based on this ﬁnd-
ing, it may not be very surprising that Fe–Ni alloys are su-
perior methanation catalysts. Still, we note that even a recent
state-of-the-art experimental high-throughput screening search
for methanation catalysts did not ﬁnd the results shown in
Fig. 4 [15].
Under the conditions of the present experiments correspond-
ing to the situation in which small amounts of CO (or CO2)
are removed from an H2 stream, the best catalysts all have
methane as the prime product (>90% selectivity). In view of
the renewed interest in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis in connec-
tion with the production of clean diesel and other fuels [10,34],
it would be interesting to extend the present analysis to in-
clude high CO pressures, at which the product distribution is
quite different. This cannot be done trivially, however, because
the optimum value of Ediss determining the overall rate is ex-
pected to depend on the reaction conditions [35] and because
for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, the selectivity is often more in-
teresting than the overall turnover.
The predictive power of the DFT calculations relies strongly
on the fact that the width of the volcano-like relation in Fig. 1b
is of the order several tenths of an eV—a general ﬁnding making
rates of complete catalytic reactions considerably less sensitive
to systematic errors in calculated interaction energies than the
rate of each of the individual reaction steps [2,3,36]. This is an
accuracy that can be routinely obtained by current versions of
the exchange-correlation functional [21].
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to establish
quantitative descriptors for the catalytic activity of the metha-
nation reaction by combining catalytic measurements with DFT
calculations of appropriate properties of the catalyst surface.
We can then use DFT calculations and models developed based
on these calculations to screen for new catalysts with better
catalytic performance. Synthesis and testing of these catalysts
revealed that they are superior to the conventional Ni catalyst.
We have also shown that it is possible to perform multivariable
optimization of catalyst properties, and suggest that the concept
of the Pareto-optimal set may be useful in catalyst development.
A number of challenges remain in the development of an
entirely computational approach to catalyst optimization. The
ﬁrst of these challenges is to provide a completely ab initio de-
termination of the optimum value for the descriptor. This will
entail the development of a reliable kinetic model. The sec-
ond challenge is to calculate the descriptor parameter directly
using DFT rather than using the interpolation model applied

here. Finally, it is clear that the reaction that we have studied
is extremely simple, and then more complex reactions with a
multitude of products will be considerably more demanding.
For such complex systems, we suggest that for the foreseeable
future, optimal use of the available computer power will proba-
bly dictate using a hierarchy of computational approaches, such
as those illustrated here.
