Using a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory
it is demonstrated how the nature of an inert host metal of an alloy can affect the thermodynamics and
kinetics of a reaction pathway in a much more profound way than simply a dilution, electronic, or
geometric effect. This study reveals that individual, isolated Pd atoms can promote H2 dissociation and
spillover onto a Cu(111) surface, but that the same mechanism is not observed for an identical array of Pd
atoms in Au(111).

Metal alloys are unique materials with properties that
can stray far from those of their constituent elements.
Alloys are often heterogeneous at the atomic scale and a
complex electronic and geometric interplay between the
atoms of the various elements yields new and useful ma-
terial properties. In these systems the electronic interac-
tions between the different elements in an alloy (ligand
effects), the change in lattice parameters due to alloying
(strain effects), and the spatial distribution of atomic sites
(ensemble effects) inﬂuence the distinctive physical and
electronic features which make alloys so appealing [1,2].
Alloying is often used in ﬁelds such as catalysis or
metallurgy to ‘‘dilute’’ an expensive, reactive material in
a cheaper, more inert host. In this way the character of the
minority element can still dominate the material properties
without the higher cost of a pure metal component. This
property is extremely useful in heterogeneous catalysis,
where reaction rates and pathways can be altered by tuning
the alloy composition [3–5]. A common explanation for
such behavior is that the reaction of interest can still be
catalyzed by the minority active component; however,
mixing in a more passive host allows products to be
released more easily. This approach can even lead to
enhanced reaction rates and selectivities [3,6,7].
One key reaction step in which alloy catalysts are often
employed is the dissociation of molecular hydrogen, which
is a crucial part of a number of energy-related technolo-
gies including the hydrogenation of CO2, water gas shift
catalysis, and hydrogen separation [8–10]. In methanol
synthesis the most common metal used as a catalyst is
Cu [11]. H2 dissociation on pure Cu is activated and occurs
very slowly unless high pressures and temperatures are
used to drive the reactions [12]. Hydrogen dissociation
on Pt-group metals, in contrast, is facile and occurs readily
at room temperature and ambient pressures. These obser-
vations suggest that a bifunctional catalyst composed of a
relatively inert metal such as Cu or Au with a minority
Pt-group metal component that can readily dissociate hy-
drogen may be a superior catalyst when hydrogen is a
reactive species, but the catalysis would primarily occur
on the host metal.
The atomic-scale geometric and reactive properties of
small amounts of Pd alloyed with both Cu and Au(111)
host surfaces were investigated in this work using low-
temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
density functional theory (DFT). This study shows how
Pd atoms can modify both the ability of these surfaces to
dissociate hydrogen and the subsequent hydrogen atom
spillover from the Pd sites onto the host surfaces. These
results demonstrate that individual, isolated Pd atoms are
active for the dissociation of H2 if supported in the correct
host.
Isolated Pd atoms alloyed into Cu(111) and Au(111)
hosts were synthesized by physical vapor deposition of
small amounts of Pd onto the clean surfaces during con-
trolled annealing. In agreement with previous studies
[3,13], no Pd-Pd dimers were observed at low Pd cover-
ages; the Pd atoms were always surrounded by either Cu or
Au neighbors. These isolated Pd sites have been shown to
be active for catalytic reactions such as vinyl acetate syn-
thesis on Pd=Auð111Þ [3,14]. In both surfaces it was also
possible to distinguish between individual Pd atoms in the
surface layer (which appeared as protrusions) and subsur-
face Pd atoms in the layer below the surface (which ap-
peared as depressions), in good agreement with previous
STM studies of similar bimetallic near-surface alloys
[13,15,16].
Alloying begins at the step edges in a Cu substrate as
shown in Fig. 1(a), suggesting that Pd adatoms are mobile
on the terraces until they collide with an ascending step
edge where they adsorb and are incorporated into the sur-
face or subsurface [13,16]. Figure 1(b) shows a Au(111)

, or herringbone reconstruction,
after deposition of Pd. On the Au(111) surface, the elbows
of the herringbone reconstruction act as sites for the place
exchange of Pd atoms before the Pd disperses into the
surface and subsurface layers [inset of Fig. 1(b)]. In order
to compare the properties of isolated Pd atoms in both Cu

and Au, each of the alloy systems was dosed with the same
amount of Pd [0.01 monolayer (ML)] at a temperature that
yielded 50% surface and 50% subsurface Pd.
After exposure to 10 L (where 1 L ¼ 1  106 Torr  s)
of H2 at 420 K, no hydrogen dissociation was observed on
the bare Cu(111) surface, which is consistent with previous
reports [17]. However, after 0.01 ML Pd was alloyed into
the Cu(111) surface and exposed to the same amount of
hydrogen at 420 K, a large amount of hydrogen was
present on the surface. STM imaging after cooling the
sample to 7 K revealed that these H atoms clustered into
islands as shown in Fig. 2 [18]. Salmeron and co-workers
reported that for H coverages near 1 ML, three vacant sites
around a Pd atom are required for hydrogen dissociation on
Pd(111) [19]. The results presented here do not contradict
the work of Salmeron et al., but show the interesting effect
that in the low H coverage regime individual, isolated Pd
atoms are very efﬁcient at dissociating molecular hydro-
gen. Extensive STM imaging revealed a sharp decrease in
H coverage further from the Pd atoms, which is consistent
with H2 dissociation occurring at the Pd atom sites. In
contrast to the Cu surface, no hydrogen atoms were ob-
served on a Au(111) surface containing an identical
amount of Pd atoms after exposure to the same H2 ﬂux.
The stability of isolated Pd atoms in Cu and Au(111)
was investigated using density functional theory. The heat
of formation was calculated for 21 different clean surface
alloy conﬁgurations with compositions spanning from pure
host (Cu or Au) to a full monolayer of Pd on the surface of
the host. The lattice constant of the surface was ﬁxed to the
lattice constant of the host, which was also calculated using
density functional theory (Cu 3.67 A
˚ , Au 4.18 A
˚ ). Pd
exothermically alloys into both Cu and Au(111) surfaces.
At coverages below xPd ¼ 0:4, Pd atoms are most thermo-
dynamically stable when surrounded by Cu or Au atoms,
consistent with exothermic alloy formation and maximiza-
tion of Pd-Cu or Pd-Au bonds. These results are consistent
with STM observations in this study and others [13,16].
The Pd alloy surfaces have a distribution of different
active sites where hydrogen atoms can adsorb, including
sites with and without the Pd atom present. The preferen-
tial adsorption site for hydrogen is the threefold fcc hollow
site [20,21]. The adsorption energies of hydrogen were
modeled on a ð3  2Þ  4 layer fcc(111) surface. The
slab surfaces were separated by 10 A
˚ of vacuum space
and the Brillouin zone was sampled by an 8  6  1
Monkhorst-Pack grid. The stability of hydrogen was cal-
culated in the fcc hollow sites of alloys containing an
individual Pd atom in both Cu(111) and Au(111) host
surfaces. H atoms located on a Pd fcc site were labeled
S1, with a H atom on one Pd and two host metal atoms. As
the H moved away from the Pd by one fcc site onto the host
metal a calculation was performed for this site, labeled S2,
with the H located on three host metal atoms. Finally the
energy was calculated for a site with only the host metal
and no Pd contributions, labeled Mð111Þ. The Perdew-
Wang 1991 (PW91) exchange-correlation functional was
utilized to calculate the adsorption energies. The adsorp-
tion energies were also calculated using the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof
(PBE),
revised
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
(revPBE),
and
alternative
revised
Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof (RPBE) functionals non-self-consistently [22]
to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the exchange-
correlation functional. The PW91 and RPBE functionals
are expected to span the range of expected values with

PW91 yielding the most stable energies and RPBE yielding
the weaker range of energies [23]. These results are sum-
marized in Fig. 3.
The exchange-correlation functionals all yielded the
same trends in adsorption energies with a variation of
0:09–0:16 eV=H between PW91 and RPBE for each site.
Here only the PW91 results are discussed. Hydrogen fa-
vorably adsorbs on the Pd S1 site with an adsorption energy
with respect to molecular hydrogen ( 1
2 H2 ! H) of
0:24 eV=H. The adsorption energy on the neighboring
S2 site is 0:14 eV=H, which is slightly weaker than the
adsorption energy of hydrogen on Cu(111).
In contrast to Cu(111), hydrogen dissociation is endo-
thermic on Au(111). Hydrogen favorably adsorbs at iso-
lated Pd atoms in Au(111) (S1) with an adsorption en-
ergy of 0:15 eV=H, although the RPBE functional
suggests the adsorption may be slightly unfavorable at
þ0:01 eV=H. The hydrogen adsorption energy at S2 is
þ0:07 eV=H indicating that molecular desorption of H2
is thermodynamically favorable. It is not surprising in this
context that after deposition of H2 at identical conditions to
the Pd=Cuð111Þ data, no hydrogen spillover was observed
on either the Au(111) or the Pd=Auð111Þ surfaces.
The free energies of adsorption have also been con-
sidered to incorporate the effects of zero-point energy,
pressure, and temperature using standard atomistic ther-
modynamics [24,25] and the PW91 adsorption energies
discussed above. At 0 K, the free adsorption energies are
slightly weaker than the DFT adsorption energies due to
the zero-point energies of the adsorbate and the H2 mole-
cule. At 420 K, however, the adsorption energies are sub-
stantially reduced due to entropy in molecular hydrogen,
and the calculations suggest that dissociative adsorption of
hydrogen is highly unfavorable on the Au host but only
slightly unfavorable on the Cu host. Dissociative adsorp-
tion on Cu is favorable at temperatures less than 420 K.
The dissociation and diffusion barriers between some of
the key adsorption sites were also investigated. The disso-
ciation barrier for H2 on Cu(111) has been calculated to be
0.5 eV [26], although experimental estimates put the bar-
rier in the range of 0.3–0.4 eV [17,27]. The same method in
Ref. [26] has been used to calculate the dissociation barrier
over an isolated Pd atom in Cu(111) and a barrier of only
0.02 eV was obtained. Although this method may under-
estimate the barrier, it suggests the existence of a very low
barrier dissociation pathway over the Pd atom, consistent
with the experimental observations of efﬁcient dissociative
adsorption at 420 K in the presence of individual, isolated
Pd atoms.
Nudged elastic band calculations were used to estimate
barriers for the adsorbed H atoms to diffuse away from Pd.
The calculated barriers were in the range 0.12–0.15 eV
from the weaker adsorption energy site to the stronger
adsorption energy site. Diffusion barriers were previously
reported on late transition metals in the range of 0.12–
0.18 eV, and were found to be correlated with adsorption
energies of both the initial and ﬁnal sites [28]. The calcu-
lated and estimated dissociation and diffusion barriers are
summarized in Fig. 4, where two possible spillover mecha-
nisms are examined. Both mechanisms are feasible, illus-
trating how dissociative H2 adsorption can be catalyzed by
individual, isolated Pd atoms supported in the correct host.
The understanding that emerges from these results is that
hydrogen dissociation is thermodynamically feasible on

isolated Pd atoms in Cu(111) and Au(111). Spillover is
activated and feasible on Cu(111) but thermodynamically
infeasible on Au(111) due to desorption of molecular
hydrogen. This work also indicates that the hydrogen
dissociation barrier is high on Cu(111), where negligible
hydrogen dissociation is observed experimentally, and that
the barrier is a great deal lower at Pd sites, where signiﬁ-
cant dissociation and spillover is observed under the same
experimental conditions.
These results reveal that small amounts of individual,
isolated Pd atoms can efﬁciently dissociate H2 and allow it
to spill over onto an appropriate host metal. While it is
known that H spillover can occur from Pd to Cu sites in the
synthesis of methanol [29,30], the results from our study
demonstrate that this approach is more general and that
multiple alloy combinations can be surveyed theoretically
in an identical manner in order to identify potential candi-
date systems. Careful selection of the host metal and the
catalytically active atom in an alloyed system will enable
dissociation and spillover of species that typically do not
react due to high kinetic barriers (e.g., O2 on Au). Such
bifunctional alloy catalyst surfaces will yield tunable cata-
lytic properties such as stability, adsorption energy, and
spillover barrier.
