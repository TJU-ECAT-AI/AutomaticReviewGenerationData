Abstract
While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging. In this contribution we present experimental analysis supported with quantum chemical DFT calculations which allowed us to propose a simple, physically transparent model to predict the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure of different sites in alloys and on the local chemical reactivity. The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.

1 Introduction
Alloys are an important class of materials that often exhibit unique physical and chemical characteristics, such as exceptional hardness [1] or superior chemical reactivity [2]. As such, alloys show promise for many applications including heterogeneous catalysis [3–8]. While the potential for the utilization of alloys in heterogeneous catalysis is significant, predictive models relating the geometric structure of alloys to their chemical reactivity are lacking. A suitable predictive model needs to be able to answer the question: How does the chemical reactivity of a site in a metal change as an alloy, characterized by a formation of chemical bonds between two or more different metal atoms, is formed? We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site.
It has been shown previously by Hammer and Nørskov that the binding of various adsorbates on metals (pure metals as well as alloys) can be explained with the “d-band model” of bonding [9–13]. This model relates the local electronic structure of a catalytic site on a metal, more specifically the center of the d-band of the site (i.e., the average energy of d-states), to the chemical reactivity of the site. Metals with a higher d-band center, with respect to the Fermi level, bind most adsorbates more strongly than metals with a lower d-band center. For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals). The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center. For metals with the d-band center higher in energy (closer to the Fermi level), the anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states are higher in energy, and therefore less populated, than for metals with an energetically lower d-band center. The consequence of this is that the strength of the interaction between the adsorbates and the metal sites, characterized by an energetically higher d-band center, is stronger than the interaction between the adsorbates and the sites characterized by a lower d-band center.
The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals. The predictive capacity of the model stems from the fact that the relative positions of the d-band center for pure metals can be easily deduced. The position of the d-band center of a site in a metal is governed by the number of occupied d-states, localized on the site, and the overlap between the d-states (orbitals) of the metal atoms that form the site. The overlap among the d-states governs the width and shape of the d-band, and it is a function of the geometry (distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site) and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals. The spatial extent of the d-orbitals is characteristic length of the metal orbitals, related to the local atom potential [14]. For any pure metal the number of occupied d-states and the overlap between the d-states are known, and therefore the relative position of the d-band center and the relative chemical activity of the metal can be easily estimated [14]. For example, for metals in a column in the periodic table of elements, the d-band filling is identical (same number of d electrons), while the spatial extent of d-orbitals increases from top to bottom of the column. The increased extent of d-orbitals yields a broader d-band which results in lower energy of the d-band center with respect to Fermi level and lower chemical reactivity for the metals at the bottom of the column. Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band. Differences in the d-band filling are responsible for the difference in chemical reactivity of metals in the same row of the periodic table.
The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center. The possibility of the transfer of charge from one alloy element to another further complicates the physical picture, and it is difficult to devise a universal model that can capture the general behavior of alloys [7, 8].
In this contribution we present experimental analysis supported with quantum chemical DFT calculations which allowed us to propose a simple, physically transparent model to predict the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure of different sites in alloys and on the local chemical reactivity. The experimental analysis was performed on a number of Pt (Pt/Cu, Pt/Ru, and Pt/Sn) and Ni (Ni/Sn, Ni/Au, Ni/Ag) alloys. The alloys were selected to cover a broad range of electronically different elements including 3d (Ni, Cu) metals interacting with 4d (Ag, Ru), 5d (Au, Pt), and sp (Sn) metals. Since we arrived to identical conclusions for both families of alloys (Pt and Ni alloys), we discuss herein in detail the results for the Pt alloys. The results for the Ni alloys have been shown in our previous contributions [4, 15]. Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models [16–19]. Below we describe our experimental procedure, including the description of the synthetic routes used to synthesize the Pt alloys, experimental measurements, and theoretical calculations. This is followed by the discussion of our results.
2 Methodology
2.1 Catalysts Synthesis
The Pt catalysts were synthesized using a dry impregnation method utilizing γ-Al2O3 powder (Alpha Aesar, 3 micron, BET surface area (S.A.) ~78 m2/g, 99.97% metal basis) as a support. To remove impurities from the support, the powder was first stirred in DI water. Ammonium hydroxide was then added to the solution until the pH reached 10. The powder was then rinsed several times with DI water, dried under vacuum overnight, and calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 h. The Pt catalyst (10 wt% Pt with respect to Al2O3 support) was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.95% metals basis; Alpha Aesar) in just enough volume of water to fill the micropore structure of the Al2O3 support, as measured by BET analysis (0.366 mL/g). The solution was added dropwise to the Al2O3 support. To ensure an even coverage of the solution on the support, the powder was shaken vigorously during the addition of the solution. Following the addition of the solution, the powder was crushed with a mortar and pestle.
To synthesize the alloy catalysts, a similar impregnation procedure was used to deposit an equimolar amount of Pt and the secondary metal on the support. In this case two solutions, one containing H2PtCl6·6H2O (sufficient for a 5% Pt/Al2O3) in DI water and the other containing an equimolar amount of the secondary metal salt (CuCl2, RuCl3, or SnCl2) in DI water, were prepared. The total amount of DI water between the two solutions was enough to fill the micropore structure of the support. The Pt and secondary metal solutions were then dispersed on the Al2O3 support sequentially, as described above. All samples were then dried overnight under vacuum, and reduced in hydrogen (Cryogenic gases, prepurified, 200 mL/min) at 300 °C for 3 h.
The formation of the alloy catalysts was verified using x-ray absorption spectroscopy as discussed below. When using the term alloy we refer to a partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element.
2.2 X-ray Absorption
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were performed at Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photo Source (APS) beamline MR-CAT 10-ID-B. Scans of the Pt L3 edge (~11564 eV) were collected in transmission mode using standard equipment and procedures available on-site [20]. The spectra for each sample were recorded simultaneously with the spectra for Pt foil, containing pure Pt, which was used for energy calibration. Samples were packed into wafers supported in a steel sample tube, which could accommodate six separate samples. The steel sample holder was then placed in a glass in situ reactor. The samples were re-reduced in 4%H2/N2 at ~600 K for 1 h. To ensure that any residual hydrogen is removed for the catalysts, the samples were flushed in N2 at ~600 K before reducing the temperature of the samples to room temperature. Scans were performed at room temperature in trapped nitrogen.
XAS measurements in the extended edge region (EXAFS) were analyzed using free online software Athena and Artemis, utilizing standard analysis procedures [21]. First, the alloy curves were calibrated by setting the energy of the Pt foil edge data with the maximum slope to the theoretical Pt L3 edge energy, 11564 eV. This point is defined as the edge onset energy, Eo. Next, the background signal for each curve was removed by fitting the pre-edge data to a linear function and subtracting out the result. The curves were normalized by fitting the post-edge data to a third degree polynomial and dividing the data by the extrapolated value at Eo. XAFS data was fit using Artemis. Phase and amplitude for each first nearest neighbor scattering path (Pt–Pt and Pt–M where M = Cu, Ru, or Sn) were calculated using FEFF [21]. The fitting parameters were optimized using a least squares analysis of the nearest neighbor region of the k1, k2, and k3 Fourier transform data.
2.3 Computational Details
2.3.1 Adsorption Energy Calculation
The adsorption energies for various adsorbates on the different model systems were calculated with respect to the corresponding gas phase energies (CO, O2 and H2) using first principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. The DFT calculations were performed using the ultra-soft pseudopotential [22] plane-wave method with the generalized gradient approximation [23] (GGA-PW91) coded in Dacapo [24]. The wave-functions were expanded in plane-waves with an energy cutoff of 350 eV. The pure Pt was modeled by a 2 × 2 × 4 slab separated by 10 Å of vacuum space. The Pt skin alloys were modeled by substituting the second Pt layer in the pure Pt slab with a layer of a guest metal. Identical models have been used previously [18]. An adsorbate was placed on one side of the slab. The impact of the adsorbate-induced dipole moment was minimized by applying a dipole correction. The adsorbates and top two layers were allowed to relax until the total force on the atoms was less than 0.05 eV/Å. In the p(2 × 2) Pt surface unit cell, 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-points were used for the Brillouin-zone integration [25]. A finite temperature Fermi function (k B T el = 0.1 eV) was utilized to facilitate the SCF convergence, and the total energy was extrapolated to k B T el = 0 eV. This computational setup allowed for the convergence of relative adsorption energies, with the maximum change in the difference between the adsorption energies of an adsorbate on any two substrates less than 0.02 eV for calculations with increased accuracy. The d-band density of states was determined by projection of the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals, with the cutoff radius at infinity. The d-band center was calculated as the first moment of the projected d-band density of states on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level, and the mean squared d-band width was calculated as the second moment.
2.3.2 Calculations of XANES Spectra (Oscillator Strength)
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the Pt L 3 edge was calculated from first-principles, using plane wave pseudopotential approach within the CASTEP code [26], by evaluating the oscillator strength for the electron transition from 2p Pt core states to the Pt 6s and 5d states above the Fermi level. The exchange–correlation was described using PW91 functional of the generalized gradient approximation [23] (GGA). The wave-functions are expanded in plane-waves with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. A (12 × 12 × 12) Monkhorst–Pack [25] set of k-points was used for Brillouin zone sampling of 1 × 1 × 1 unit cell and the k-points density was kept identical for calculation with different supercell size. In order to compare the calculated oscillator strength with measured XANES spectra, the system was modeled by a supercell with the lattice constant from experimental measurement. To account for the impact of a core hole, generated in the process of the XANES measurement, on the electronic structure the ultrasoft pseudopotential for the atom in the supercell was generated with partial occupancy of core states [27]. All calculations with core holes were carried out using supercells sufficiently large to eliminate the interactions between core holes in the periodic images. Our calculations, in agreement with previous literature [28], have indicated that 8 Å is large enough to isolate the interaction between images. The calculated spectra for all alloys are adjusted (shifted in energy by a constant value) so that the calculated edge onset energy for pure Pt corresponds to the experimentally measured edge onset energy of pure Pt L 3 edge. Gaussian broadening with 3.0 eV, which encompasses instrumental broadening and the lifetime of excited states, was applied in order to compare calculated spectra to experimental measurements.
3 Results
As stated in the introduction section, the ultimate objective is to establish a cause and effect relationship between a formation of an alloy and the change in the local chemical reactivity of sites in the alloy. There are many concrete examples where it was shown that the formation of alloys lead to significantly different and often unanticipated chemical reactivities of geometrically identical sites in the alloys. For example, it has been shown recently that the catalytic activity of Pt can be changed significantly by combining Pt with 3d metals to form 3d-M/Pt skin alloys [8, 18, 29]. When used as electrodes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, the 3d-M/Pt alloys exhibit higher tolerance to CO and lower over-potential losses associated with the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than pure Pt [8]. This improved performance of the 3d-M/Pt alloys is attributed to a lowering of the chemical reactivity of the Pt sites in the alloy induced by 3d-metals, i.e., Pt sites in the alloys bind CO and oxygen adsorbates with lower adsorption energies than geometrically identical Pt sites in pure Pt. While the 3d-metal-induced lowering of the Pt chemical reactivity seems counterintuitive considering that most 3d metals are chemically more reactive than Pt, it is fully consistent with d-band theory. Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations have shown that as a 3-d metal and Pt are brought together to form an alloy, the average energy of the d-states projected on Pt atoms decreases, i.e., the position of the center of the d-band is lowered with respect to Fermi level [30]. This is illustrated in our DFT calculations shown in Fig. 1b where we plotted adsorption energy for various adsorbates on 3d-M/Pt skin model alloys as a function of the calculated center of the d-band projected on the surface Pt atoms.

To understand the origin of the 3d-metal-induced shifts in the position of the local d-band center and therefore in the chemical reactivity of Pt sites, we first discuss various mechanisms that can affect the position of the d-band center localized on an atom in metal alloys. When two different metals (transition or noble) are brought in contact with each other to form an alloy, the center of d-band localized on an atom in the alloy with respect to Fermi level can be affected by: (i) Transfer of electronic charge from one atom to another without a change in the width of d-band as shown in Fig. 1a. This is basically a rigid band model [16] which manifests itself in a change in the position of the d-band center with respect to the Fermi level without a change in the shape of the bands, (ii) Change in the width of the d-band, due to the hybridization between the d-orbitals of the atom in question with the valence orbital of the neighboring atoms, without significant charge transfer as shown in Fig. 1b. This model is consistent with the “rectangular band” model [30], and it also leads to shifts in the position of the d-band center. (iii) Combination of charge transfer and a change in the width of the d-band. One of these three mechanisms will dominate the change in the position of the d-band center as long as the shape of the d band, defined in terms of skewness and kurtosis, is not significantly affected by alloying.
To address which mechanism dominates the position of the d-band center in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of the local alloy sites, we measured the electronic structure in the neighborhood of the Fermi level for multiple Pt alloys (Pt/Cu, Pt/Ru, and Pt/Sn). To establish that our synthesis procedure yields the formation of alloys, defined as partial or complete solid solution of one element in a metallic matrix of another element, we used Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. EXAFS probes the local geometric environment of an atom in a sample. In Fig. 2 we show the measured Pt L3 EXAFS spectra for pure Pt and three Pt alloy samples. The figure shows that there is a significant difference in the spectra of pure Pt and Pt alloys, which is indicative of the formation of the alloy materials. The measured spectra are also compared to the best fit EXAFS spectra. The best fit spectra for all alloys were always characterized by Pt–Pt and Pt–M (where M is a guest metal in the Pt host) scattering paths, which suggested the formation of partial or complete solid solution of the guest element in a metallic matrix of the Pt host. The parameters used to obtain the best fit spectra are shown in Table 1.

To measure the electronic structure of the materials we used X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy. This technique allows us to measure electronic states above the Fermi level localized on a particular element in a material. For example, the Pt L3 XANES spectra maps out the s and d density of states (DOS) above the Fermi level projected on a Pt atom in a material by measuring the photo-absorption cross-section associated with the excitation of the Pt 2p core electrons to unoccupied Pt 6s and 5d states. Since the spectra above the Fermi level is dominated by the d states, the measurement basically yields the local d DOS projected on the Pt atom [31]. The measured Pt L3 XANES spectra for the pure Pt and the Pt alloys are shown in Fig. 3a and b. It is clear that the formation of the alloys results in a change of the Pt L3 spectra; there are shifts in the position of the peak onset energy (E0) and the width of the peak. It can be seen that the PtRu sample exhibits the narrowest, tallest peak. The PtSn sample is characterized by the broadest and shortest Pt L3 spectra. We also observe that the PtSn and PtCu samples exhibit a shift of approximately +0.5 eV in Eo.

To identify the origin of the observed change in the Pt L3 edge, we used first-principles, plane wave pseudopotential calculations to calculate the oscillator strengths for the electron transition from the Pt 2p core states to the unoccupied Pt 5d and 6s states above the Fermi level for pure Pt and the Pt alloys. In the calculations of the oscillator strengths we used the alloy crystal structures (PtRu (\( Fm\bar{3}m \)), Pt3Sn (\( Pm\bar{3}m \)), and PtCu (\( R\bar{3}m \))) identified in the literature [32, 33], which were also consistent with the bond distances of the measured EXAFS spectra. The oscillator strengths, which are basically the computational equivalent of XANES, are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Initial and final state approximations, as well as the Slater approximation were used to calculate the oscillator strengths [27]. In the calculation of the oscillator strength, the initial state approximation assumes the ground state electronic configuration, the final state approximation assumes an excited state electronic configuration with an electron transferred from the Pt 2p core state to the 5d orbital, while the Slater approximation assumes the electronic configuration with ½ of an electron removed from the 2p core state and ½ of an electron added in the 5d orbital. We found that for all materials the measured Pt L3 edge was reproduced fairly well with the initial state approximation. This is not surprising considering that the interaction between a core hole and the electron promoted above the Fermi level in Pt is expected to be small due to electron shielding in Pt. The agreement between the measured spectra and the spectra calculated using the initial state approximation shows that for the samples considered herein, the measured Pt oscillator strength (XANES) maps very well on the local Pt DOS of d-symmetry in the ground state, i.e., it allows us to develop a ground state model. Further analysis of the calculated local DOS showed that the change in the width of the Pt L3 edge in response to alloying is a consequence of the hybridization of the d-states of Pt and the valence orbitals of the neighboring atoms in the alloys [15].
In addition to providing information about the width of local d-DOS projected on Pt atoms, the Pt L3 edge also allows for a quantification of the number of electronic states above the Fermi level localized on the Pt atom. The number of localized d states is proportional to the integrated area under the measured normalized spectra or calculated oscillator strength [34]. In the inset in Fig. 3b we show integrated areas, i.e., the relative numbers of d-sates above the Fermi level localized on Pt atoms for pure Pt and the Pt alloys. This figure shows that the number of d states localized on Pt does not change significantly in response to alloying. This indicates that the transfer of d-holes (and therefore electrons) between Pt atoms and the atoms of another element in the alloys is very small, i.e., the local potential of atoms in the alloys is sufficient to preserve the local charge on the atoms. These experimental observations are consistent with the results of DFT calculations which showed that for a given cut-off radius, the area under the d-DOS projected on Pt atoms was identical for different alloys, i.e. there is no charge transfer to or from the Pt d-states.
4 Discussion
The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of the guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states. We note that we obtained identical conclusions in similar experimental analysis of Ni alloys (mainly Ni/Sn, Ni/Au, and Ni/Ag) [15].
There are a number of important consequences of these observations. One critical consequence is that since upon the formation of alloys the local d-charge on alloy atoms is preserved, the local d-band center and therefore the chemical reactivity of the atoms in different alloys are mainly functions of the local d-band width (the spread of localized d-states around the Fermi level). For example, a simple geometric analysis of a model rectangular or elliptical local density of states, similar to the analysis shown in Fig. 1a(2), demonstrates that if the d-DOS localized on a metal atom becomes wider in response to alloying, the d-band center will move down in energy to maintain the local charge neutrality. Similarly, if the local d-band becomes narrower, the center of the d-band will move up in energy. This change in the position of the d-band center has profound consequences on the chemical activity of metal sites as shown in Fig. 1b.
The second important consequence is that for a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site. For example, since the distance between Pt and the 3d metals in the 3d-M/Pt skin alloys is approximately equal for the different alloys—this is reasonable since the geometry is to a large degree governed by the s/p states, which are in the case of 3d metals very similar to each other—the width of the d-band projected on the Pt adsorption sites (and therefore the center of d-band and the chemical reactivity of the sites), will only be a function of the extent of the d-orbitals (r dm ) of the 3d metals bonded to the Pt site.
We have tested the predicted relationships by using DFT to calculate the adsorption energy of various adsorbates on geometrically identical Pt surface sites on a number of model 3d-M/Pt skin alloys. The optimization of the geometries for these structures using DFT calculations confirmed that the bond distances between the Pt and 3d metals are approximately equal for all 3-d metals. Figure 4a shows that the adsorption energies for various adsorbates are linearly dependent on not only the d-band center (as shown in Fig. 1b), but also the spatial extent of the d-orbitals (r
3/2
dm
) of the 3d metals bonded to the Pt adsorption site, as predicted in the discussion in the previous paragraph. The values for the spatial extent of d-orbitals were obtained from Solid State Tables [14]. Figure 4(b,c) also show that similar relationships exist for adsorption on geometrically identical Pt sites on 4d-M/Pt and 5d-M/Pt skin alloys. The fact that the adsorption energies for the adsorption on the Pt surface sites scale as r
3/2
dm
, where r dm is the spatial extent of d orbitals of metals which are in contact with the Pt surface sites, is not surprising since according to the tight bonding approximation (Atomic Sphere Approximation [14]) for a fixed geometry (bond distance between the elements that form an alloy) the d-band width projected on a given atom in an alloy is proportional to r
3/2
dm
. The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r dm ) is that the values of r dm are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily. It is important to recognize that the impact of the local geometry on the width of the d-band, localized on an atom in an alloy, can also be evaluated easily based on the tight bonding approximation. It has been shown that the width of the d-band is proportional to 1/d5, where d is the length of the bond between the atom of interest and the atoms surrounding it in the alloy [35].

The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy. Since the bond distance between constituent elements in alloys can be predicted by for example assuming that it is equal to the addition of atomic radii of the elements that form the alloy, and the spatial extent of orbitals in alloys is known, the position of the center of the d-band for various sites in alloys and therefore the chemical reactivity of these sites can also be predicted easily. These relationships were also recognized in recent contributions of Kitchin et al. where DFT calculations were used to analyze a large number of alloys [18].
It is also important to address the ambiguity of the term charge transfer from one element in an alloy to another. In the analysis above, we have referred to the transfer of d electrons from one element to another in terms of a uniquely defined, measured or calculated, area under the oscillator strength curve, establishing that there is no significant transfer of d-electrons among constituent elements in alloys. This information was sufficient to design a model which allows us to predict the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure and chemical reactivity. This definition of charge transfer is universal since it is independent of the cut-off radius over which the charge is integrated. We note that if we used the area under the calculated d-DOS projected on Pt atoms to calculate the local charge, our result would depend heavily on the cut-off radius, as shown in Fig. 5. It is also possible to define the localized charge in terms of the partitioning of the ground state electron density among the atoms in the alloy. For example, the Bader charge analysis partitions the total electronic charge in a unique way among different atoms in the system. When we perform Bader analysis on the DFT-calculated electron density of the model alloys we find that there are shifts in the electron density from one element to another as shown in Fig 5. Projection of various local orbitals on local volumes centered in particular alloy atoms, shows that the main contributors to the charge transfer are s/p electrons. It can be shown that small changes in the filling of s/p bands affect the adsorption energy much less significantly than the above-discussed changes in the center of the d-band. For example, our analysis using the Newns-Anderson (N-A) model of chemisorption to isolate and quantify the impact of the changes in the filling of a broad substrate band (s/p-like) on the interaction of the substrate with an adsorbate single state showed that for changes in the band filling of ~0.2 electrons, there was no significant change in the interaction energy (<0.1 eV). In the N-A analysis all properties of the substrate, other than the filling of the band, were kept constant. For details about the N-A model, see the original contributions [36, 37] and following publications [10].

5 Conclusions
We performed XAS studies to measure the electronic structure of a number of Pt alloys aiming to identify relationships between the geometric structure of alloys and their chemical reactivity. Our analysis showed that: (i) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, (ii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states, (iii) the consequence of (i) and (ii) is that there exist a universal relationship between the width of the localized d-band (i.e., the spread around the Fermi level) and the local d-band center and therefore the local chemical reactivity, (iv) since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted, (v) while the partitioning of the calculated ground state electron density is consistent with the experimental finding that there is no transfer of d-electrons from one alloy element to another, it shows that there are shifts in the s/p electron density, (vi) Newns-Anderson analysis showed that the impact of the shifts in the s/p electron density on the chemical reactivity of metal atoms in an alloy is significantly lower than the impact of the changes in the center of the d-band.
