Bimetallic Catalysts 
Chemical reaction rates are controlled by varying the composition 
of 
miniscule clusters of 
metal atoms. Such clusters are now employed 
in petroleum refining and may have a number of 
other applications 
I
n 1817 the English chemist Sir 
Humphrey Davy discovered a re­
.' markable property of platinum. 
He found that in the presence of that 
metal oxygen reacts readily, often ex­
plosively, with other gases such as 
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and var­
ious volatile hydrocarbons. Such re­
actions can occur in spite of the fact 
that the initial temperature of the gas­
es and of the platinum may be far low­
er than that required for ignition in the 
absence of platinum. The platinum­
induced combustion reactions, which 
yield water and carbon dioxide as 
products, do not consume the plati­
num. The work of Davy provided an 
example of the phenomenon of ca­
talysis, a term (meaning "loosening" 
in Greek) introduced by the Swedish 
chemist Jons Jakob Berzelius in 1836. 
Although Berzelius recognized the im­
portance of catalytic phenomena in 
chemistry, a lack of understanding of 
the basic principles involved hindered 
progress for many years. A major ad­
vance took place in about 1900 when 
the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald 
proposed that a catalyst can influence 
only the rate of a chemical reaction; a 
chemical change occurring in the pres­
ence of a catalyst must also be capable 
of occurring in the absence of a cata­
lyst, although at a much lower rate. 
Ostwald's insight paved the way for 
the widespread investigation and ap­
plication of catalytic phenomena. Cat­
alytic processes now provide the ba­
sic technology for the manufacture of 
a host of vitally important materi­
als, ranging from fertilizers to synthet­
ic fibers and petroleum products such 
as gasoline and heating oil. Work done 
by my colleagues and me over the past 
two decades at the Exxon Research 
Laboratories has contributed to these 
applications and to an understanding 
of catalysts. We have focused our ef­
forts on bimetallic catalysts (catalysts 
composed of two metals). We found 
90 
by John H. Sinfelt 
that in situations where a molecule can 
undergo several different reactions bi­
metallic catalysts often eliminate un­
desirable reactions and maximize the 
desired one. We also found that two 
metallic elements can form an effec­
tive bimetallic catalyst even if they do 
not mix with each other to form an 
alloy. Finally, we discovered a new 
class of catalysts containing bimetallic 
clusters. The clusters are often 10 to 
50 angstrom units in size (an angstrom 
unit is a ten-billionth of a meter). 
Bimetallic clusters have already had 
a major impact on petroleum refin­
ing. We found that a catalyst contain­
ing platinum-iridium clusters leads to 
a higher rate of formation of high­
octane-number gasoline components 
(aromatic hydrocarbons such as tolu­
ene and xylenes) than do earlier cata­
lysts containing pure platinum clus­
ters. The higher the octane number of 
a gasoline, the greater the resistance 
to "knock" in.an internal-combustion 
engine. Knock is a detonation that in­
terferes with the smooth combustion 
of the fuel; the result is a decrease in 
the power output of the engine. Aug­
menting the amount of aromatic hy­
drocarbons in gasoline provides an al­
ternative to the use of tetraethyl lead 
for obtaining high octane numbers. 
Our bimetallic catalyst, both by itself 
and in combination with other cata­
lysts, has consequently been a key fac­
tor in making "low lead" and "lead­
free" gasolines feasible. 
T
hroughout the course of our work 
we have employed a form of catal­
ysis known as heterogeneous catalysis, 
in which the reacting molecules are 
present in a phase separate from that 
of the catalyst. (In homogeneous catal­
ysis, in contrast, the catalyst and the 
reacting molecules are present in the 
same phase, commonly in a liquid so­
lution.) In a typical situation in hetero­
geneous catalysis a fluid phase (often 
a gas) flows through a bed of catalyst 
particles. One widely employed type 
of catalyst consists of particles of a 
porous material, known as a carrier, 
in which submicroscopic metal clus­
ters are embedded. Depending on the 
application, the particles could range 
in size from a couple of tenths of a mil­
limeter to several millimeters. The 
material constituting the bulk of the 
particles is often an oxide such as alu­
mina (AhOs) or silica (Si02) contain­
ing a network of pores. The pores have 
an average diameter of about 100 ang­
stroms. The metal clusters reside on 
the walls of the pores and therefore 
must be smaller than the pores. 
As the gas flows through the cata­
lyst bed, reactant molecules diffuse 
into the pores of the particles and are 
adsorbed onto the surfaces of the met­
al clusters. In the chemisorption, or 
chemical adsorption, of a reactant 
molecule on a metal cluster, a chemi­
cal bond forms between the molecule 
and a surface site. A site may consist of 
a single atom or an array of atoms. 
Where an array of atoms is involved 
the atoms may be of a single element, 
as they are in a pure-metal cluster. Al­
ternatively the array could consist of 
more than one type of atom, as in the 
case of a bimetallic cluster, for exam­
ple. The chemisorption process forms 
a surface compound. 
The surface compound then under­
goes chemical transformations on the 
clusters to yield molecules of a differ­
ent chemical species, which are sub­
sequently desorbed (the process of 
adsorption in reverse). The product 
molecules then diffuse out through the 
network of pores into the gas stream 
flowing through the empty space be­
tween the particles. The desorption of 
a product molecule from the metal 
cluster releases a site for further par­
ticipation in the reaction. The active 
catalyst sites are used repeatedly in the 
reaction. The composition of the gas

PLATINUM-IRIDIUM CLUSTERS appear as black dots in an 
electron micrograph of a catalyst in which the clusters are dispersed 
throughout granules of a highly porous aluminum oxide. The clus­
ters are employed in the production from petrochemicals of aro­
matic hydrocarbons (ring-shaped molecules) that inhibit knock in 
internal-combustion engines. Each cluster is a bimetallic catalyst, an 
agent composed of two metals that facilitates chemical reactions. 
The clusters measure about 10 angstrom units (an angstrom unit is 
a ten-billionth of a meter). The light egg-shaped region in the cen­
ter of the image is a hole in the mount on which the sample rested.

lines. Metal c1nsters reside on the walls of the pores (right). Molecnles diffnse throngh the 
pores, where they adhere to the surface of the clusters. The adsorbed molecules then under­
go chemical transformations on the clusters to yield molecules of different chemical spe­
cies. Molecules of the chemical product diffuse out through the pores. Since the clusters 
are not consumed in the process, they can be ·utilized for many chemical transformations.

HYDROCARBON REACTIONS are important both in the characterization of metallic 
and bimetallic catalysts and in the production of petroleum products. One such chemical 
transformation is the hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons (top). In this class of reactions car­
bon-carbon bonds in hydrocarbons are ruptured and hydrogen is incorporated to form new 
hydrocarbons. An example is the reaction between ethane and hydrogen that produces 
methane. Another important class of reactions is the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (bot­
tom), which consists in rupturing carbon-hydrogen bonds and removing hydrogen. The de­
hydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene and hydrogen is an example of this kind of reac­
tion. The reaction rates for both the hydrogenolysis of ethane and the dehydrogenation of 
cYclohexane depend on the composition of the catalyst employed. The two reactions there­
fore serve as useful chemical probes. Dehydrogenation is also employed in the production 
of aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraxylene) that have excellent antiknock proJlerties.

stream changes in its passage through 
the catalyst bed as the gas is'depleted 
of molecules of reactant and enriched 
in molecules of product. The perform­
ance of a catalyst in facilitating this 
chemical change has been customarily 
referred to as its activity. 
In developing an understanding of 
the general factors that influence cata­
lytic activities of metals, one can gain 
insight by studying a given reaction 
over a series of metals. A good exam­
ple is found in comparing the catalytic 
activities of metals for the hydrogenol­
ysis of hydrocarbons. That. reaction 
consists in rupturing the carbon-car­
bon bonds of hydrocarbons and add­
ing hydrogen to form, new hydro­
carbons, The simplest example is the 
reaction between one molecule of 
ethane (C2HS) and one molecule of 
hydrogen (H2) to form two molecules 
of methane (CH4). Sir Hugh Taylor 
and his colleagues at Princeton Uni­
versity originally investigated this re­
action on nickel, cobalt and iron cata­
lysts. At the Exxon laboratories we 
extended the work to a number of oth­
er metals and observed dramatic varia­
tions in the levels of their activity. 
O
ur investigation of the hydrogen­
olysis activities of metal catalysts 
affords a good background for selec­
tivity studies of bimetallic catalysts. 
The periodic table of elements pro­
vided a framework for our studies. 
The elements in the periodic table are 
arranged in vertical columns called 
groups and in horizontal rows called 
periods. Elements in a given group 
tend to show similar chemical behav­
ior whereas those in a given period ex­
hibit a systematic variation of proper­
ties across the period. It is instructive 
to consider how hydrogenolysis activi­
ty varies from one metal to another 
within such a period. 
We measured the activities of met­
als in three periods that include the 
first, second and third transition series, 
focusing our attention on the metals 
in group VIlA through group VIII to 
group lB. Since group VIII has three 
subgroups, designated VIII!> VIII2 and 
VIII3, each of the transition series con­
tains three metals within this group. 
We obtained the most complete set of 
data on hydrogenolytic activities for 
metals of the third transition series. In 
this series osmium, a member of sub­
group VIII!> has the highest activity, 
The activity of platinum, a member of 
subgroup VIII3, is eight orders of mag­
nitude lower than the activity of osmi­
um, and the activity of iridium, a mem­
ber of subgroup VIII 
2, falls between 
the extremes. Precise data on the activ­
ity of gold, the group IB metal immedi­
ately following platinum in this series, 
© 1985 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC
are not available. It is known, however, 
that gold is much less active than plati­
num for hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis 
reactions in general. 
In the second transition series we 
found a similar variation in activity 
ranging from ruthenium through pal­
ladium (group VIII members) to silver 
(a group lB member). The pattern of 
variation in the first transition series, 
however, differs from the pattern of 
the second and third series. We ob­
served that the activity of nickel, a 
member of subgroup VIII3, is higher 
than that of iron, a member of sub­
group VIII 
l' The activity of copper 
(the group IB metal following nickel), 
however, is much lower than that of 
nickel. This result is in agreement with 
the pattern of the other two series. 
A qualitative understanding of the 
pattern of variation follows from a 
principle that relates catalytic activity 
to both the ease with which a mole­
cule of reactant binds to a catalyst 
(chemisorption) and the strength of the 
chemisorption bond. The catalytic ac­
tivity reaches a maxim 
um when a reac­
tant molecule is rapidly adsorbed but 
its bond with the catalyst is only mod­
erately strong. If the chem 
isorption 
bond is too strong, the adsorbed mole­
cule will not undergo a reaction. Even 
if a reaction occurs, the prod 
uct will 
not readily desorb from the surface. 
Metals exhibiting these qualities in­
clude most of the members of groups 
VIA and VIlA (such as manganese, 
chromium and tungsten), which im­
mediately precede the group VIII met­
als in the periodic table. 
A bond that is too weak can also 
frustrate catalysis. Metals often exhib­
iting this quality include all the mem­
bers of group IB (copper, silver and 
gold). Chemisorption may also take 
place too slowly. Since the metals in 
group VIII rapidly adsorb molecules 
and allow reaction to occur, they are 
particularly important in catalysis. 
After completing our investigation 
I\. of ethane hydrogenolysis on met­
als, we began examining the selectivity 
of bimetallic catalysts. We studied the 
hydrogenolytic activities of bimetallic 
catalysts consisting of a highly active· 
group VIII metal in combination with 
an inactive group IB metal. To deter­
mine whether the effect of a group IB 
metal on the catalytic activity of a 
group VIII metal depends on the type 
of reaction, we included a second reac­
tion in the investigation, the dehydro­
genation of hydrocarbons. In contrast 
to hydrogenolysis, this reaction con­
sists in rupturing the carbon-hydrogen 
bonds of hydrocarbons and removing 
hydrogen, a process that leads to the 
formation of other hydrocarbons. Spe-

CATALYTIC SPECIFICITY is strikingly 
illustrated by the wide range in the ability 
of metal catalysts to enhance the hydrogen­
olysis of ethane to methane. Each graph cor­
responds to one of the three transition series 
of the periodic table of elements (left). The 
horizontal axes of the graphs indicate the rel­

tion series. The vertical axes denote the spe­
cific activity of each element with respect to

of the group IB metals (copper and silver) 
are many orders of magnitude lower than 
those of such group VIII metals as nickel,

cifically we considered the dehydro­
genation 
of 
cyclohexane 
(CsHd, 
which yields one molecule of benzene 
(C6H6) and three molecules of hydro­
gen per cyclohexane molecule. 
The first bimetallic system we inves­
tigated was nickel-copper. Nickel and 
copper mix with each other to form 
alloys. We investigated the catalytic 
activities at 316 degrees Celsius of a 
series of nickel-copper alloys of vary­
ing composition. These alloys, unlike 
clusters, were not high-surface-area 
materials. Rather they were in the 
form of metal powders in which ap­
proximately one atom in a thousand 
was a surface atom. 
Before considering the activities of 
nickel-copper alloys for hydrogenoly­
sis and dehydrogenation reactions, it is 
important to realize that the surface 
composition of a nickel-copper alloy 
differs in general from the bulk com­
position. Copper tends to concentrate 
markedly in the surface of nickel-cop­
per alloys. Even a nickel-copper al­
loy containing only a small amount 
of copper still has a surface dominated 
by an abundance of copper atoms. 
The effect of copper on the activi­
ty of nickel for ethane hydrogenolysis 
differs greatly from its effect on the 
activity for cyclohexane dehydrogen­
ation. The hydrogenolytic activity of 
catalysts in which copper atoms ac­
count for only 5 percent of the total 
number of atoms is a thousandfold less 
than the activity of pure nickel. As we 
increased the copper content, the hy­
drogenolytic activity decreased con­
tinuously. In contrast, the activity of 
nickel for dehydrogenation of cyclo- -
hexane is affected very little over a 
wide range of composition, and it ac-

PERCENTAGE OF COPPER ATOMS IN NICKEL-COPPER CATALYST 
BIMETALLIC CATALYSTS composed of nickel (a group VIII metal) and copper (a group 
IB metal) in varying ratios have different effects on the rates of dehydrogenation and hy­
drogenolysis. (Compared with nickel, copper is an ineffective catalyst for either reaction.) 
The horizontal axis indicates the percentage of copper atoms in the nickel-copper cata­
lysts. The vertical axis indicates the activity of the catalysts. The dehydrogenation of cyclo­
hexane (colored curve) is affected only slightly by the addition of copper to nickel nntil 80 
percent of the catalyst consists of copper. The hydrogenolysis of ethane (black curve), in 
contrast, decreases sharply as the amount of copper in the cluster increases. A group IB met­
al such as copper will generally suppress the hydrogenolytic activity of a group VIII metal; 
its influence on dehydrogenation activity is much smaller. Consequently the selectivity for 
dehydrogenation can be enhanced at the expense of competing hydrogenolytic reactions. 
94 
tually increased as we added the first 
. increments of copper to nickel. Only 
when the composition of the catalyst 
approached pure copper did we' ob­
serve a marked decline in dehydrogen­
ation activity. 
We found another example of a se­
lectivity effect with ruthenium-copper 
catalysts. On pure ruthenium, cyclo­
hexane dehydrogenates to form ben­
zene, but it also undergoes extensive 
hydrogenolysis to yield small alkane 
molecules such as methane. The incor­
poration of copper with ruthenium 
inhibits the hydrogenolysis reaction 
while allowing the dehydrogenation 
reaction. The selectivity of the con­
version of cyclohexane into benzene 
therefore improves markedly. The ru­
thenium-copper catalyst is particular­
ly interesting because the copper at­
oms do not intermix in the bulk with 
the ruthenium atoms. Instead the cop­
per atoms sit on top of the ruthenium 
surface layer, and ruthenium-copper 
bonds are present at the interface. 
The presence of copper can there­
fore influence-the selectivity of a group 
VIII metal whether or not the copper 
mixes with the metal. My colleagues 
and I also observed selective inhibition 
of the hydrogenolysis activity of group 
VIII metals when we substituted gold 
or silver for copper. In general we have 
found that a group IB metal suppresses 
the hydrogenolysis activity of a group 
VIII metal and improves its selectivity 
for catalyzing such reactions as the de­
hydrogenation and isomerization of 
hydrocarbons. Findings reported by a 
group of workers in the Netherlands 
led by W. M. H. Sachtler and V. Ponec 
corroborate our work. 
M
y colleagues and I also obtained 
significant res 
ults in the aspect of 
our research concerned with the prep­
aration and characterization of bi­
metallic clusters. In approaching this 
problem we explored the possibility of 
preparing very small alloy crystallites. 
Since pairs of metallic elements that 
do not intermix can exhibit significant 
interactions for catalysis, however, it 
did not seem appropriate to use the 
term alloy catalysts when referring to 
bimetallic catalysts in general. A term 
such as bimetallic aggregates seemed 
preferable to alloys. After working for 
some time on the techniq 
ue of dispers­
ing bimetallic aggregates on carriers, I 
introduced the term bimetallic cluster. 
Clusters typically range in size from 
10 to 50 angstroms. Sometimes they 
are so small that virtually every atom 
in a cluster is a surface atom. 
We first prepared ruthenium-cop­
per clusters. We wetted silica with 
an aqueous solution of ruthenium and 
© 1985 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC
copper salts. By drying the resulting 
material and treating it with hydro­
gen at elevated temperatures (400 to 
600 degrees C.) we produced rutheni­
um-copper clusters on the silica. 
When we began our work in the ear­
ly 1960's, we wanted evidence that 
we were producing actual bimetallic 
clusters instead of monometallic clus­
ters of pure ruthenium and copper. At 
that time the ability of physical meth­
ods to obtain structural information 
on such systems limited direct exper­
imental verification of the presence 
of bimetallic clusters. To obtain evi­
dence for interaction between the two 
metallic components we exploited our 
earlier work on bimetallic catalysts 
prepared without a carrier. The hydro­
genolysis of ethane to methane proved 
an ideal chemical probe of clusters be­
cause the addition of a group IB metal 
to a group VIII metal suppresses the 
hydrogenolytic activity of the group 
VIII metal. The absence of such sup­
pression would have suggested that 
the two metallic elements had not 
formed bimetallic clusters. We found 
significant 
evidence 
for 
interaction 
not only between ruthenium and cop­
per but also between other group VIII 
and group IB metals 
. 
. In recent years advances in X-ray­
absorption spectroscopy have provid­
ed workers with a valuable physical 
probe for obtaining information on the 
structures of bimetallic clusters; the 
knowledge gained supplements what 
has been learned by means of chemical 
probes. When one exposes a sample of 
material to a beam of X rays, the ex­
tent of absorption of the X rays de­
pends on the thickness of the sample 
and the X-ray energy. Absorption oc­
curs when an X ray excites an electron 
of an absorbing atom from a low ener­
gy state to a high energy state. If the X­
ray energy is high enough, it will eject 
the electron (known as a photoelec­
tron) from the atom. At such an X­
ray energy the absorption increases 
sharply, producing an absorption edge. 
When the X-ray energy exceeds the en­
ergy req 
uired to detach electrons in a 
given state from an atom, the photo­
electrons retain the excess energy as 
kinetic energy. 
As one increases the X-ray energy 
beyond the threshold required to pro­
duce photoelectrons, the kinetic ener­
gy of the photoelectrons increases and 
absorption of the X rays decreases. 
The decline in absorption persists until 
the energy of the X rays becomes high 
enough to excite electrons out of the 
next-lower energy state characteristic 
of atoms in the sample material. At 
such an X-ray energy one observes an­
other absorption edge. As the X-ray

X-RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY is useful in the characterization of clusters. A 
beam of X rays is directed at the catalyst being probed. When the energy of the X-ray beam 
is great enough to separate an electron from an atom, an abrupt increase in X-ray absorp­
tion occurs. Such an energy level (called an absorption edge) characterizes an element. Ru­
thenium-copper clusters (top illustratioll) exhibit an absorption edge at an energy slightly 
greater than 22,000 electron volts. Generally elements have a series of absorption edges. 
The graph for platinum-iridium clusters (bottom illustratioll) displays six absorption edges, 
which lie between 11,000 and 14,000 electron volts. For X-ray energies greater than those 
corresponding to the absorption edges, the absorption coefficient fluctuates. Analysis of 
the fluctuations characteristic of ruthenium-copper clusters indicates that actual bimetal­
lic clusters are formed, as opposed to monometallic clusters of the individual elements. In 
the case of platinum-iridium the fluctuations following a so-called L absorption edge (such 
as Lm) indicate that the clusters are not uniform mixtures of platinum and iridium atoms.

PLATINUM-IRIDIUM CLUSTERS are more efficient than platinum clusters in the pro­
duction of gasoline components having a high octane number. After several hundred hours 
of use (hours on stream) the platinum-iridium clusters (colored curve) yield a product of 
significantly higher octane number than that obtained with a platinum catalyst (black curve). 
The performance of the platinum clusters declines as time passes. The comparison shown 
was conducted at a temperature of 487 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 14.6 atmospheres. 
energy increases beyond a value that 
corresponds to the absorption edge the 
absorption decreases again. 
Absorption in the region following 
an absorption edge does not decrease 
smoothly as X-ray energy increases: 
photoelectron scattering effects give 
rise to fluctuations. Analysis of this 
extended X-ray-absorption fine struc­
ture provides a measure of both the 
distances between the constituent at­
oms and the number of neighboring 
atoms of a particular kind that sur­
round an absorber atom. 
B
ecause X-ray-absorption studies ap­
peared to offer a promising way 
to investigate bimetallic catalysts, I 
collaborated in the mid-1970's in a se­
ries of such studies with Grayson H. 
Via and Farrel W. Lytle. Working at 
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation 
Laboratory, we obtained strong sup­
porting evidence for the presence of 
ruthenium-copper and osmium-cop­
per bimetallic clusters in silica-sup­
ported catalysts containing low con­
centrations of these elements. In the 
analysis of the fine structure associat­
ed with absorption edges of copper, 
ruthenium and osmium, we found 
that copper atoms bind extensively to 
ruthenium or osmium atoms as well 
as to other copper atoms. Ruthenium 
and osmium atoms, on the other hand, 
96 
have very few neighboring copper at­
oms as opposed to atoms of their own 
kind. The results agree with those ob­
tained from experiments with chem­
ical probes: a cluster apparently con­
sists of a core of ruthenium or osmium 
atoms surrounded by a surface layer of 
copper atoms. 
X-ray-absorption spectroscopy also 
proved useful in our investigation of 
platinum-iridium clusters. We worked 
with these clusters because we were 
interested in substituting them for the 
platinum clusters originally employed 
in the production of high-octane gaso­
line components. 
Analysis of extended X-ray-absorp­
tion fine structure reveals inhomoge­
neity among platinum-iridium clus­
ters. It can be concluded either that the 
ratio of platinum to iridium varies 
from cluster to cluster or that plati­
num- and iridium-rich regions may ex­
ist within a given metal cluster. Sur­
face-energy considerations support the 
latter interpretation. Since platinum 
should have a lower surface energy 
than iridium, my colleagues and I sug­
gest that a platinum-rich region should 
exist on the surface. An iridium-rich 
region would then constitute the cen­
tral core of the cluster, so that a com­
position gradient would exist from the 
inside to the 0 u 
tside of the cluster. 
In view of the theory that platinum 
concentrates on the surface of plati­
mlm-iridium clusters, one would ex­
pect that platinum and iridium would 
increasingly segregate from each other 
as the clusters become smaller and the 
ratio of surface atoms to total metal 
atoms increases. When the ratio equals 
one-half for clusters containing SO per­
cent each of platinum and iridium, for 
instance, one might even find all the 
platinum on the surface and all the irid­
ium in the interior. When the ratio ap­
proaches unity, complete segregation 
cannot be achieved if the clusters are 
spheres. Such segregation is possible, 
however, if the clusters have a two­
dimensional "raftlike" shape. The pe­
rimeter of a central iridium or iridium­
rich raft would then be studded with 
platinum atoms. 
P
latinum-iridium clusters have a 
higher performance in petroleum 
reforming than platinum clusters. Re­
forming is a process in which certain 
hydrocarbons are converted into high­
octane-number 
hydrocarbons. 
The 
performance of platinum decreases 
substantially during use because car­
bonaceous residues, which are charac­
teristic by-products of high-temper­
ature petroleum processes, foul the 
surfaces of the clusters. The accumu­
lation of the residues on platinum-irid­
ium clusters is less than the accumula­
tion on platinum. One reason is that 
iridium is much more active than plat­
inum for the hydrogenolysis of the res­
idues or the precursors of the residues, 
and it therefore limits their buildup. 
Increased hydrogenolysis, however, 
can also lead to increased rates of con­
version of hydrocarbons into light 
gaseous products. A catalyst contain­
ing iridium alone increases the yield of 
these low-value substances. In the case 
of platinum-iridium catalysts, howev­
er, the interaction of platinum and 
iridium moderates the hydrogenolytic 
activity of iridium. At the conditions 
employed in reforming (temperatures 
near 500 degrees C. and pressures of 
15 to 30 atmospheres), the inclusion of 
iridium with platinum increases the 
production of valuable gasoline com­
ponents to about the same extent as it 
increases the production of light gas­
eous products. One consequently ob­
tains a satisfactory distribution of re­
action products at a high rate. 
In the years since its first commercial 
application in 1971, the platinum-irid­
ium catalyst has been employed in 
many Exxon reforming units through­
out the world. In the early stages of the 
work I received a great deal of help 
from two very able co-workers, James 
L. Carter and Allen E. Barnett. At a 
later stage many individ

ous parts of Exxon made contributions 
to the commercialization of the cata­
lyst, which has also been employed by 
some other companies under license 
from Exxon. 
My colleagues and I have combined 
our catalyst with another reforming 
catalyst consisting of platinum and 
rhenium supported on alumina. The 
Chevron Corporation developed this 
catalyst. The platinum-rhenium com­
bination differs from the types of bi­
metallic catalysts discussed above in 
that rhenium is a metallic element 
from group VIlA of the periodic table. 
Platinum-rhenium catalysts are par­
ticularly effective for the selective con­
version of cycloalkanes (saturated hy­
drocarbon rings) into aromatic hy­
drocarbons (unsaturated hydrocarbon 
rings), whereas platinum-iridium cat­
alysts are highly active for the conver­
sion of noncyclic alkanes into aromat­
ics. An unsaturated hydrocarbon ring 
contains less hydrogen than a saturat­
ed hydrocarbon ring. 
Since the aromatization, or forma-
tion, of cycloalkanes occurs much 
more readily than the aromatization 
of noncyclic alkanes, a reforming sys­
tem conveniently divides into two sep­
arate regions. The aromatization of cy­
cloalkanes occurs primarily in the 
first region, whereas the aromatiza­
tion of noncyclic alkanes occurs pre­
dominantly in the second. Consequent­
ly one can employ a platinum-rhenium 
catalyst in the first region and a plati­
num-iridium catalyst in the second. In 
practice a reformer consists of a num­
ber of reactors in series. The initial re­
actors can be filled with a platinum­
rhenium catalyst and the tail reactors 
with a platinum-iridium catalyst. 
Petroleum refineries employing a 
combined catalyst system obtain the 
advantages of both types of catalyst 
in a single operation. A number of 
commercial reforming units use com­
bined catalyst systems of the type de­
scribed here. Several factors, includ­
ing the activity of the catalyst system 
and the yields of the various products 
obtained with it, affect the choice of 
a catalyst system. The relative impor­
tance of the different factors a.nd hence 
the economic analysis depend on the 
particular application. 
T
he application of bimetallic cat­
alysts in the petroleum industry 
has been widespread. The catalysts cur­
rently in use have exhibited outstand­
ing performance in refineries through­
out the world. Research on bimetallic 
catalysts continues. Although the work 
in this area has already had a major 
impact on the reforming process, it is 
very likely that improvements of exist­
ing systems will emerge as a result of 
further work. Moreover, the outlook 
for applications of bimetallic clusters 
in reaction systems other than reform­
ing would appear to be excellent in 
view of the many possible combina­
tions of metallic elements. The exten­
sion to polymetallic clusters (clusters 
containing more than two metallic 
elements) offers the possibility of even 
greater flexibility in the design of cat­
alytic systems. 
FIVE CATALYTIC REACTORS at the Imperial Oil, Ltd., refinery 
in Strathcona, Canada, produce high-octane gasoline components. 
The reactors (green) are filled with granules containing platinum­
iridium clusters. A vaporized petroleum fraction is admitted into 
the first reactor. The effluent from that reactor is subsequently re­
heated and passed into the second reactor, and so on down the line. 
The final product is rich in high-octane gasoline components. The

A new technigue may expand the use of lasers in commercial and military applications. The approach, 
called optical phase conjugation, is considered a major advance in optics because it offers a solution to 
distortion problems that have limited the use of lasers. When a laser beam passes through a turbulent 
atmosphere or a severely strained optical component, the beam is distorted and the information it 
carries is degraded. The Hughes Aircraft Company technique, however, forces the laser to retrace its 
path through the distorting medium so the beam emerges free of distortion. The method eliminates the 
need for complex electro-optical and mechanical components to correct the distortions. 
Pilots of future aircraft may rely on artificial intelligence systems to help them assess combat situations 
and take appropriate offensive or defensive actions. Hughes engineers are conducting studies for the 
U. S. Air Force on potential uses of artificial intelligence for fire control and battle management. One 
focus is how to identify targets automatically and present this information for a pilot's use. Another 
aspect involves tactical analysis, including decision-making that advises a pilot whether to attack, flee, 
apply electronic countermeasures, or fly low-altitude routes. New automation techniques may be 
necessary for pilots to cope with the fire control systems that now are being designed for the next 
generation of military aircraft. 
The first attempt to sample the atmosphere of an outer planet, NASA's Project Galileo will journey 750 
million miles to Jupiter this decade. The mission will consist of two spacecraft, an orbiter and a 
Hughes-built probe. Six instruments inside the probe's descent module will assess the structure and 
composition of the atmosphere, determine the location and structure of clouds, calibrate a precise ratio 
of hydrogen and helium, and measure lightning, radio emission, and energy absorption. The probe will 
transmit data to the orbiter for relay to Earth. Project Galileo will be the first interplanetary vehicle 
launched from the space shuttle. The launch is set for May 1986 and arrival for August 1988. Four 
Hughes-built probes explored the atmosphere of Venus in 1978. 
High-energy laser pointing and tracking systems are among the advanced electro-optical systems 
supported by the Albuquerque Engineering Center in New Mexico. The center's scientific disciplines 
include physics, optics, mathematics, lasers, image processing, electro-optical control systems, and 
computer science. Programs involve electro-optical sensors for strategic military applications, 
including work performed at the U. S. Air Force W
eapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base and 
the White Sands Missile Range. The Hughes center is expected to expand from its current staff of 42 
highly trained professionals to greater than 100 over the next three years.

Would you like to know how com­
puters can tell the difference 
between a pair in a poker game and 
a pear on a plate? 
How they can understand a vari­
ety of speakers with a diverse 
variety of accents-and reply in 
pear-shaped tones, using normally 
connected speech? 
Then read on to learn more about 
computers that recognize words, 
comprehend meaning from context, 
even synthesize human speech from 
a mere shadow of itself. 
It's All In The Algorithms 
Utilizing three levels of speech­
processing algorithms, AT&T is 
giving the computer a more 'robust' 
understanding-the capacity to 
comprehend connected speech from 
different speakers. 
Acoustic pattern 
matching (1) iden­
tifies the spoken 
words. 
Grammatical pro­
cessing (2) figures 
out how the words 
are put together. 
And semantic 
processing (3) extracts meaning 
from the context. With each suc­
cessive step, the computer moves 
closer to accurate understanding. 
Acoustic pattern matching deter­
mines how much latitude the wave­
form (pronunciation) of a word can 
have before it becomes unintelligible 
to the computer. 
By isolating the specific charac­
teristics the waveform of a word con­
tains-independent of the accent of a 
speaker-we increase the probability 
that it will be correctly matched to 
a pattern stored in a computer's 
memory
. But, correct recognition of 
words is only the beginning of com­
puter understanding. 
Computer Grammar 101 
Grammatical processing further 
increases the probability of recogniz­
ing words. It analyzes them within 
the constraints imposed by lan­
guage-the allowable sequences of 
syllables in a word or words in a 
sentence. 
For a specific vocabulary and sit­
uation, it is possible to define every 
© 1985 AT&T Technologies, Inc. 
sequence the computer can recog­
nize. Based on probabilities assigned 
to each word it recognizes-and 
where that word falls-the computer 
determines which of its possible 
sequences is the most likely
. This 
process gains two advantages: It 
allows words that might not other­
wise be recognized to be correctly 
accepted; and it speeds up process­
ing time by using sequence position 
to limit the number of words it looks 
at for a pattern match. 
A Meaningful Relationship 
Semantic processing is the point 
where the computer crosses the line 
between recognition and under­
standing-the point where words are 
given meaning within a specific con­
text. This endows a system with one 
of its most human qualities: knowing 
when a request isn't understood, and 
asking for appropriate clarification. 
Talk Isn't Cheap 
Making a computer listen intel­
ligently is one thing; making it 
respond intelligibly, however, is 
another. 
Enabling a computer to talk, 
reproducing the subtleties of human 
speech, has required large amounts 
of memory-a high cost item. There­
fore, an 85 percent reduction in 
the amount of information needed to 
store and generate high-quality 
speech can mean significant cost 
reductions. 
That's just what a new AT&T 
speech synthesis technique, called 
multi-pulse linear predictive coding 
(MP-LPC), provides. It reduces the 
64 thousand bits per second pre­
viously needed to 96 hundred. 
Speech signals mimic the human 
vocal tract-they have redundancies 
built in. MP-LPC codes speech to 
remove these redundancies, then 
tells the computer how to recon­
stitute the original speech from the 
mini-version in its memory
. This cod­
ing eliminates unnecessary bits from 
being stored and transmitted. 
Getting Down 'Ib Business 
At AT&T, our goal is to make 
computers listen and understand 
as fast as people speak-and 
speak to and understand as many 
people as possible. Speech-
processing algorithms, developed by 
AT&T Bell Laboratories, have moved 
us several steps closer to that ideal. 
For example, most speech recog­
nition systems make the speaker 
pause between words. But AT&T, 
using advanced recognition algo­
rithms, has developed a Stock 
Quotation System, now in field trial, 
that allows callers to enter and 
retrieve current market information 
in natural, normally-connected 
speech. Users simply speak the 
number codes for any of over 6,000 
stocks, and the service provides cur­
rent quotes-delivered in computer­
generated speech. 
Numbers are nice, but make for 
limited conversation. Closer to our 
goal of a conversational computer is 
the Flight Information System. It 
uses the Official Airline Guide as its 
data base. In its limited environ­
ment, this laboratory system con­
verses with the user in natural 
speech in response to normal flight 
information queries. 
One Of Our First Callings 
AT&T has been deeply involved in 
speech technology since the genesis 
of the telephone. F rom the begin­
ning, our goal was to make mechan­
ical communications fast, foolproof 
and economical. 
Today, with the advent ofthe com­
puter, we're moving toward the ulti­
mate ideal: creating machines that 
serve our needs and save our energy 
in the most natural manner-by voice 
command.
