Rapid deactivation often reduces the effectiveness of Pt-group catalysts in the low-temperature aerobic
oxidation of alcohols. Here, we report the use of thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as activity
promoters in the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) under low air pressure; the oxida-
tion rate was signiﬁcantly improved, particularly at high conversion, in contrast to the frequently
observed activity decrease induced by SAM modiﬁcation in hydrogenation reactions. Reaction studies
indicated that in the regime of low air pressure, catalyst deactivation was mainly caused by the carbona-
ceous poisons generated from the reaction product 2-hexenal (HAL). Infrared spectroscopy revealed that
HAL produced surface residues on Pd that poisoned the catalyst, hypothetically through decarbonylation
and dimerization. This poisoning can be suppressed by the SAM modiﬁers, in a manner that was control-
lable by varying thiolate surface coverage through use of either 1-adamantanethiol (AT) or 1-
octadecanethiol (C18) SAMs.

1. Introduction
The selective oxidation of alcohols is a critical component of
ﬁne chemical and pharmaceutical production [1]. Heterogeneous
Pt-group catalysts, known for their ability to activate molecular
oxygen and alcohols, have been widely investigated for low-
temperature aerobic oxidation under environmentally benign and
industry-favorable conditions [2,3]. However, the commercial
applicability of these catalysts is often limited by rapid deactiva-
tion. Possible deactivation routes include metal leaching and sin-
tering [4], and ‘‘over-oxidation” of active sites when the surface
coverage of oxygen is too high [5,6]. Under low oxygen pressure,
on the other hand, surface poisoning by strongly adsorbed inter-
mediates frequently has been reported to cause deactivation in
the oxidation of primary and unsaturated alcohols [7,8].
It is generally accepted that adsorbed aldehyde is produced on
the catalyst surface during alcohol oxidation; the aldehyde can
desorb or decompose to CO and carbonaceous intermediates. The
presence of these surface residues can cause catalyst deactivation
by blocking active sites. A number of studies have investigated
aldehyde degradation during alcohol oxidation, in both ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) and at the liquid-solid interface [8–11]. The classic
decomposition pathways for unsaturated alcohols, as measured in
UHV conditions on single crystal surfaces such as Pd(111), involve
dehydrogenation to aldehydes followed primarily by decarbonyla-
tion to produce CO and hydrocarbon fragments; however, other
pathways, including deoxygenation, have also been observed [9–
11]. Consistent with UHV studies, aldehyde decarbonylation has
been frequently reported in the liquid phase oxidation of aromatic
and allylic alcohols such as benzyl, cinnamyl, and crotyl alcohols
[8,12–14], and has been attributed as a source of catalyst poisoning
species.
Recent work has indicated that thiolate self-assembled mono-
layers (SAMs) can be used as catalyst modiﬁers to control the reac-
tivity of noble metal catalysts in a number of hydrogenation
reactions [15–18]. Most frequently, the improvement of selectivity
to the desired products was obtained at the expense of a lowered
activity, due to site blocking by the SAM modiﬁer. In certain cases,
thiolate SAMs have been shown to reduce the coverage of carbona-
ceous coke that blocks active sites and thus improve catalytic
activity, but the detailed mechanism remained unclear [17,18].
One advantage of SAMs-based modiﬁers over other modiﬁcation
techniques is that their self-limiting surface coverage can be tuned
in a straightforward way, by varying the tail structure [19]. For
example, to create a dense SAM, the long-chain alkanethiol 1-
octadecanethiol (C18) precursor can be applied, which creates a
ðp3  p3Þ R30 structure on Pd(111) [20], whereas a sparser

SAM can be obtained by using the bulky-tailed 1-adamantanethiol
(AT) [21,22]. To date, thiolate SAMs have not been investigated as
surface modiﬁers on Pt-group catalysts for oxidation reactions,
though they have been used as capping ligands for Au nanoparti-
cles used in oxidation [23].
As an important category of alcohols, a number of a, b-
unsaturated alcohols of different lengths have been investigated
for selective oxidation, varying from allyl alcohol to 2-decenol
[24–26]. Here, trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) was used as the probe
molecule for linear unsaturated alcohols. Using AT and C18 SAM
modiﬁcation, we successfully limited the deactivation of a sup-
ported palladium catalyst during aerobic oxidation of HOL while
maintaining the desired selectivity to the corresponding aldehyde
trans-2-hexen-1-al (HAL). Kinetic studies combined with infrared
spectroscopy analysis were used to investigate the role of the thi-
olate SAMs in controlling the formation of the surface poisoning
species and preventing catalyst deactivation.
2. Materials and experimental methods
2.1. Materials
The 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, 1-adamantanethiol (95%), 1-
octadecanethiol (98%), heptane (99%), trans-2-hexen-1-ol (96%),
trans-2-hexenal (98%), and 200-proof ethanol were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Catalysts received were used for reaction
studies without further treatments. Zero-grade air, ultra-high pur-
ity H2, O2, He, and Ar were obtained from Airgas.
2.2. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The surface area and the dispersion of commercial Pd/Al2O3 cat-
alyst were characterized by CO adsorption using a Micromeritics
ChemiSorb 2720 system. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst
was pretreated in situ by 1-h oxidation in air and 3-h reduction
in H2 at 120 C, followed by 1-h purging with He at the same tem-
perature. CO adsorption was performed at room temperature. The
measurement gave an active surface area of (3.0 ± 0.5) m2/g and a
dispersion of (20 ± 4)%, consistent with previously reported num-
bers [16,27]. The Pd particle size was measured by TEM as
(3.3 ± 0.5) nm (see Figs. S1 and S2 for representative TEM images).
The thiolate SAM coated catalysts were prepared by immersing
the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts into a 1 mM thiolate solution in ethanol.
After 16 h, the ethanol supernatant was poured off and the catalyst
was immersed in pure ethanol (for AT modiﬁer) or hexane (for C18
modiﬁer) for 3 h to remove any physisorbed thiol molecules. The
supernatant was then poured off and the catalyst was dried in a
vacuum desiccator for 30–60 min.
The freshly-prepared thiolate SAM on the catalyst was well-
ordered, as indicated by diffuse reﬂectance Fourier transform infra-
red spectroscopy (DRIFTS) (Fig. S3), which showed methylene
stretching frequencies consistent with organized SAMs. The sur-
face area of the modiﬁed catalyst was measured by CO chemisorp-
tion after an in situ pretreatment (3-h reduction in 20 sccm H2 and
1-h purging with 20 sccm He at 120 C). Compared to the native
catalyst, the surface area of AT- and C18-coated catalysts dropped
from 3.0 m2/g to 1.7 m2/g and 0.4 m2/g, respectively, suggesting
that AT and C18 blocked 43% and 86% of surface sites, respectively.
The sulfur content on the coated catalyst was also characterized
using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES). Consistent with the surface coverage given by CO
chemisorption, the sulfur content of the C18 coating was approxi-
mately twice than that of the AT coating (Table S1). The surface
coverages reported here are larger than those measured by STM
on single crystal surfaces (18% for AT and 33% for C18
[20,21]). The difference can be attributed to more corners and
edges on the nanoparticle that allowed for more thiolate adsorp-
tion [28]. The size of thiol-coated catalyst particles was measured
by TEM as (3.4 ± 0.7) nm, similar to that measured on the native
catalyst and not affected by the thiolate modiﬁer (Figs. S1 and S2).
For the spent catalysts, TEM, ICP-OES, and DRIFTS were used to
characterize the particle size, metal and sulfur content, and the
ordering of the thiolate modiﬁer. The thiolate coating was found
to remain ordered and stable after reaction according to the posi-
tion of the methylene stretching features in DRIFTS (Figs. S3 and
S4). However, ICP-OES suggested that both unmodiﬁed and modi-
ﬁed palladium particles underwent leaching during the reaction
(Fig. S5) without signiﬁcant change of particle size (Figs. S1 and
S2).
2.3. Catalytic reactions, selectivity, and rate calculations
The HOL oxidation reaction was run in a 100 mL liquid-phase
semi-batch reactor at 50 C in 40 psi air for 2 h. The reaction solu-
tion included 42 mL heptane (solvent), 0.5 mL trans-2-hexen-1-ol
(reactant) and 3 mL benzene (internal standard for gas chromatog-
raphy analysis). 200 mg catalyst (Pdtotal:alcohol = 1:45 mol/mol)
was used for each reaction. Oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol was
run in similar conditions (benzene and toluene were used as sol-
vent and internal standard, respectively), while a higher tempera-
ture of 65 C was applied. A total of eight 1 mL liquid samples were
taken from the reactor during the reaction period. The ratio of the
catalyst to the reaction solution was held constant within the reac-
tor by simultaneously sampling liquid and catalyst, and subse-
quently ﬁltering out the catalyst. The liquid samples were
analyzed by an Agilent 5890A gas chromatograph with a ﬂame ion-
ization detector. An Agilent HP-5 capillary was used.
The concentrations of reactants and products in the reaction
solution were converted from peak areas obtained from GC analy-
sis using response factors, which were measured by a series of
standard solutions. The concentrations of the standard solutions
were comparable to reaction conditions. The selectivity and rate
calculations were both based on the concentration. To avoid the
ambiguity of turnover frequency (TOF) measurements, the rates
here were reported as moles of reactant consumed per mole of
total metal catalyst instead of per surface site. Error bars were cal-
culated based on repeating reactions.
2.4. Diffuse Reﬂectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(DRIFTS)
DRIFTS was performed using a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet 6700
FT-IR. The HAL and CO adsorption analyses were performed in a
closed cell attachment, and pre-/post-reaction samples were ana-
lyzed with an opened sample holder. The IR spectra were taken
with 2 cm1 resolution, using 400 scans for background collection
and 100 scans for sample collection.
For the HAL adsorption analysis, background spectra were
obtained for the corresponding catalysts (native Pd, AT- and C18-
coated Pd) prior to hexenal adsorption, and thus the spectra only
represented change due to HAL adsorption. In situ pretreatment
of the catalyst was performed before hexenal exposure, using Ar
as the carrier gas. For uncoated samples, an oxidation (1 h) –
reduction (3 h) procedure at 120 C was performed, while a single
3-h-reduction at 120 C was performed for the thiolate-coated cat-
alysts. Background spectra were obtained in Ar ﬂow after the sam-
ples were cooled to room temperature. Hexenal was dosed on the
catalysts in Ar ﬂow at room temperature, followed by a 20 min
purging in 50 sccm Ar ﬂow. The spectra were taken in Ar ﬂow
immediately after the purging procedure. For the heated samples,
the catalyst was elevated to the desired temperature and held for

2 min, followed by cooling to room temperature. All spectra were
obtained at room temperature.
For the post-reaction samples, the catalyst was removed from
the reaction solution without further treatment. The spectra were
taken after drying the sample in a desiccator for 30 min.
3. Results
3.1. Liquid-phase catalytic studies
The oxidation of HOL (Scheme 1) was performed in a semi-
batch liquid phase reactor at 50 C under a constant air pressure
of 40 psi. The maximum rates obtained over each catalyst are
reported in Table 1. A high selectivity to HAL of approximately
90% (Table 1) was obtained on the uncoated catalyst, consistent
with previous reports for similar reactions [3]. Modiﬁcation of
the catalyst by AT did not appreciably affect selectivity, whereas
the C18 modiﬁer lowered the selectivity to 80%. Previous studies
have found that dense C18 SAMs decrease the rate of double bond
migration reactions less than other reactions [29], consistent with
the dense C18 coating allowing more facile isomerization com-
pared to oxidation.
Fig. 1 summarizes the conversion proﬁle over the uncoated and
modiﬁed Pd/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of a 2-h reaction. The
kinetic features were strongly inﬂuenced by thiolate modiﬁcation
of the surface. On the uncoated surface, a high initial rate was
observed, followed by a rapid deactivation. In fact, almost half of
the HOL consumed during the 2-h reaction reacted within the ﬁrst
5 min. While the AT-coated catalyst exhibited a lower initial rate,
presumably due to site blocking by the thiolate ligand, deactivation
was not as pronounced, resulting in a higher total conversion after
2 h. Similarly, the C18-coated catalyst also effectively suppressed
the deactivation and increased the reaction rate over the native
catalyst. Interestingly, the conversion on the C18-coated catalyst
was 10% higher than that for the AT coating after 2 h. This con-
trasted with results for hydrogenation reactions, where C18-
coated catalysts showed much lower activity due to increased
blocking of the surface [16–18]. The higher conversion despite
increased blocking indicated that the densely packed C18 SAM
suppressed catalyst deactivation more effectively.
Previous studies suggested that the deactivation of the Pd cata-
lyst may be due to strongly adsorbed species generated by unsat-
urated
aldehydes.

CO
adsorption on the catalysts (Fig. S7) suggested a signiﬁcant loss
of surface sites on the native catalyst after reaction, possibly due
to surface poisoning by carbonaceous species. On the contrary,
most of the available sites on C18-coated catalyst previous to reac-
tion still remained unoccupied after reaction. We therefore
hypothesized that the generation of HAL-derived adsorbates was
responsible for the deactivation of the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, which
could be hindered by thiol modiﬁcation, more effectively by denser
SAMs.
To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we ran reactions in which the HAL
product was fed to the starting reaction solution. The amount of
HAL added to the reaction solution corresponded to the amount

a The maximum rates on each catalyst were obtained during the reaction course of ﬁrst 2.5 min. TOF was calculated as moles of reactant consumed per mole of surface Pd.
A dispersion of 20% was used for both native and coated catalysts; the theoretical thiolate coverages of 18% and 33% were used for AT-coated and C18-coated Pd/Al2O3,
respectively. The experimental TOF for the coated catalysts are probably larger than the calculated value, because the thiolate surface coverage was likely underestimated.
b The reported selectivity was calculated at 50% conversion. During the whole reaction course, the selectivity to HAL slightly increased with conversion on all surfaces
with a decrease in hexanal selectivity. Selectivity to individual products as a function of conversion can be referred to Fig. S6. Reaction condition: 50 C, 40 psi air; starting

present at 30% conversion of HOL. The activity of the catalysts was
determined by the initial rate during the ﬁrst 2.5 minutes of the
reaction, as summarized in Fig. 2. In the absence of HAL, the rate
was highest on the uncoated catalyst and decreased with increas-
ing coverage of the thiolate modiﬁer as a result of site blocking.
With HAL in the feed, signiﬁcantly lower activities were observed
for all catalysts, but the rate on the uncoated catalyst decreased
most dramatically. In fact, in the presence of HAL, the initial rate
was improved by 60% by the AT coating and 100% by the C18 coat-
ing, compared to the uncoated catalyst, even with blocking of
active sites by the thiolate ligand. This conﬁrmed that the thiol
modiﬁcation dramatically suppressed surface poisoning induced
by HAL-derivatives.
3.2. DRIFTS of the HAL molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surfaces
DRIFTS measurements were performed to better understand
the interactions of HAL with the Pd catalysts (Fig. 3). Gas-phase
HAL was exposed to the uncoated and thiolate-coated surfaces at
room temperature, followed by incremental elevation of the tem-
perature to 473 K. The IR spectrum of liquid-phase HAL was also
shown in the ﬁgure for comparison.
Upon adsorption, the m(C@O) and m(C@C) stretching modes of
HAL
were
red-shifted
on
all
surfaces
from
1692 cm1
to
1670 cm1, and from 1640 cm1 to 1624 cm1, respectively. This
was consistent with previous reports of adsorbed allylic aldehydes
acrolein and crotonaldehyde on Pt [30–32], where C@O and C@C
bonds interacted with the metal surface. With increased tempera-
ture, a signiﬁcant attenuation of the m(C@O) peak occurred on all
three surfaces, indicating the consumption of the C@O group
through reaction (i.e., decarbonylation) or desorption of HAL. Dif-
ferent spectral features were observed on the three surfaces in
the regions of 1500–1600 cm1 and 1750–2000 cm1, suggesting
that the chemistry of HAL on the Pd surface was altered by the thi-
olate modiﬁer.
Strong peaks at 1593 and 1566 cm1 (COO asymmetric stretch-
ing region [33]) were observed upon HAL adsorption on the
uncoated surface and gradually increased in magnitude with
increasing temperature. Because similar peaks were previously
assigned to benzoate species produced from benzyl alcohol
adsorbed on Pd/Al2O3 under Ar [8], we attribute these features to
HAL-derived carboxylate species. The carboxylates were presum-
ably formed from HAL dimerization/oligomerization rather than
oxidation, as abundant surface oxygen was unlikely to be available
for aldehyde oxidation under the anaerobic conditions employed
here. Similar oligomerization reactions have been suggested for
aldehydes on metal surfaces [34,35], and have been proposed to
cause surface poisoning during alcohol oxidations on Pd [36,37].
In the presence of either AT or C18 SAMs, however, the peaks at
1593 and 1566 cm1 were not observed, suggesting that the sur-
face coatings suppressed the adsorption of adjacent HAL molecules
and/or large dimer species during dimerization. We attribute the
decrease in the extent of deactivation on the SAM-coated catalysts
to this suppression of adsorbed dimers.
Based on the DRIFTS results, the most abundant surface species
formed on the AT- and C18-coated surfaces were also distinct,
however. The AT-coated surface exhibited the appearance of sur-
face CO at 1835 cm1 at room temperature. In contrast, surface
CO was barely detected at room temperature on either the
uncoated or the C18-coated surfaces. Because decarbonylation of
unsaturated aldehydes is known to occur below room temperature
on Pd surfaces [9,10,38], we attributed the absence of CO to the
high coverage of hexenal-derived surface intermediates or C18-
thiols rather than a barrier intrinsic to the Pd surface. Suppression
of decarbonylation on Pd has also been reported by Ferri et al.,
using Bi as modiﬁer to block Pd surface sites [39]. Similarly,
according to Pang et al., the C18 coating can more severely limit
the threefold sites on palladium than the AT-coating [22]. The
decrease in threefold sites may prevent the ﬂat-lying adsorption
of the aldehyde through C@C and C@O bonds, which was reported
as the primary adsorption geometry on Pd(111) surface [40].
Decarbonylation was thus unfavorable, as it was hypothesized to
require the interaction between C@O bond and metal surface
[30]. Thus, in addition to blocking formation of dimers, the denser
C18 monolayers also appeared to suppress decarbonylation. We
speculated that the enhanced effectiveness of the C18 coating com-
pared to AT was related to the inhibition of both of these side
reactions.
While decarbonylation was hindered at low temperature on
both uncoated and C18-coated surfaces, it could be activated at
higher temperatures, as indicated by the detection of CO in
temperature-programmed desorption experiments (Fig. S9). How-
ever, little or no CO signal was observed on the surface (Fig. 3),
indicating that CO desorbed as soon as it was produced.
3.3. Reusability of the SAM-coated palladium catalysts
To test the stability of the thiolate modiﬁer on the palladium
catalysts, recycling studies were performed under the same reac-

tion conditions. The catalyst was recovered following each reaction
and re-used without further treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, the
activity of the uncoated catalyst dropped markedly after the ﬁrst
run, and modest additional deactivation occurred with further
reactions. For the AT- and C18-coated catalyst, however, the activ-
ity remained virtually unchanged after three runs. Metal leaching
occurred on all native and modiﬁed catalysts during the reaction,
as suggested by ICP-OES analysis (Fig. S5), which could not be
inferred from Fig. 4 because the rate was calculated on a mole of
Pd basis. In contrast to the instability of Pd, elemental and spectro-
scopic analysis suggested that the thiolate modiﬁer remained
stable, showing no signiﬁcant desorption nor disordering after
exposure to reaction conditions (Figs. S3 and S4). X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the thiolate coating
was not oxidized to form sulfates during the reaction (Fig. S11). On
the contrary, they were reduced, possibly by the hydrogen gener-
ated from HOL or HAL adsorption. The recycling studies suggested
again that the AT and C18 modiﬁers were able to hinder poisoning
and remain stable on the Pd surface for at least three successive
reaction runs. On the other hand, the uncoated catalyst was
strongly poisoned by exposure to reaction conditions. Thus, while
both the uncoated and coated catalysts exhibited a layer of
strongly adsorbed spectator species shortly after reaction initia-
tion, in the case of the thiol coating the organized SAM layer fos-
tered
greater
reactivity
than
the
layer
of
hexenal-derived
intermediates produced from reaction on the uncoated catalyst.
4. Discussion
As discussed above, the poisoning species formed from HAL can
be attributed to formation of dimers or oligomers and to decar-
bonylation to CO and carbonaceous residue. While CO can be read-
ily removed by reaction with surface oxygen to produce CO2 under
oxidation conditions, the easy removal of hydrocarbon fragments
is not expected [4,13]. The absence of surface CO was conﬁrmed
in a polarization-modulation infrared reﬂection-absorption spec-
troscopy (PM-IRRAS) study of the liquid phase oxidation of benzyl
alcohol at 50 C [12]. Whereas accumulation of CO on the Pd sur-
face was detected in the absence of O2, no surface CO was observed
under aerobic conditions. Thus under the reaction conditions
employed here, hydrocarbon residue instead of CO on the surface
is proposed to be the major cause of catalyst deactivation. Similar
observations reported by Pastor et al. suggested that short car-
bonaceous fragments such as CH3CH2COad, CH3CH2ad, and CH3CH2-
CH2ad,
were
the
strongly
adsorbed
species
on
Pt
during
electrooxidation of 1-propanol [41]. Moreover, Burgener et al. pro-
posed that citral underwent dimerization and oligomerization on
the Pd surface, resulting in irreversible catalyst deactivation that
could not be caused by decarbonylation alone [42]. These studies
support our hypothesis for the promoting effect of AT and C18;
while the uncoated surface suffered from poisoning by the HAL-
dimer, the AT-coated surface was mainly poisoned by the short
carbonaceous fragments. The C18-coated surface, on the other
hand, resists the adsorption of both species more effectively and
exhibited a better performance.
As mentioned above, bismuth has previously been used to sup-
press deactivation of Pt-group catalysts during alcohol oxidation.
In addition to Bi, other inorganic promoters, such as lead, tin,
and gold, have also been applied as catalyst promoters [5,43–45].
These promoters have sometimes been reported to decrease the
extent of catalyst deactivation by promoting desorption of aldehy-
des or suppressing the decarbonylation pathway. Besides the pur-
ported site blocking effect, as discussed for Bi, another frequently
reported mechanism involves the dilution effect of catalytic sites,
also known as the ‘‘ensemble effect” [46]. In this model, a promoter
geometrically isolates individual active sites to prevent the forma-
tion and adsorption of the surface-poisoning species that require
large regions of continuous surface sites [13,47,48]. In addition,
promoters such as Bi and Sn have also been suggested to enhance
desorption of aldehydes by altering the electronic structure of the
catalysts [49–51], or by forming promoter-adsorbate complexes
[52,53]. The ambiguity of the promoter effect is partially due to
the complex nature of the bimetallic surface and the difﬁculty in
controllably manipulating the surface structure. In this study, the
thiolate modiﬁers are proposed to limit deactivation in a similar
manner to metallic promoters such as Bi, i.e., by blocking active
sites to prevent side reactions that form strongly bound species.
The adsorption sites and the coverage of the modiﬁer inﬂuence
the activity of dimerization and decarbonylation in the oxidation
of HOL. We did not detect a change in the electronic state of Pd
due to thiolate modiﬁcation in XPS (Fig. S13), but a subtle inﬂuence
of thiolates on the electronic structure of the active site cannot be
ruled out, and in fact has been proposed to be important in other
reactions [16]. While the deposition of bimetallic modiﬁers often
requires careful control and characterization, thiolate modiﬁcation
is self-limiting and can be conveniently controlled by varying the
steric bulk of the tail group.
The tuning of the thiolate coverage to achieve selectivity control
has been used previously for hydrogenation reactions [22,27]. Pang
et al. demonstrated that active sites can be selectively blocked by
varying the tail of thiolate modiﬁers to facilitate either decarbony-
lation or hydrogenation of furfural on supported Pd catalysts. Here,
we similarly observed that under signiﬁcantly different reaction
conditions (oxygen-containing environment, liquid-phase reaction
mixture) thiolates also have a signiﬁcant effect on selectivity. How-
ever, for the current study, the thiolate monolayers appeared to
selectively suppress dimerization side reactions leading to surface
poisons.
Previous studies have proposed that oxidation of palladium cat-
alysts can result in less-active oxidized Pd species [39]. More
recent studies, however, have indicated that oxidized Pd sites are
actually the active site for the reaction [3,14]. In any case, investi-
gations of the performance of thiolate coatings as a function of
oxygen pressure are of interest, in part because degradation of
the catalyst coatings, presumably via oxidation of the surface sul-
fur, has also been observed after exposing thiolate-coated catalysts
to air [20,54]. In preliminary investigations, we observed a lower
reaction rate for the uncoated catalyst at an air pressure of 60 psi

than 40 psi; in contrast, the rate on the AT-coated catalyst
increased over the same pressure range (Fig. S12). While such
behavior might suggest that the thiolate coating improves resis-
tance to ‘‘over-oxidation”, the prior work discussed above casts
doubt on such a conclusion. However, it seems clear that thiolate
coatings changed the surface interaction with both 2-hexenal
and oxygen, in the latter case promoting activity at higher pres-
sure. XPS studies conducted on pre- and post-reaction catalysts
conﬁrmed no signiﬁcant oxidation of either the Pd or the thiolate
coating during the reaction (Figs. S11 and S13). The absence of
the increase in the features associated with sulfur oxidation in
the XPS spectra was consistent with the reusability studies, which
indicated stable performance of the catalysts upon recycling. The
resistance to oxidation was probably due to the relatively low oxy-
gen pressure that allowed oxygen to remove only the surface spe-
cies (e.g., CO and hydrogen) without oxidation of Pd or sulfur. This
suggests that the thiolate modiﬁer is stable and potentially appli-
cable in mild oxidative conditions. However, its stability and the
ability to prevent Pd over-oxidation under high oxygen pressure
need to be further studied.
Thiolate modiﬁcation may be extendable to other unsaturated
alcohols. As a preliminary test, we evaluated the uncoated and
C18-coated Pd catalysts for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to
cinnamaldehyde. The C18 coating again lowered the initial rate
of reaction in aldehyde-free conditions (Table 2), but exhibited a
higher initial rate in the presence of cinnamaldehyde. The magni-
tude of the C18 effects was much lower than during HOL reaction,
indicating that the observed inﬂuence of the SAM coating may be
sensitive to the alcohol oxidation chemistry, hypothetically due
to various kinetics of aldehyde decomposition/dimerization reac-
tions that occur from different precursors.
5. Conclusions
Here, we demonstrate that thiolate SAMs can be applied as pro-
moters on the supported palladium catalysts in the liquid-phase
HOL oxidation. The reaction product HAL formed surface residues
on native Pd/Al2O3 that poison the catalyst. By thiolate modiﬁca-
tion, HAL poisoning was limited, hypothetically due to isolation
of active sites. On the AT-coated surface, decarbonylation was
the major side reaction of HAL, forming smaller carbonaceous frag-
ments that blocked fewer active sites and were more easily
removed from the surface. The C18-coated surface hindered decar-
bonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison
attributed to a surfaces dimer, and exhibited the highest activity.
Therefore, the thiolate modiﬁer was able to improve the catalytic
activity and help prevent deactivation by suppressing the side
reactions of HAL and thus the formation of poisoning species. Com-
pared to conventional metallic promoters, the thiolate modiﬁers
provide a more straightforward platform for a controlled design
of the near-surface environment. This ability makes it an attractive
potential modiﬁer of the Pt-group catalysts for low-temperature
aerobic oxidation of alcohols.
