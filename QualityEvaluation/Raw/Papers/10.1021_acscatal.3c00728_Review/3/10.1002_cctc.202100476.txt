Graphical Abstract
Nanofiber Catalysis: Hexagonal boron nitride has been regarded as a potential inorganic nonmetallic catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Herein, a novel nanofiber catalyst consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) was prepared via electrospinning method, which exhibited remarkable 24.9 golefins ⋅ gBN−1 ⋅ h−1 productivity of olefins in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
Abstract
Fibrous nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to the promoted utilization of the surface and facilitated mass transfer process. In this study, we prepared one-dimensional nanofiber catalysts consisting of hexagonal boron nitride/silica oxide (h-BN/SiO2) via electrospinning method. The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150–300 nm through h-BN loading change. When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4 % conversion of propane and 85.1 % selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9 golefins ⋅ gBN−1 ⋅ h−1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date. This study shines light on the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as well as a new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.
1 Introduction
The production process of propylene, which is one of the fundamental industrial products, has attracted much attention.1 Compared with the commercially used direct dehydrogenation route, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising alternative with non-equilibrium limitation and resistance to coke deposition. Metal oxide-based catalysts have been widely studied for ODHP reaction in the past decades, which still faced with a great challenge of low propylene selectivity due to the over oxidation reaction.2-4
In recent years, the superior activity of h-BN in ODHP was demonstrated,2, 3, 5 which inspired a wave for the research of boron-based ODHP catalysts. Meanwhile, the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP have been extensively studied. In the previous work,6, 7 based on various means of spectroscopy studies, we proposed the B−OH at the edges and defects of h-BN as the active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by means of experimental and theoretical methods, which was subsequently confirmed by other groups.5, 6 Although the conventional bulk h-BN can activate the alkane, the utilization efficiency of h-BN is low due to the small number of exposed defects and B−OH groups.10 Therefore, designing an applicable catalyst with abundant active sites is of crucial significance.
One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure.8, 9 Electrospinning is an effective and widely studied method to prepare one-dimensional nanomaterials and has been applied in many fields including biomedicine, energy storage, and catalysis.10-14 The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process.13 Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.15, 16 Various materials were used as supports for one-dimensional catalysts prepared by electrospinning method, such as titanium dioxide, alumina, silica, etc. Among them, silica (SiO2) is regarded as a promising one due to its excellent thermal and chemical stability.17, 18 Moreover, the abundant −OH groups of SiO2 support can promote the anchoring and dispersity of h-BN.19-24
Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene. The morphology of the catalyst as well as the effect of the h-BN loading was investigated.
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Design and structure characterization of h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers
Spinning solution is the key for fabricating nanofiber by electrospinning, which needs to have a certain viscosity and uniform dispersion.11 Herein, a mixture of PVA and TEOS aqueous solution containing exfoliated h-BN was used as the spinning solution (Figure 1a). Particularly, the exfoliated h-BN via ball milling contained more defects and edge sites with abundant B−OH groups,28 which facilitated the dispersion of h-BN in the aqueous solution.29 By diluting the spinning solution with deionized water, the Tyndall phenomenon was clearly observed under laser irradiation, further confirming that the exfoliated h-BN was homodispersed in the spinning solution.30

The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil. The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure (Figure 1b). Besides, some knots were observed in the nanofiber structure, indicating that a few large sizes of particles were involved in the prepared nanofiber, consistent with SEM images of exfoliated h-BN. According to ICP-OES elemental analysis results for the dried spinning solution (the boron content was 0.45 wt %) and nanofiber (the boron content was 0.46 wt %) where the theoretical loading of h-BN in h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was 7 wt %, a few large sizes of h-BN particles had no effect on the h-BN loading of nanofiber.
The nanofibers with varying h-BN loadings were prepared via the addition of different weight exfoliated h-BN. After calcination at 600 °C, similar fibrous morphology was observed from SEM images (Figure 2a–e). The average diameters were 155 nm, 199 nm, 220 nm, 237 nm, and 274 nm for nanofiber catalysts with h-BN weight amounts of 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt %, respectively. Hence, the average diameter of the nanofibers increased with the h-BN amount increasing, which was attributed to the increase of the solution viscosity due to the inclusion of h-BN in the spinning solution.11 Typically, it was noteworthy that the average fiber diameter of the prepared nanofiber with 5 wt % loading was 252 nm (Figure 1b), and decreased to 237 nm after calcination (Figure 2d), which was caused by the decomposition of PVA in the sample.31

The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure 2f–h) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support. Meanwhile, the EDX data of the nanofiber catalyst recorded along with elemental analysis revealed the molar ratio of O to Si was a little higher than 2, which was in agreement with the stoichiometric ratio in SiO2 while the additional oxygen came from h-BN. Moreover, the ratio of B and N was higher than 1, because the ball milling and calcination processes made h-BN produce more B−OH groups at the edges and defects.28
The chemical structure of the prepared nanofiber catalysts before and after calcination was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 3a). The band observed at 3412 cm−1 for the uncalcined nanofiber catalyst was attributed to the stretching vibrations of Si−OH32 or B−OH33 bond, and band at 1210 cm−1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of B−O bond.10 Due to the interference of the stretching vibrations of Si−OH group, it was difficult to confirm the B−OH in the nanofiber catalyst. However, the presence of B−OH33 (3394 cm−1) was observed for the exfoliated h-BN by ball-milling (Figure 3b). According to the above experimental results, we speculated that the existence of B−OH species over the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst. Observed absorption band at 950 cm−1 for the uncalcined catalyst was attributed to the bending vibration of Si−OH34 bond. After calcination, the band weakened considerably. The band centered at 1710 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration peak of C=O, which disappeared after calcination, indicating that organics were effectively removed after calcination.35 The bands positioned around 1120 and 1078 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of Si−O,34 Meanwhile, The bands at 1398 and 811 cm−1 were ascribed to the in-plane B−N stretching vibrations and out-of-plane B−N−B bending vibrations of h-BN respectively,36 suggesting the existence of h-BN in the prepared nanofiber catalysts.

The XRD patterns of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loadings were shown in Figure 3c. The broad diﬀraction peak around 22.6° suggested the SiO2 in the nanofibers exhibited amorphous phase.25 Meanwhile, the characteristic diﬀraction peak at 2θ of 26.8° for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was corresponding to the (002) crystal planes of h-BN.37 The presence of h-BN has no eﬀect on the amorphous structure of the SiO2.
2.2 Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with different h-BN loadings in the ODHP reaction was investigated. The propane conversion increased with the reaction temperature increasing, typically, as the temperature increased from 480 to 510 °C, the propane conversion of h-BN (7 wt %)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst increased from 3.6 % to 22.2 % (Figure 4a). As comparison, a blank experiment was conducted with the pure SiO2 nanofiber catalyst under the same reaction conditions, which showed a poor activity performance, with only 2.5 % C3H8 conversion at 510 °C. Moreover, the selectivity towards light olefins (propylene+ethene) over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts all remained above 90 %. However, it was noteworthy that the selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product reached 10.2 % at 500 °C for the pure SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, but ∼1.1 % at 500 °C for h-BN (7 wt %)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure 4b). Thus, it clearly indicated that the activity of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts originates from the h-BN. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion.38

Catalytic activity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loadings: (a) Influence of temperature on the propane conversion, (b) propane conversion and products distribution. Reaction conditions: 500 °C; gas feed, 16.7 vol % C3H8, 25.0 vol % O2, 58.3 vol % N2; total flow rate=12 mL/min.
To illustrate the role of the one-dimensional structure of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst on the activity, a controlled experiment was performed by using exfoliated h-BN powder as catalyst. The exfoliated h-BN powder was diluted with quartz sand to ensure the total bed height and the weight of h-BN was the same as h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst. Under the same reaction conditions, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction (Figure 5a). For example, under the same reaction temperature of 500 °C, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst reached the conversion of 12.2 %, while the bulk h-BN catalyst only showed a conversion of 7.1 %. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. These results were consistent with the previous research phenomenon of the oxidation and dehydrogenation of alkanes by the bulk h-BN catalysts reported by our group,4, 35 indicating that the catalytic properties of h-BN remained after loaded on SiO2. The catalyst stability was evaluated through a time-on-stream experiment performed at 500 °C and the result was shown in Figure 5b. The conversion of propane stabilized at ∼13 %, with the selectivity of propylene and ethylene stabilized at 84 % and 7 % during the 500 min test. Moreover, the weight of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst remained unchanged after 500 min reaction. Combining with the stability test results, it was concluded that the stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect.40

One of the most important requirements for commercially attractive ODHP catalysts is their ability to achieve a high productivity of olefins.41 The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9 golefins ⋅ gBN−1 ⋅ h−1 under 500 °C at a space velocity of 48000 ml ⋅ gcat−1 ⋅ h−1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table 1) used in the ODHP reaction. It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed.13

3 Conclusion
In summary, a novel one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst has been prepared by a feasible and easy-to-use electrospinning method. The nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loading showed excellent catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to the one-dimensional structure and evenly dispersion of h-BN in the support, as evidenced by high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity. Meanwhile, the olefins productivity over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was much higher than reported boron nitride-based catalysts. This study provides a new strategy for effectively dispersing h-BN to enhance the space utilization of h-BN and olefins productivity and prepare more efficient boron-based catalysts in the future.
Experimental Section
Materials
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Polypropylene alcohol-1788 (PVA), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and oxalic acid dihydrate were supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. The above materials and chemical reagents were directly used in the experiment without further processing and purification.
Preparation of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst
The bulk h-BN was exfoliated by the high-speed ball milling method.36 In brief, 4 g of h-BN was added inside a zirconia milling container with the planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 7 plus, Fritsch) at a rotation speed of 800 rpm for 15 min. After washing treatment, the obtained powders were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and dried at 50 °C. The spinning solution was prepared as follows: first, TEOS and oxalic acid dihydrate was added into deionized water and stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. Then the various amount of exfoliated h-BN (0, 1, 3, 5, 7 wt % of the mass of SiO2) was added into the hydrolyzed TEOS and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. Secondly, the dissolution of PVA: a certain amount of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added into deionized water and stirred at 60 °C for 4 hours, and then cooling down to room temperature. Finally, the TEOS solution containing h-BN was added to the PVA solution and stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, and kept at room temperature for 15 hours. The homogeneous solution was typically extruded through a stainless-steel nozzle with a diameter of 0.41 mm at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml h−1. The aluminum foil plate was used for receiving. The distance between the plate and the needle was 16 cm. A DC voltage of 17 kV was applied. The ambient temperature was about 30 °C, and the humidity was below 10 %. The collected electrospun nanofibers were calcinated from room temperature to 600 °C with the rate of 4 °C min−1 and stayed at 600 °C for 2 h.
Catalyst characterization
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was taken using the Hitachi SU8220 instrument. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image was obtained on an FEI Tecnai F30 high-resolution microscope, under 300 kV acceleration voltage, the sample was ground into a powder and dispersed in ethanol, and then on the porous carbon film on the copper grid. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried on a PANalytical X′Pert3 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406 nm). The tube voltage and the current were 40 kV and 40 mA. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained by Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer using mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The actual boron content of the dried spinning solution and nanofiber collected from the tin plate were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Optima2000DV.
Catalytic test
The propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was conducted on a fixed bed reactor equipped with a quartz tube.15 mg of catalyst was put into a quartz reaction tube. The upper and lower ends were fixed with quartz wool. Before the reaction, the catalyst was pre-activated for 3 hours under the reaction gas atmosphere (C3H8: 2 mL/min, O2: 3 mL/min, N2: 7 mL/min) at 535 °C. The reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). A GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5 A column, connected to a TCD were used to analyze the O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2. The conversion rate and products selectivity are calculated using the methods proposed in our previous work.22, 35 Typically, conversion and selectivity were defined as follow [Eq. (1) and Eq. 2]:

The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 100 %±5 %.

The propane conversion increased with the reaction temperature increasing, typically, as the temperature increased from 480 to 510 °C, the propane conversion of h-BN (7 wt %)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst increased from 3.6 % to 22.2 % (Figure 4a). As comparison, a blank experiment was conducted with the pure SiO2 nanofiber catalyst under the same reaction conditions, which showed a poor activity performance, with only 2.5 % C3H8 conversion at 510 °C. Moreover, the selectivity towards light olefins (propylene+ethene) over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts all remained above 90 %. However, it was noteworthy that the selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product reached 10.2 % at 500 °C for the pure SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, but ∼1.1 % at 500 °C for h-BN (7 wt %)/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure 4b). Thus, it clearly indicated that the activity of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts originates from the h-BN. The h-BN loading had a noticeable effect on the C3H8 conversion, with the h-BN loading increasing, the conversion of propane increased linearly, which proved that the conversion was not limited by the molecular diffusion.38

Catalytic activity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loadings: (a) Influence of temperature on the propane conversion, (b) propane conversion and products distribution. Reaction conditions: 500 °C; gas feed, 16.7 vol % C3H8, 25.0 vol % O2, 58.3 vol % N2; total flow rate=12 mL/min.
To illustrate the role of the one-dimensional structure of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst on the activity, a controlled experiment was performed by using exfoliated h-BN powder as catalyst. The exfoliated h-BN powder was diluted with quartz sand to ensure the total bed height and the weight of h-BN was the same as h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst. Under the same reaction conditions, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction (Figure 5a). For example, under the same reaction temperature of 500 °C, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst reached the conversion of 12.2 %, while the bulk h-BN catalyst only showed a conversion of 7.1 %. The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion. These results were consistent with the previous research phenomenon of the oxidation and dehydrogenation of alkanes by the bulk h-BN catalysts reported by our group,4, 35 indicating that the catalytic properties of h-BN remained after loaded on SiO2. The catalyst stability was evaluated through a time-on-stream experiment performed at 500 °C and the result was shown in Figure 5b. The conversion of propane stabilized at ∼13 %, with the selectivity of propylene and ethylene stabilized at 84 % and 7 % during the 500 min test. Moreover, the weight of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst remained unchanged after 500 min reaction. Combining with the stability test results, it was concluded that the stability of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was superior, which was probably attributed to the SiO2 support anchoring effect.40

One of the most important requirements for commercially attractive ODHP catalysts is their ability to achieve a high productivity of olefins.41 The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9 golefins ⋅ gBN−1 ⋅ h−1 under 500 °C at a space velocity of 48000 ml ⋅ gcat−1 ⋅ h−1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table 1) used in the ODHP reaction. It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed.13

3 Conclusion
In summary, a novel one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst has been prepared by a feasible and easy-to-use electrospinning method. The nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loading showed excellent catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to the one-dimensional structure and evenly dispersion of h-BN in the support, as evidenced by high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity. Meanwhile, the olefins productivity over h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was much higher than reported boron nitride-based catalysts. This study provides a new strategy for effectively dispersing h-BN to enhance the space utilization of h-BN and olefins productivity and prepare more efficient boron-based catalysts in the future.
Experimental Section
Materials
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Polypropylene alcohol-1788 (PVA), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and oxalic acid dihydrate were supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. The above materials and chemical reagents were directly used in the experiment without further processing and purification.
Preparation of h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst
The bulk h-BN was exfoliated by the high-speed ball milling method.36 In brief, 4 g of h-BN was added inside a zirconia milling container with the planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 7 plus, Fritsch) at a rotation speed of 800 rpm for 15 min. After washing treatment, the obtained powders were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and dried at 50 °C. The spinning solution was prepared as follows: first, TEOS and oxalic acid dihydrate was added into deionized water and stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. Then the various amount of exfoliated h-BN (0, 1, 3, 5, 7 wt % of the mass of SiO2) was added into the hydrolyzed TEOS and stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. Secondly, the dissolution of PVA: a certain amount of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added into deionized water and stirred at 60 °C for 4 hours, and then cooling down to room temperature. Finally, the TEOS solution containing h-BN was added to the PVA solution and stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, and kept at room temperature for 15 hours. The homogeneous solution was typically extruded through a stainless-steel nozzle with a diameter of 0.41 mm at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml h−1. The aluminum foil plate was used for receiving. The distance between the plate and the needle was 16 cm. A DC voltage of 17 kV was applied. The ambient temperature was about 30 °C, and the humidity was below 10 %. The collected electrospun nanofibers were calcinated from room temperature to 600 °C with the rate of 4 °C min−1 and stayed at 600 °C for 2 h.
Catalyst characterization
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was taken using the Hitachi SU8220 instrument. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image was obtained on an FEI Tecnai F30 high-resolution microscope, under 300 kV acceleration voltage, the sample was ground into a powder and dispersed in ethanol, and then on the porous carbon film on the copper grid. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried on a PANalytical X′Pert3 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406 nm). The tube voltage and the current were 40 kV and 40 mA. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained by Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer using mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The actual boron content of the dried spinning solution and nanofiber collected from the tin plate were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Optima2000DV.
Catalytic test
The propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction was conducted on a fixed bed reactor equipped with a quartz tube.15 mg of catalyst was put into a quartz reaction tube. The upper and lower ends were fixed with quartz wool. Before the reaction, the catalyst was pre-activated for 3 hours under the reaction gas atmosphere (C3H8: 2 mL/min, O2: 3 mL/min, N2: 7 mL/min) at 535 °C. The reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). A GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5 A column, connected to a TCD were used to analyze the O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2. The conversion rate and products selectivity are calculated using the methods proposed in our previous work.22, 35 Typically, conversion and selectivity were defined as follow [Eq. (1) and Eq. 2]:

The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 100 %±5 %.
