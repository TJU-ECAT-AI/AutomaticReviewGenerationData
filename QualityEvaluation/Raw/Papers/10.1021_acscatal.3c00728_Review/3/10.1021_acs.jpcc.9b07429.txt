Abstract
We report on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity of silica-supported boron oxide prepared via incipient wetness impregnation. Characterization of pristine and spent catalysts with infrared, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy reveals the presence of both isolated and aggregated oxidized boron sites. The results of these investigations, in combination with our earlier work on bulk boron-containing ODH catalysts (e.g., h-BN, metal borides, and elemental boron), give direct evidence that oxidized boron species formed in situ on the surface of these materials are responsible for the exceptional catalytic behavior. We anticipate that investigation of supported boron materials can provide insight into the structural characteristics required for selective boron-containing ODH catalysts.

1. Introduction
In recent years, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and other boron-containing (bulk) materials have been reported as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to olefins. (1−8) For all of these active materials, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy revealed the formation of oxidized boron species on the surface of the materials following catalytic testing for the ODH of propane. (7,8) We recently investigated spent h-BN ODH catalysts using (multidimensional) solid-state NMR spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (9) This work revealed the formation of an amorphous oxidized/hydrolyzed boron layer consisting of 3-fold coordinate boron sites with a general formula B2(OH)2xO3–x (x = 0–3) to account for varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups coordinated to each boron atom within this phase. Although we observe an induction period during which the oxide layer forms, these observations do not allow us to irrefutably conclude that the B2(OH)2xO3–x layer contains the active sites or whether the formation of this B2(OH)2xO3–x layer is a consequence of the reaction. The synthesis of a catalyst with a more structurally controlled oxidized boron phase could serve to enhance our understanding of boron-containing materials during ODH and could therefore potentially lead to the synthesis of improved catalysts.
To understand the role of the oxide phase, here we have synthesized a series of silica-supported boron oxide materials via incipient wetness impregnation of a triisopropyl borate (B(OiPr)3) solution in isopropanol and subsequent calcination in air. These materials are shown to selectively convert propane to propylene under ODH conditions. The fact that these B/SiO2 materials are active for the ODH of propane gives direct evidence that the oxidized boron layer is indeed active for ODH, which we hypothesized based on our aforementioned characterization studies on h-BN and other boron-containing ODH catalysts. In addition, this is in line with observations from previous work that reports supported boron oxide materials (e.g., boron oxide supported on alumina) as catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes. (10−14) Although those materials were reported to leach boron under the reaction conditions—likely because of the high nominal loading of up to 30 wt % B2O3/Al2O3—we reimagine such supported boron oxide materials as a potential route to the next generation of B-containing ODH catalysts with tunable surface speciation.
We characterize the B/SiO2 materials with a combination of infrared (IR), Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy to develop a detailed understanding of the boron surface sites present on these catalysts. On the basis of our experience with supported metal oxides, (15−17) we synthesized materials with a series of boron loadings that would potentially generate species ranging from well-dispersed, isolated boron sites at low loadings to boron oxide-type agglomerates at higher loadings. In this way, trends in the materials’ catalytic behavior could be correlated to the types of surface species (from isolated to aggregated sites) present on the materials, similar to the case for silica-supported vanadium oxide. (17) In reality, the dispersion of boron on the support, and hence the resultant surface sites on these materials, is far more complex than originally anticipated. We also characterized the spent B/SiO2 catalysts following catalytic testing for ODH of propane with the same characterization methods and found that restructuring of the boron sites on the silica surface takes place. As is also the case for the h-BN catalysts, the surface boron phase on these B/SiO2 catalysts during ODH appears to restructure. These experimental observations are in line with a recent computational study that predicted the formation of a highly dynamic oxide phase on the surface of h-BN under reaction conditions. (18) While these studies have enhanced our understanding of these materials’ catalytic behavior, the complexity of the oxide phase formed on this material presents a significant challenge for determining the exact catalyst features required for high ODH selectivity.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Materials Synthesis
The materials X B/SiO2 (where X corresponds to the B loading) were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation. Prior to impregnation, silica (Aerosil 300 from Evonik, specific surface area of 300 m2 g–1) was dried under static conditions overnight at 120 °C. Impregnation was performed inside a glovebox under a dry N2 atmosphere. A solution of triisopropyl borate (B(OiPr)3; Sigma-Aldrich) in dry isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich; 99.5%) was prepared with such a ratio of B(OiPr)3 to isopropanol so as to achieve a boron loadings from ca. 0.25 to 2 wt %, while using a total solution volume equal to the pore volume of the support (1.4 mL of solution per 1 g of Aerosil 300). This solution was then added dropwise to the silica support. The impregnated sample was transferred to a calcination oven where it calcined to 550 °C at 1 °C min–1 under dry air and held at 550 °C for 3 h.
2.2. Catalytic Testing
The B/SiO2 catalysts were compressed by using a pellet press (Pike Technologies; pressure program: 1 ton of force for 10 s and 2 tons of force for 10 s) and sieved to collect particles of 300–600 μm diameter to limit any potential mass transfer effects. (19) About 25–50 mg of B/SiO2 was diluted in quartz chips in a 1:2 ratio and loaded into a quartz reactor tube (8 mm i.d.) and supported on a bed of quartz wool in the middle of the tube. Additional quartz wool was used to pack the inside of the quartz tube lightly past the catalyst bed to reduce dead volume and minimize the potential for homogeneous gas-phase reactions. Flow rates of C3H8 (instrument grade, Matheson), O2 (UHP, Airgas), and N2 (UHP, Airgas) were controlled by using three mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) and calibrated to each individual gas to allow total flow rates of 40–200 mL min–1. The H2O produced from the reaction was condensed using a thermoelectrically cooled condenser held at −5 °C. The dried reactor effluent was monitored by using an online μGC (Inficon micro GC fusion gas analyzer) equipped with three GC modules and three microthermal conductivity detectors (μTCD). O2, N2, CH4, and CO were analyzed by using a Rt-molsieve 5A column, CO2 was analyzed by using an Rt-U-bond column, and all hydrocarbons apart from CH4 were analyzed using an Rt-alumina bond/Na2SO4 column.
In each catalytic test, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature of 500 °C under O2 and N2 flow. The temperature was controlled by using a thermocouple inserted into the middle of the catalyst bed. After the temperature was stabilized, the C3H8 feed was introduced and GC measurements were begun. As there is an induction period in which excess boron leaches from the catalyst surface before catalytic activity is stabilized, each catalyst was treated for 24 h under a feed of 6:3:11 C3H8:O2:N2 at 40 mL min–1. After this treatment, the gas flow rate was adjusted to give WHSV–1 values ranging from 0.6 to 6.3 kgcat s molC3H8–1 (ca. 40–200 mL min–1), and further GC measurements were performed. Reported experiments showed the carbon balance closed within ±3%.
2.3. Materials Characterization
ICP-MS
Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry measurements were performed by the Trace Elements Laboratory at the Wisconsin State Hygiene Lab, using an ICP-MS instrument outfitted with HF-resistant components. Prior to analysis, 10–15 mg of X B/SiO2 sample was digested in 100 μL of 48 wt % HF and diluted in 20 mL of Milli-Q H2O. Samples were diluted again by a factor of 50 prior to ICP-MS analysis.
IR Spectroscopy
Prior to analysis, all samples were dehydrated at 500 °C in a flow of air overnight. IR spectra were recorded on a self-supporting wafer by using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer in transmission mode (resolution of 2 cm–1). Intensities were normalized to the Si–O–Si overtones of the silica framework. Analysis was performed inside a glovebox (<1 ppm of H2O and O2).
Raman Spectroscopy
In situ Raman measurements were performed with a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer with a 785 nm excitation laser. All measurements used a 1200 lines mm–1 grating and were taken with a range of 250–1200 cm–1 and a dispersion of 1.36565 cm–1 pixel–1. Each sample was loaded in a high-temperature Linkam CCR1000 cell and heated at 10 °C/min under air to 500 °C, stopping every 100 °C to record Raman spectra. The spectra are reported without any background subtraction.
NMR (UW—Madison)
Solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker standard-bore 11.7 T (ν0(1H) = 500 MHz) NMR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Avance III console and with a Bruker 4 mm broad-band HX MAS probe. The samples were packed into a 4 mm rotor in an inert nitrogen atmosphere glovebox, and MAS experiments were performed with nitrogen gas. 1D 11B solid-state NMR spectra were obtained with a 1D double echo (DEPTH) sequence for suppression of background signals by using a composite pulse (π/2−τ–π–τ–π–τ–acquire) with a recycle delay of 4 s.
NMR (Iowa State)
Solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker wide-bore 9.4 T (ν0(1H) = 400 MHz) NMR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Avance III HD console and with a Bruker 2.5 mm broad-band HXY MAS probe. The samples were packed in to a 2.5 mm rotor after grinding to powders in an inert nitrogen atmosphere glovebox. MAS experiments were performed with nitrogen gas to prevent hydration. The spectra were collected with a MAS frequency of 25000 Hz at room temperature. 1D 11B solid-state NMR spectra were obtained with a rotor synchronized spin echo pulse sequence (π/2−τ–π–τ–acquire). The echo delays (τ) were fixed to three-rotor cycles to help suppress the probe background. CT-selective 11B rf pulse widths were calibrated with a spin echo experiment on boron nitride nanotubes obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. CT selective π/2 pulses of 8 μs which correspond to an 11B rf field of 18 kHz were used (Figure S14). 11B chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to the established chemical shift standards by using the previously reported relative NMR frequencies. (20) The SPINAL-64 scheme with an rf field of 100 kHz was used for 1H heteronuclear decoupling in the spin echo experiments. (21)1H rf pulses were directly calibrated on the samples, and the chemical shifts were referenced to neat tetramethylsilane by the use of admantane (δiso(1H) = 1.82 ppm) as a secondary chemical shift standard. All experiments on the same nucleus have been processed with the same window function parameters for a quantitative comparison of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 11B NMR spectra of catalysts were processed with 150 Hz exponential line broadening. Simulations of all MAS 11B solid-state NMR spectra were performed in the solid line shape analysis (SOLA) module v2.2.4 included in the Bruker Topspin v4.0.1 software.
The proton detected dipolar refocused insensitive nuclei enhanced by population transfer (D-RINEPT) spectra were acquired with the pulse sequence described in the previous literature. (22−24) In D-RINEPT experiments, the symmetry-based recoupling sequence supercycled (S)R412 was applied to the 1H nuclei. The rf field for the SR412 recoupling was set to 2 times the sample spinning rate to fulfill the second-order rotor resonance recoupling condition. The second-order R3 condition was precisely calibrated by varying the rf field of the spin lock pulse in a simple 1H 90° pulse–spin lock pulse sequence. The length of the recoupling sequence was optimized directly on the samples of interest, and the time providing the most intense signal was chosen. The total recoupling duration (4m × τr) was 1.28 ms. RAPT was used to enhance the sensitivity of 11B → 1H D-RINEPT NMR experiments. (25,26) RAPT was implemented with WURST pulses that were 80 μs in duration separated by 2 μs applied at frequency offsets of ±400 kHz. (27) The frequency sweep range of the WURST was 25 kHz, and the 11B rf field was ∼50 kHz.11B{1H dephased} spectra were collected with a separate local field (SLF) type pulse sequence with 8K scans and a recycle delay of 1 s. (28)SR412 dipolar recoupling was applied during the first echo delay with a 1H rf field of 50 kHz. The dipolar recoupling sequence was applied for 0.8 or 1.2 ms to dephase 11B signals that are coupled to protons.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Synthesis and Catalytic Testing of B/SiO2 for ODHP
The synthesis of silica-supported boron oxide was performed analogous to the incipient wetness impregnation of vanadium on silica. (17) A solution of triisopropyl borate (B(OiPr)3) in isopropanol was added dropwise to an amorphous silica support (Aerosil 300; BET surface area ca. 300 m2 g–1). Following the impregnation step, the material was calcined in air at 550 °C (ramp rate of 1 °C min–1) for 3 h. The concentration of B(OiPr)3 in solution was adjusted to achieve boron loadings between 0.25 and 2 wt %. Samples are named X B/SiO2 (where X = wt % B) according to their initial boron loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We emphasize that 2 wt % is the maximum boron loading that can be achieved with this preparation method. Indeed, because of the volatility of the boron precursor, any additional boron precursor that cannot readily react with the silica support will evaporate from the surface during calcination before it has a chance to anchor. Following calcination of these materials, each was tested as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) at 500 °C.
Figure 1a shows the propylene selectivity as a function of propane conversion for ODHP over the series of five different B/SiO2 catalysts. ODH experiments were performed in a fixed bed reactor under a flow of C3H8, O2, and N2 (in a molar ratio of 6:3:11) at 500 °C (see the Experimental Section for details). The materials were exposed to ODH conditions for 24 h prior to varying catalyst contact times to collect the propylene selectivity versus conversion trend and then discontinuing the experiment to perform materials characterization. The selectivity versus conversion for h-BN is also shown for comparison. The conversion–selectivity trends for each of the B/SiO2 materials appears to fall on a similar line. This line has a very similar slope to the h-BN conversion–selectivity trend; however, the overall selectivity to propylene is ca. 10% less for the B/SiO2 materials. For example, Figure 1b compares the product distributions for h-BN and 0.58 B/SiO2 at isoconversion (ca. 5% propane conversion). The overall selectivity to propylene for h-BN at this conversion is 88%, whereas the overall selectivity for 0.58 B/SiO2 is 77%. 0.58 B/SiO2 forms more ethylene (14%, compared to 7.7% for h-BN), CO (5.5% compared to 2.6% for h-BN), and CO2 (1.6% compared to 0.25% for h-BN). We attribute the lower propylene selectivity of the B/SiO2 materials to the silica support, as the presence of pure silica seems to have a deleterious effect on propylene selectivity for h-BN catalysts as well (Figure S1). Nevertheless, the catalytic behavior of the B/SiO2 materials at such low B loadings is remarkable considering that under reaction conditions bare SiO2 is inert.

(a) Propylene selectivity versus propane conversion data for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a series of B/SiO2 catalysts (0.23, 0.46, 0.58, 1.2, and 1.7 wt % B) and h-BN. Different conversions were achieved by changing the gas flow rate between 40 and 200 mL min–1. (b) Product distribution comparison at isoconversion (5% propane conversion) for h-BN and 0.58 B/SiO2.
Previous literature for supported boron oxide materials indicates that boron oxide can leach from the surface of solid oxide supports like alumina upon treatment at high temperatures. (10−14) Therefore, to assess these catalysts’ stabilities, the boron content for each sample was determined with ICP-MS after calcination of the materials (denoted “fresh”) as well as after 24 h of catalytic testing for ODHP (denoted “spent”, Figure 2). While 0.23 B/SiO2 does not appear to have any significant reduction in boron content after catalytic testing, materials with a higher initial boron loading lose a larger fraction of their original boron content. In fact, following 24 h on stream, 1.7 B/SiO2 has decreased in boron loading by approximately two-thirds to 0.65 wt % boron. While the boron content in these materials decreases somewhat drastically after the first 24 h on stream, it does not appear that this decrease continues until all boron is stripped from the catalyst surface. An analysis of the propane conversion as a function of catalyst time-on-stream shows that all of the materials reach a constant propane conversion after about 24 h and that the level of conversion correlates with the boron content after 24 h (Figure S2). We hypothesize that during this induction period the surface boron species restructure to a more stable phase (vide infra) while some weakly bound boron leaches off the surface. This, of course, warrants a detailed structural analysis of these catalysts which will be outlined in the following section.

3.2. Structural Characterization of Boron Sites on B/SiO2 Materials
Fresh and spent B/SiO2 catalysts were characterized with a combination of IR, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. A summary of identified B surface sites and the techniques used to identify them are provided in Table 1 at the end of this discussion.
Table 1. Summary of Plausible Boron Surface Structures on Fresh and Spent B/SiO2 Catalysts Based on Observations from IR, NMR, and Raman Spectroscopic Studies
Figure 3a shows the transmission IR spectra for the series of fresh B/SiO2 catalysts. All materials were dehydrated at 500 °C in air prior to analysis to assess the structure of the materials after exposure to ODH reaction temperatures. The intensities of each spectrum were normalized to the Si–O–Si overtones observed between 1500 and 2100 cm–1. The spectrum of the dehydrated Aerosil 300 support is also provided for reference. Each of the B/SiO2 materials in Figure 3a contains a stretch at 3745 and 3701 cm–1 that correspond to isolated Si–OH and B–OH vibrations, respectively. (29−31) Each spectrum also contains a shoulder at ca. 3650 cm–1 that corresponds to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups on the material, although the exact nature of the hydrogen bonding (SiOH–SiOH, SiOH–BOH, BOH–BOH, or some combination) is unclear from these spectra alone.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Normalized transmission FTIR spectra for (from bottom to top) Aerosil 300 silica, fresh 0.23, 0.46, 0.58, 1.2, and 1.7 B/SiO2 samples dehydrated at 500 °C in air. (b) Transmission IR of the same samples after propane ODH testing for 24 h (Aerosil 300 spectrum included again for comparison).
The deconvolutions of the fresh B/SiO2 IR spectra (using one broad Lorentz peak to approximate the shoulder around 3650 cm–1) are shown in the panel on the left side of Figure 3a, and a summary of the peak areas as a function of boron content is provided in Figure S3. Because these transmission IR spectra are normalized to the same features, we can use these deconvolutions to assess the differences in relative quantities of each vibrational species on these materials. As expected, the number of isolated SiOH groups decreases with increasing boron loading. We also see an increase in isolated BOH groups on the materials until 0.58 B/SiO2; after higher loadings, the area of this feature appears to decrease slightly and levels off above 0.58 wt % B.
Figure 3b shows the IR spectra for the same materials following catalytic testing for propane ODH for 24 h on stream. The spent materials are named by the same loading as their fresh counterparts (e.g., “fresh 0.46 B/SiO2” becomes “spent 0.46 B/SiO2”), although the actual boron content of the spent materials significantly decreases, as shown in Figure 2. Following catalytic testing, the spent B/SiO2 samples were dehydrated at 500 °C in air prior to IR analysis. Like the fresh materials, all of the spectra contain peaks at 3745 and 3701 cm–1 and a small shoulder at ca. 3650 cm–1. However, the relative quantities of these features are far different from their fresh counterparts. In particular, spent 0.58 B/SiO2, spent 1.2 B/SiO2, and spent 1.7 B/SiO2 have far more isolated silanols and fewer B–OH groups than their analogous fresh materials. We attribute this to the significant loss of boron on these materials (as shown in Figure 2) and subsequent regeneration of Si–OH following boron leaching from the surface. The lower loading samples, such as spent 0.23 B/SiO2 and spent 0.46 B/SiO2, still have similar relative Si–OH and B–OH peak intensities to their fresh counterparts, which we attribute to the lesser extent of boron leaching.
We utilized Raman spectroscopy to obtain complementary vibrational information about the boron sites on silica. Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra for the in situ dehydration of fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 to 500 °C in air. At ambient conditions, the Raman spectrum for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 contains peaks at 209, 500, and 882 cm–1 that match closely with vibrations observed in the Raman spectrum for boric acid (shown above the spectra for 1.2 B/SiO2 in Figure 4). The vibration at 209 cm–1 has been previously attributed to a lattice-translatory oscillation in boric acid, whereas the peaks at 500 and 882 cm–1 correspond to O–B–O bending and B–O stretching modes, respectively. (32,33) Upon dehydration of 1.2 B/SiO2 at temperatures >100 °C, these features disappear, and instead a small feature at 807 cm–1 can be observed. This is very close to the feature at 808 cm–1 observed in B2O3 (top spectrum in Figure 4). A full-intensity spectrum of the 1.2 B/SiO2 dehydrated at 400 °C is shown in Figure S4. Based on literature Raman studies of borate and borosilicate glasses, this feature is specifically attributed to the symmetric breathing mode for six-membered boroxol rings. (34,35) This feature persists in the Raman spectrum for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 upon heating to 500 °C and holding for 1 h. Additionally, this feature persists after a second cycle of hydration–dehydration (Figure S5). Interestingly, the same features are observed in the Raman spectra after dehydration of the other fresh B/SiO2 samples with loadings <1 wt % B (Figure S6).
Figure 4
Figure 4. In situ Raman study of the dehydration of fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 to 500 °C in air. The top spectrum for 1.2 B/SiO2 labeled 25 °C was taken after re-exposure of the sample to ambient conditions following dehydration. Spectra of boric acid (B(OH)3) and boron oxide (B2O3) are provided for comparison.
A similar in situ Raman dehydration study was also attempted for spent 1.2 wt % B/SiO2 (and spent 0.58 wt % B/SiO2; Figure S7). However, the representative ambient temperature Raman spectrum for spent 1.2 B/SiO2 shows only a small feature at 882 cm–1, and upon dehydration only features from the silica support can be observed. This decrease in Raman sensitivity could be due to a decreased boron loading for spent 1.2 B/SiO2 to 0.55 wt % B following catalytic testing for 24 h on stream; however, we achieved sufficient Raman sensitivity on fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 and fresh 0.58 B/SiO2 to observe the boroxol ring feature at 807 cm–1 (Figure S6). Therefore, we hypothesize that the lack of an observable feature at 807 cm–1 in the spent materials may be due to the degradation of these boroxol ring species during catalytic testing, either through the loss of boron content or by restructuring to metaborate species.
All of the fresh and spent B/SiO2 samples were also analyzed with solid-state 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR. Figure 5 shows a summary of all the 1D MAS 11B solid-state NMR spectra for the fresh (panel a) and spent (panel c) B/SiO2. The 11B solid-state NMR spectra were obtained with a double echo (DEPTH) pulse sequence to suppress NMR signals from the probe background. (36) All samples were dehydrated at 500 °C in air prior to analysis and NMR rotors were packed in a glovebox to prevent rehydration before the NMR experiments. All of the 11B NMR spectra for fresh B/SiO2 have similar features spanning from ca. 20 to 0 ppm and can be simulated with central transition 11B MAS powder patterns that are characteristic of trigonal-planar BO3 sites. The observed feature at 194.2 eV in XPS for each of these materials is also consistent with BO3 sites (Figure S8). (7) On the basis of the typical peak shape for a single three-coordinate boron site, (37) it appears that the fresh materials contain multiple types of BO3 units (i.e., coordination of both oxide and hydroxide anions to the boron).

(d) Analogous deconvolutions, 11B → 1H D-RINEPT, and 11B {1H dephased} NMR spectra for spent 0.46 B/SiO2 (loading 0.32 wt % B after catalytic testing). Spectra taken at 500 MHz (11.7 T) and 400 MHz (9.4 T) were collected with magic angle spinning (MAS) rates of 10 and 25 kHz, respectively.
Analytical simulations of these spectra were used to determine the isotropic shift (δiso; analogous to chemical shifts measured in solution NMR) and the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor parameters: the quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) and the EFG tensor asymmetry parameter (ηQ). The EFG tensor parameters provide information about the coordination environment of the 11B nuclei in the sample. We note here that the isotropic shift values can be approximated by reading the ppm value at the onset of the left side of the powder pattern (not at the center); however, analytical simulations of the spectra are needed to accurately determine the value for δiso.
Simulation of the fresh 0.46 B/SiO211B NMR spectrum (Figure 5b, top trace) fits well with two powder patterns with δiso values at 15.9 and 12.3 ppm. We note that because of the nature of the amorphous support and based on the variety of species identified (vide infra), there likely exists a small distribution of isotropic shifts. However, for ease of analysis and discussion, we simulate the 11B 1D spectra using only two peaks. The CQ values for these two patterns are 2.4 and 2.6 MHz, respectively, and ηQ for both peaks is 0. The rest of the fresh B/SiO2 materials can also be fit with two patterns where δiso = 15.8–15.9 ppm and CQ = 2.3–2.4 MHz for the first and δiso = 12.3–12.4 ppm and CQ = 2.6–2.7 MHz for the second; the main difference between the spectra of fresh B/SiO2 materials with variable B loading is that the relative integrated intensity of each pattern varies from a ratio of approximately 1:1 to 2.1:1 for the high and low shift patterns, respectively (Figure S9 and Table S1). The magnitude of CQ for both patterns indicates that all boron reside in BO3 units with trigonal-planar geometry. (38,39) We expect that the differences in δiso for the two features in the 1D 11B spectra arise from differences in number of hydroxyl groups on the boron nuclei in these materials. The presence of a hydroxyl group has a known effect on the δiso for oxidized boron species. Boric acid (B(OH)3), for example, has a reported δiso of 18.8 ppm, (40) whereas boron oxide (B2O3) has a reported δiso of 14.6. (38) Further experiments to verify these hypotheses are explained below.
We performed 11B–1H double-resonance NMR experiments on select B/SiO2 materials (0.46 B/SiO2 and 1.2 B/SiO2) to obtain further information about the structure of the oxidized boron species. The double-resonance 1H–11B NMR experiments were performed with a 400 MHz (9.4 T) NMR spectrometer, whereas the 1D MAS 11B NMR spectra in Figure 5a (and 5c) were obtained with a 500 MHz (11.7 T) NMR spectrometer, which leads to slight differences in the breadths of the 11B powder patterns. Regardless of the field used for acquisition, similar values for δiso, CQ, and ηQ were determined, validating the analytical simulations. The middle (blue) trace in Figure 5b shows a proton-detected 11B NMR spectrum obtained with the dipolar refocused insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (D-RINEPT) pulse sequence (22,23) for fresh 0.46 B/SiO2. This experiment selectively shows 11B nuclei proximate to protons which should correspond to 11B nuclei with hydroxyl groups attached (see the inset next to the D-RINEPT spectrum). Interestingly, the D-RINEPT spectrum can be fit to a peak with δiso = 15.8 ppm, CQ = 2.4 MHz, and ηQ = 0.0, which matches the high-frequency pattern obtained from simulations of the 1D spin echo spectrum acquired at 11.7 T. Based on the 500 °C dehydration temperature for this material, most of these hydroxylated boron species are expected to have only one hydroxyl group. The bottom trace in Figure 5b shows the 11B {1H dephased} spin echo spectrum for fresh 0.46 B/SiO2. This experiment gives complementary information to the D-RINEPT experiment in that it shows the 11B spectrum for 11B nuclei distant from protons (i.e., containing no hydroxyl groups; see the inset next to the 11B{1H dephased} spectrum). This spectrum can also be fit with δiso and EFG tensor parameters close to those for the low-frequency (red) pattern in the simulations of the 11B 1D spin echo NMR spectrum of fresh 0.46 B/SiO2.
On the basis of the experiments outlined above, we can conclude that the fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 materials consist of a mixture of trigonal-planar BO3 units with and without hydroxyl groups attached. We also performed the same experiments on the fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 material and observed a similar match between the features in the analytical simulation of the spin echo, D-RINEPT, and 11B {1H dephased} spectra (Figure S10 and Figure S11). Therefore, we expect that the features deconvoluted from the remaining fresh B/SiO2 1D 11B spectra all correspond to BO3 structures with and without hydroxyl groups.
A similar 11B NMR analysis was performed to evaluate the spent B/SiO2 materials. Figure 5c shows the 11B spin echo NMR spectra for the spent B/SiO2 samples following catalytic testing for propane ODH. Much like the fresh materials, the 11B spin echo NMR spectra of the spent materials can be simulated with two major features, with one example shown for spent 0.46 B/SiO2 in Figure 5d. Analytical simulations for the remaining spent materials are provided in Figure S9, and simulation parameters are summarized in Table S1. All the spent B/SiO2 materials can be simulated with one pattern with δiso = 14.8–15.0 ppm, CQ = 2.3–2.4 MHz, and ηQ = 0.0 and a second pattern with δiso = 12.1–12.4 ppm, CQ = 2.6–2.7 MHz, and ηQ = 0.0. D-RINEPT and 11B {1H dephased} spin echo NMR spectra of the spent 0.46 B/SiO2 material verify that the features in the spin echo simulation correspond to a combination of BO3 units with and without hydroxyl groups attached (Figure 5d). These structural assignments were also verified for spent 1.2 B/SiO2 (Figure S10). The slight changes in δiso, in particular for the hydroxylated BO3 species, may be indicative of restructuring of the material upon catalytic testing. This will be discussed in further detail in the following section.
3.3. Multidimensional Solid-State NMR
Aside from the observation of boroxol rings in the Raman spectra for fresh B/SiO2, thus far we only have information about the immediate bonding environment of the boron surface sites on our materials. The surface consists of trigonal-planar BO3 units with a mixture of sites with and without hydroxyl groups. Because it is difficult to resolve subtle differences in the connectivity of the boron species on the catalyst surface with 1D NMR experiments alone (i.e., are the BO3 sites mostly isolated or are they connected through bridging B–O–B moieties), we utilize a series of 2D NMR experiments on select low loading (0.46 B/SiO2) and high loading (1.2 B/SiO2) catalysts to obtain further information about the interaction between different sites on the catalyst surface.
Figure 6 displays the 2D 1H–1H double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR experiments (41,42) for fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 and 1.2 B/SiO2. This experiment selectively detects only those 1H signals proximate (dipole coupled) to other 1H nuclei. For both spectra, the SQ frequency is provided on the horizontal axis, whereas the DQ frequency is provided on the vertical axis. Signals appear in the indirect dimension at a DQ frequency equal to the sum of the SQ frequency of the two correlated 1H spins. The diagonal dotted line in both spectra represents the position on the 2D NMR contour plot in which the DQ frequency is exactly double the SQ frequency. Signals appearing on this line correspond to autocorrelations which arise when pairs of 1H spins with the same chemical shift are proximate to one another.
Figure 6
Figure 6. 2D 1H–1H double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR spectra for (a) fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 and (b) fresh 1.2 B/SiO2. 1H spin echo NMR spectra are provided on the horizontal axis of the 2D spectra for comparison. Assignments for the cross-peaks in panels a and b are color-coded to the structures in panel b. (c) 1D DQ-SQ filtered 11B NMR spectrum with structural assignment (inset).
Figure 6a shows the 2D 1H–1H DQ-SQ spectrum for fresh 0.46 B/SiO2. A 1H spin echo spectrum that displays all the 1H signals in the sample is also provided for comparison above the projection of the 1H–1H SQ frequency. The 1H spin echo spectrum for fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 shows an intense peak at 1.6 ppm and a less intense peak at 2.7 ppm that correspond to protons from isolated Si–OH and B–OH groups, respectively. Proton detected 2D 1H{29Si} cross-polarization heteronuclear correlation (CP HETCOR) (43) and 11B → 1H D-RINEPT experiments verify that the 1.6 and 2.7 ppm proton signals are proximate to 29Si and 11B nuclei, respectively (Figures S12 and S13). The 1H SQ projection of the 2D 1H DQ-SQ spectrum of 0.46 B/SiO2 shows one peak at 1 ppm and a broader peak centered at ca. 4 ppm. This spectrum represents the 1D proton spectrum filtered to display only signals from 1H spins proximate to other 1H spins. Both the 1H 1 and 4 ppm of SQ peaks exhibit DQ autocorrelations at twice the SQ chemical shift, suggesting they are proximate to other protons of the same type. On the basis of the chemical shift for each of these proton signals in the SQ frequency dimension, we attribute the cross-peak between 1 ppm 1H signals to intermolecular (through-space) DQ coherence between hydrogen-bonded Si–OH groups on the surface. However, on the basis of the IR spectrum and the 1H spin echo spectrum for this material, we know that the majority of SiOH groups on this material are isolated. By the same logic, we attribute the autocorrelation cross-peak between 4 ppm 1H signals to B–OH groups hydrogen bonded or adjacent to one another on the surface. Because some B–OH groups are sufficiently close to one another to give rise to DQ NMR signals, we expect that a subset of the hydroxylated boron species on fresh 0.46 B/SiO2 is connected by bridging oxide (B–O–B) bonds. The assignments for these cross-peaks are illustrated in Figure 6a.
Figure 6b shows the 1H–1H DQ-SQ NMR spectrum for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2. Again, the 1H spin echo for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 is provided above the horizontal axis to compare the standard 1D 1H NMR spectrum with the DQ-SQ filtered spectrum below it. The 1H spin echo spectrum for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 also contains two major peaks at 1.6 and 2.7 ppm (with a slight shoulder at higher frequencies, see below) that correspond to protons on Si–OH and B–OH groups, respectively. In 1.2 B/SiO2 the B–OH 1H NMR signal is of similar intensity as the Si–OH signal. This matches with observations of the quantities of Si–OH and B–OH vibrational species in transmission IR (Figure 3). The increased quantity of B–OH (compared to 0.46 B/SiO2) is expected given the higher boron content on the silica surface. When we examine the 2D 1H–1H DQ-SQ NMR spectrum for 1.2 B/SiO2, we observe the same autocorrelation cross-peaks between 1H signals at 1 and 4 ppm that we attribute to H-bonded Si–OH groups and H-bonded B–OH groups, respectively. We emphasize that the most intense sharp features at 1.6 and 2.7 ppm in the 1H spin echoes for 0.46 and 1.2 B/SiO2 do not appear in the DQ filtered spectrum. This indicates that there is a combination of isolated and hydrogen-bonded SiOH and BOH groups present on the surface of these materials. This observation is corroborated by the combination of sharp bands at 3745 and 3701 cm–1 and the small broad shoulder at 3650 cm–1 observed in the IR spectra for these materials (see Figure 3).
Figure 6c shows the 1D 11B DQ-filtered NMR spectrum (44,45) for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2. This experiment shows only 11B nuclei proximate to other 11B nuclei. The 11B-DQ filtered spectrum shows an 11B NMR signal that matches the high-frequency pattern of the 11B spin echo (see dotted orange spin echo spectrum overlaid on black DQ-SQ spectrum). The 11B → 1H D-RINEPT spectrum of fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 indicates the high-frequency pattern from the 11B spin echo spectrum must correspond to 11B nuclei with hydroxyl groups attached. Therefore, on the basis of the homonuclear 1H and 11B DQ NMR experiments, we conclude that some of the surface boron sites exist as H-bonded B–OH species connected by a bridging oxide group. We note here that the 11B DQ NMR experiment is highly nonquantitative and has only 1–2% efficiency as compared to an 11B spin echo NMR experiment. Therefore, although we expect the majority of boron species that are interconnected by bridging oxide bonds contain hydroxyl groups, it is still possible that to a lesser extent there are some boron species without hydroxyl groups that could be interconnected, e.g., boroxol ring species like those observed with Raman spectroscopy (Figure 4). On the basis of the NMR studies in Figure 6, it appears that the surface of the fresh B/SiO2 catalysts predominantly contain chains of interconnected 11B sites with hydroxyl groups (similar to chain-type metaborate structures observed in borate glasses (34)) at both high and low loadings, in addition to isolated boron sites.
As was described above, elemental analysis shows that after ODH catalytic testing the B/SiO2 catalysts lose some boron content, with the loss being more drastic in the samples of higher loading. We analyzed spent 0.46 B/SiO2 and 1.2 B/SiO2 samples with 1H and 11B NMR experiments to assess any structural changes on the B/SiO2 materials following catalytic testing. Both spent materials exhibit similar attributes; therefore, we will limit our discussion here to spent 0.46 B/SiO2. The analogous experiments on spent 1.2 B/SiO2 are shown in Figure S14. Like the fresh B/SiO2 materials, the spent materials contain a mixture of three-coordinate BO3 units with and without hydroxyl groups attached (Figure 5).
Figure 7a displays the 2D 11B →1H D-RINEPT NMR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. The 1D 1H spin echo spectrum is also shown on the horizontal axis. The 1H spin echo spectrum of spent 0.46 B/SiO2 shows peaks at 1.6 and 2.7 ppm that are from isolated Si–OH groups and B–OH groups attached to three coordinate BO3 units, respectively. The IR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2 also indicates there are small quantities of isolated B–OH (Figure 3). Notably, the 1H spin echo spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2 shows two additional peaks at 7 and 8.4 ppm that were absent from the spectrum of fresh 0.46 B/SiO2. The 2D 11B →1H INEPT spectrum also shows a lower intensity 1H peak at 8.4 ppm which correlates to a relatively sharp 11B NMR signal centered at ca. 0 ppm. Given the peak position and shape for this 11B feature, we attribute this signal to a four-coordinate boron signal. Therefore, we assign the 1H signal at 8.4 ppm to a hydroxyl group on a four-coordinate BO4 nucleus. Interestingly, no appreciable signal from BO4 sites are observed in the 1D 11B spectrum of spent B/SiO2 materials (Figure 5). We note that the 11B →1H INEPT experiment is nonquantitative, as different sites will have different dipolar couplings and 11B T1 and T2 relaxation times. The 11B NMR signals of the four-coordinate sites are likely absent from the 1D 11B spectra because these sites may have a long 11B T1 because of their small CQ. Hence, the four-coordinate boron species are detected in the D-RINEPT experiment but not in the 1D 11B experiment. However, we do believe the observation of these species is evidence for the restructuring of the surface boron species as a result of exposure to ODH catalytic conditions.
Figure 7
Figure 7. (a) 2D 11B → 1H D-RINEPT NMR spectra for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. Projections at different points along the spectrum are shown stacked above the total projection on the vertical axis. (b) 1H–1H double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. (c) 1D DQ-SQ filtered 11B NMR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. A proposed structural assignment for the proton signals is shown in the inset. 1H spin echo spectrum is provided on the horizontal axis of the 2D spectra in panels a and b.
A 2D 1H–1H DQ-SQ NMR experiment was also performed on spent 0.46 B/SiO2. Figure 7b shows the 1H–1H DQ-SQ NMR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. The 2D contour plot for spent 0.46 B/SiO2 still contains cross-peaks on the diagonal (where the frequency in the DQ dimension is exactly twice the SQ dimension frequency) associated with 1H signals at 1 and 4 ppm, which we again assign to H-bonded Si–OH and B–OH groups, respectively. A strong DQ coherence is observed between the peaks at 7 and 8.4 ppm (DQ dimension shift of 15.4 ppm), implying that these two hydrogen atoms are spatially proximate. The 11B → 1H D-RINEPT experiments suggest that at least one of these proton signals (at 8.4 ppm) is associated with a BO4-type species. 1H–29Si CP HETCOR experiments show that the signal at 7 ppm is not nearby the 29Si nuclei (Figure S15), nor would we expect such a high chemical shift proton signal to be associated with a Si–OH type species. (46) We suggest a potential structural assignment for these anomalous proton signals in the inset in Figure 7 based on structures proposed for on alumina-supported boron materials; (47,48) however, we suspect that the formation of these species is indicative of surface restructuring and are likely not a significant contributor to the catalytic properties of these materials. For comparison, the oxidized boron phase in hexagonal boron nitride following ODH catalytic testing does not appear to contain significant amounts of four-coordinate boron. (9)
Figure 7c contains the 1D 11B DQ filtered NMR spectrum for spent 0.46 B/SiO2. This experiment was run with the same conditions (and same number of scans) as the 11B DQ-SQ NMR spectrum for fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 in Figure 6c. The fact that this material contains ca. 25% of the boron content of fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 yet still has sufficient sensitivity to this experiment indicates that the extent of boron aggregation on these materials must be higher (for the B–OH-containing sites) than the fresh B/SiO2 materials. The breadth of the feature in the 1D 11B DQ filtered NMR spectrum also spans to lower ppm values than the 11B DQ filtered NMR spectrum reported for the fresh material shown in Figure 6c, suggesting that there are also 11B nuclei without hydroxyl groups attached in the boron oxide aggregates on the spent material. We also note that the isotropic shift of the BO3 feature for sites with B–OH groups shifts from ca. 16 ppm in the fresh materials to ca. 15 ppm in the spent materials (Figure 5 and Table S1). Previous work on borate glasses suggests that a shift to lower isotropic shifts indicates an increase in bridging oxide groups in borate materials. (38)
Through a combination of detailed IR, Raman, and NMR characterization, detailed structural information about the types of sites present on the surface of B/SiO2 materials before and after catalytic testing was obtained. Table 1 summarizes the types of plausible surface sites on fresh and spent B/SiO2 materials, along with the technique used to observe those species. In the fresh materials, we presume to have a mixture of isolated BO3 sites with and without hydroxyl groups attached, chain-type metaborate type structures containing H-bonding B–OH groups as well as some six-membered boroxol rings.
In the spent materials, we still plausibly have some isolated BO3 sites with and without hydroxyl groups, and we also observe some chain-type metaborate-type structures and a fraction of BO3OH sites. We expect that the average number of B atoms in the aggregated metaborate species is greater in the spent materials based on the shift of the features in the 1D 11B spectra to lower values for δiso (compared to the fresh material) and the increased sensitivity of the 11B DQ filtered NMR experiment in the spent material even at lower boron loadings. We do not see evidence for any appreciable amount of boroxol rings in the spent materials (based on Raman spectroscopy); therefore, we expect that these species degrade upon exposure to ODH conditions.
4. Conclusions
In this work we show that oxidized boron supported on an amorphous silica support is catalytically active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, confirming the hypothesis that the oxidized boron layer formed in situ on h-BN provides the active site. Like the h-BN and BNNTs, the B/SiO2 materials contain agglomerated oxidized boron species. However, in h-BN and BNNTs, this oxidized phase is likely an extended overlayer generated by the oxidation and hydration of boron from the bulk of the material. (18) For B/SiO2, these aggregates are simply made up of chains of BO3 units that form from the decomposition of the B(OiPr)3 precursor during calcination and from rearrangement of the surface sites during ODH catalysis and thus cannot be replenished from the bulk support as might be the case for h-BN. Because both types of active materials contain aggregates, it is possible that multiple boron nuclei in close proximity (i.e., connected by bridging oxide groups) are required for these materials to be active for ODH. Additionally, we show that there is restructuring that occurs on the surface during the ODH reaction. The supposed dynamic nature of the active phase is in line with a recent computational study that predicts a highly dynamic active phase under reaction conditions. These insights suggest that a single-site catalysis model is not valid for this system and prompts further synthetic efforts to understand the requirements for active site formation. Therefore, a careful synthetic approach to generate single-site boron species (e.g., using grafting chemistry) would be instrumental to determine whether isolated boron species are viable catalysts. A catalyst such as this with more uniform structure would also help to more clearly define an “active site” for ODH with these types of materials. This study acts as the foundational work for our understanding of supported boron oxides as ODH catalysts and will help inform strategies to synthesize catalysts with more monodisperse (i.e., having only one type) surface sites in the future. With this class of materials, we aim to work toward a more comprehensive structural understanding of the active boron species required for highly selective ODH catalysis.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Propylene selectivity versus propane conversion data for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a series of B/SiO2 catalysts (0.23, 0.46, 0.58, 1.2, and 1.7 wt % B) and h-BN. Different conversions were achieved by changing the gas flow rate between 40 and 200 mL min–1. (b) Product distribution comparison at isoconversion (5% propane conversion) for h-BN and 0.58 B/SiO2.

Figure 2. Summary of ICP-MS elemental analysis results for fresh (left bars, blue) and spent (right bars, orange) B/SiO2 catalysts.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Normalized transmission FTIR spectra for (from bottom to top) Aerosil 300 silica, fresh 0.23, 0.46, 0.58, 1.2, and 1.7 B/SiO2 samples dehydrated at 500 °C in air. (b) Transmission IR of the same samples after propane ODH testing for 24 h (Aerosil 300 spectrum included again for comparison).
Figure 4
Figure 4. In situ Raman study of the dehydration of fresh 1.2 B/SiO2 to 500 °C in air. The top spectrum for 1.2 B/SiO2 labeled 25 °C was taken after re-exposure of the sample to ambient conditions following dehydration. Spectra of boric acid (B(OH)3) and boron oxide (B2O3) are provided for comparison.
