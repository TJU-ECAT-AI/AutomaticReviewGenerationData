Abstract
Boron-based catalysts show excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to alkenes with high selectivity and extremely good antioxidation properties. However, the anti-deep-oxidation mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we chose h-BN and B2O3 as representative boron-based catalysts to investigate their reactions with two important intermediates in the light alkane ODH, Et· (evolving to ethene) and EtO· (evolving to ethene or COx), to elucidate the origin of the antioxidation of alkanes. The density functional theory calculations reveal that surface boron sites could eliminate alkoxy in their vicinity, resulting in exceptional inhibition of alkane deep-oxidation. The analysis of the electronic and geometric structures of key stationary points showed that the oxophilicity of B determined the low deep-oxidation of alkanes, and the homoleptic coordination of B with all three ligating atoms being O moderately enhanced its oxophilicity. This work represents a novel conceptual advance in the mechanistic understanding of alkane ODH.

Boron is a p-block element and is widely used in organic synthesis as a Lewis acid (1,2) or a trigger to provide radical species. (3−5) Recent recognition of its remarkable performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes extended its reach to the catalytic conversion of light alkanes to olefins which are important building blocks in the chemical industry. The pioneering work of Hermans, (6,7) Lu, (8,9) Su, (10) and co-workers represents a ground-breaking discovery in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes catalyzed by metal-free hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) which converted a widely believed chemically inert material into an ODH catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and stability in the production of olefins. Follow-up work reported the catalytic activity of various boron-based catalysts, e.g., silicon boride, (11) boron carbide, (12) boron oxide, (13−15) and boron phosphate. (16) These studies invoked a renaissance of boron chemistry and a reacquisition of its role in catalytic synthesis of chemicals, here, light olefins. (17−20)
After a half decade of exploration, it became clear that the oxygenated boron sites are key players in determining the catalytic activity in light alkane ODH of boron-based catalysts. (6,8,13,14,21−27) These studies consistently indicated that the tricoordinated oxygenated boron species (BOx or B–OH groups) were responsible for the triggering of alkane ODH, and their rich presence accessible for the feed gas benefited the enhancement of the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Meanwhile, the speciation of boron on the surface was in dynamic evolution during the alkane ODH, and the accumulation of tricoordinated B species may accelerate the reaction. (13,16) The dynamic evolution nature of the boron speciation during the ODH reaction was also reported in an AIMD simulation study. (28) However, a convincing explanation for why they showed extraordinary ability in suppressing the oxidation of olefin products was still lacking. This raised a compelling need and motivated the present study, in which the remarkable ability of boron-based ODH catalysts to inhibit deep oxidation of light alkanes was addressed fundamentally in terms of the intrinsic properties of the boron sites in the catalysts, i.e., their oxophilicity and their coordination modes.
The h-BN (zigzag edge) and boron oxide (B2O3) were considered here as representatives of boron-based catalysts. They share the similarity of their remarkable selectivity for olefin products and ability to suppress deep oxidation of alkane substrates, and differ from each other in the lower activity of h-BN than B2O3 in view of the higher activation temperature in the h-BN catalytic system than in the B2O3 catalytic system. (6,8,13) Geometrically, in both catalytic systems, B exists in its tricoordination state. The difference between them is in the coordination environment of B; that is, B is embraced in a homoleptic coordination environment in B2O3 (only O atoms, with one being hydroxyl at the constrained surface site and two being hydroxyl at the rotatable surface site), whereas it is in a heteroleptic coordination environment in h-BN (N and O with nN = 2 at the constrained surface site Bm and nN = 1 at the rotatable surface site Bt, see Scheme 1). This reminds us of the importance of turning to the oxophilicity and the coordination environment of boron for the answer to the questions on the origin of their high catalytic selectivity and low deep oxidation of alkane in ODH.

aThe superscripts m and t denoted the constrained surface (singly hydroxylated, Bm–OHm) and the rotatable surface (doubly hydroxylated, Bt–OHt) sites, respectively.
Taking advantage of their electronically localized nature (band gap: 5.6∼5.9 eV for h-BN and B2O3), (29,30) they were truncated to prepare cluster models (Scheme 1). The use of the simplified models was verified by the data of a bigger B2O3 model (see Figure S9 and Table S4). For both h-BN and B2O3, two possible active sites were considered, with one representing the constrained surface site (Bm–OH) and the other the rotatable surface site (Bt–OH). For a triply coordinated boron site, a constrained surface site means that the boron bares one hydroxyl group and a rotatable surface site with two hydroxyl groups (Scheme 1). The choice of the two catalysts was a consequence of the awareness of their difference in the ODH reaction: In both ethane and propane ODH reactions (Table 1), B2O3 exhibited higher activity (active at lower temperature) than h-BN and comparable selectivity for COx. In these two models, B atoms are different in their coordination environment, which is the focus of this study in order to determine how it may modulate their electronic properties and govern their performance in the ODH of light alkanes.

Under ODH conditions, the alkyl radical was considered to be an intermediate leading to olefin products, while the alkoxyl radical may evolve into either olefins or deep oxidation products. The deep oxidation of alkanes and the breakage of a C═C bond rely on the populated formation of alkoxyl radical; thus, the prompt elimination of the alkoxyl radical and the suppression of their existence in oxidative atmosphere is vital to maximize the olefin yield. Herein, the ethyl and ethoxyl groups were used as mimics of alkyl and alkoxyl radical intermediates in the ODH of light alkanes to evaluate the oxophilicity of the potential active sites via their substitution for the hydroxyl group at the active sites (Scheme 1):

As shown in Figure 1, the reaction of ethoxyl radical (EtO·) at the constrained surface B sites (Bm) of both h-BN and B2O3 proceeded similarly along a two-step pathway. The first step captured the gaseous ethoxyl radical (TS1) to produce a tetra-coordinated intermediate (IM), and the second step released the hydroxyl radical to recover the tricoordination mode of Bm with a planar conformation (PRO). The whole reaction accomplished the substitution of ethoxyl radical for the hydroxyl radical.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Geometries of the stationary points along the substitution reaction pathways (Å).
In view of the longer bond length of the partially formed Bm–O4 in B2O3–TS1 (1.907 Å) than in h-BN–TS1 (1.806 Å) and the shorter bond length of the partially cleaved Bm–Om in the former (1.408 Å) than in the latter, the B2O3–TS1 was an earlier transition state than h-BN–TS1. Accordingly, the free-energy barrier to the former was lower than that to the latter by 19.7 – 12.3 = 7.4 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the Hammond postulate, (32) as seen in Figure 2 where the Gibbs free-energy profiles for the substitution reactions of ethyl or ethoxyl groups for the constrained (B-OHm) and rotatable (B-OHt) hydroxyl groups in h-BN and B2O3 catalytic systems are plotted.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Gibbs free-energy profiles of the substitution reactions on (A) h-BN and (B) B2O3 calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atm.
In contrast, the substitution of ethyl radical (Et·) for the hydroxyl group at the constrained surface Bm sites was calculated to be a concerted process on both h-BN and B2O3. In the transition state (TS), the B–C1 bond was partially formed (1.609 Å in BN–TS and 1.606 Å in BO–TS), and the Bm–Om bond was nearly fully cleaved (2.276 and 2.244 Å, respectively). These data showed that the transition state in the substitution reaction of ethyl radical for the hydroxyl was a late transition state.
Accordingly, as seen in Figure 2, at the constrained surface site of h-BN, the consumption of EtO· has a free-energy barrier (19.7 kcal mol–1) much lower than that of Et· (62.7 kcal mol–1), suggesting much higher propensity for the Bm site to capture the ethoxyl group than the ethyl group. The free-energy barriers also showed that the substitution of ethoxyl group for the constrained surface hydroxyl group was feasible under the ODH condition, while that of the ethyl group was prohibited. Similar to the h-BN catalyst, the barrier to the substitution of EtO· for the hydroxyl group on the constrained boron sites of B2O3 (12.3 kcal mol–1) was calculated to be much lower than that in the case of Et· (58.1 kcal mol–1).
The substitution reactions of EtO· and Et· for the hydroxyl groups at the rotatable surface sites (Bt) of both h-BN and B2O3 followed a two-step mechanism but with different free-energy barrier heights (Figure 2, green and blue curves): the attachment of EtO·/Et· to B and the subsequent release of an OH radical, with the latter as the rate-determining step. In both h-BN and B2O3 catalytic systems, the barrier to the release of OH radical at the rotatable surface site is lower than that at the constrained surface site (31.4 vs 33.7 kcal/mol for h-BN and 21.2 vs 22.8 kcal/mol for B2O3), showing that higher presence of OH group at the B site (2 for the rotatable surface site vs. 1 for the constrained surface site) benefited the substitution reaction.
Prior to the hydroxyl release, the attachment of the EtO· and Et· radicals to the B sites was calculated to have free-energy barriers of 18.8 and 53.3 kcal mol–1 at the rotatable surface site of h-BN (Bt), respectively, and 14.07 (EtO·) and 48.3 (Et·) kcal mol–1, respectively, at the rotatable surface site of B2O3 (Bt), both showing reactivity higher than at the constrained surface site of corresponding catalysts (Figure 2).
Besides the difference between the two catalytic systems, they have similarities. In all of the reactions studied here, the rate-determining step was featured by the breaking of the B–OH bond, and the whole process was endothermic with larger endothermicity on h-BN than on B2O3.
The above analysis indicated that both the constrained surface B site and the rotatable surface B site displayed stronger affinity for oxygenated alkyl group than for alkyl group. This is in accord with the property of B that its oxides are much more stable than its alkylated species, which are often used as an alkyl radical reservoir in organic synthesis. (3−5)
The population analysis (Figure S4) showed that along the substitution reactions of EtO· for hydroxyl group on h-BN and B2O3, the spin density did not accumulate at the boron site where the leaving OH groups stood but mainly distributed on the oxygen atoms of the ethoxy radical in RC, which was transferred to the oxygen atoms of the leaving hydroxyl radical in Prod.
In the two transition states (TS1 and TS2), where the B-OEt bond was partially formed and the B–OH bond was partially cleaved, and in the intermediate (IM), the spin density mainly resided on the two atoms involved in the bond that was evolving. This showed that in both catalytic systems, the electron density was in nature localized and confined in the region of the active site. This is consistent with the property of h-BN and B2O3 as insulators. (29,30) The difference between the two catalytic systems was that the localization feature of the spin density was more significant in B2O3 than in h-BN until the formation of the tetra-coordinated intermediate (IM) while the opposite was true during the dissociation of the B–OH bond (TS2) (Figure S4). This showed that during the two sequential steps, the coordination environment of the B2O3 bred transition state (TS1) that was closer to the reactant (RC) than to the corresponding product (IM), i.e., the higher presence of O atoms (three) in the first coordination shell of B offered an earlier transition state than the heterolepticity both in view of geometry and population. Accordingly, the free-energy barriers to the reactions on B2O3 were lower than those in the h-BN catalytic system.
The competitive binding of B–OH, B–C2H5, and B–OC2H5 were also analyzed by the bond energy and the nature of key species and active site to understand the substitution mechanisms (Figure 3).

(F) The delocalization indices (DI) of the bonds between Bm (h-BN) and C in −CH2CH3 (B–C), N in h-BN (B–N), O in −OC2H5 (B-OC2H5), and O in −OH (B–OH) and their contribution from σ-bond, pπ-pπ back-bonding, and others.
In view of the stronger bond energies of B–X (X = O, C) in B2O3 than those in h-BN by ca. 6 kcal/mol (constrained surface site Bm) (Figure 3A), homolepticity with three ligating O atoms constructed a more stable local environment of B in comparison to the heterolepticity with two ligating N atoms and one ligating O atom. This agrees with that in nature boron existed predominantly as oxyanion, implicating its strong preference to be oxidized thermodynamically.
The analysis of the condensed Fukui functions also showed both nucleo- and electrophilicity of the B site of the two catalysts with the former slightly stronger than the latter (higher S–/S+ than S+/S– in Figure 3D), showing its chameleon-like behavior. Its nucleophilicity was attributed to the ability of B to contribute electrons for bonding due to its weaker electronegativity (2.00 in Pauling scale) in comparison to carbon (2.55), nitrogen (3.04), and oxygen (3.44), and its electrophilicity was attributed to its ability to accommodate external electrons in its empty 2pz orbital. The slightly stronger nucleophilicity indicates that the B site could adsorb electrophilic radicals.
At the tricoordinated planar B site, the fourth ligand accesses B from the direction perpendicular to the planar B site, in which the 2pz orbital of B plays a key role in accommodating the incoming ligand. The analysis of the electrostatic potential in the axial direction of B showed that though both B2O3 and h-BN have negative potential above the B sites, it was less negative in the B2O3 catalytic system than in the h-BN system (Figure 3B), which is in accord with the marginally more positive atomic charge on B in B2O3 than that in h-BN (Figure 3C). In the meantime, the atomic charge of the O atom in ·OC2H5 was more negative than that of the C atoms in ·C2H5 (Figure 3C), indicating that there was stronger electrostatic attraction between the B site and the incoming ethoxy radical than between the B site and the ethyl radical, which is consistent with the lower free-energy barrier to the formation of B-OEt bond than to the formation of B-Et bond.
Among the key intermediates (·OC2H5, ·CH2CH3, and ·OH), ·OC2H5 shows stronger electrophilic activity in view of its higher relative electrophilicity (S+/S–) (Figure 3E). The matching of the nucleophilicity of the catalyst and the electrophilicity of the ·OC2H5 supports that the catalyst prefers to absorb the surrounding ethoxyl to suppress the formation of carbon oxides.
Another factor is the oxophilicity of the boron site, which may be characterized by the B–O bond strength and its covalency component analysis with respect to that of B–C and B–N bonds (Figure 3A,F). The B–OH bond is stronger than the B–OC2H5 bond, which is consistent with the endothermic feature of the substitution reaction (Figure 2).
The interaction between boron and the coordinating C, N, and O atoms was characterized to feature σ-bonding. Furthermore, in B–N and B–O bonds, there were also significant contribution from pπ–pπ interaction (Figure 3F). The contribution of σ-bonding interaction decreased in the order of B–C > B–N > B–O bonds because of the increasing electronegativity difference between the two atoms in each bond pair (B–C, 0.55; B–N, 1.04; B–O, 1.44), resulting in reduced σ orbital overlap and stronger bond polarity. The contribution of π-bonding displayed an opposite trend owing to growing 2pz electron density from C to N to O.
NBO analysis shows both σ and π interactions between B and O atoms in the B–O bond, implicating the double bonding between them (Table S3). This also reveals that boron favors staying in the polar environment (with N and O than with C) resulting from more π-electron backdonation.
An ideal catalyst has two features: (1) long-standing high activity to catalyze the conversion of reactants to targeted products and (2) ability to suppress the formation of byproducts, either by blocking the site-reaction pathway or by inhibiting the consumption of targeted products to byproducts. In the ODH reaction of light alkanes, boron-based catalysts are nearly equally active as the extensively studied metal/metal oxide catalysts, but significantly superior over the latter in the suppression of deep oxidation of olefin products to CO or CO2 in oxidative atmosphere. This work reveals the origin of such a specific ability of boron-based catalysts and has implications to experimental studies in two aspects: (A) Comparison of the substitution reactions of ethyl and ethoxyl radicals for the hydroxyl group at the B sites showed that the oxophilicity of boron enables its stronger scavenging ability for alkoxyl intermediates than for alkyl radicals. Enhancement of the oxophilicity of the active site thus may benefit the elimination of the oxygenated species to suppress the overoxidation of alkane. (B) Besides the impact of the oxophilicity of boron on the elimination of oxygenated alkyls, the coordination environment of boron also tuned the reactivity of the oxygenated boron sites. This was manifested in two aspects: on one hand, the reactivity of B2O3 being higher than that of BN, with boron homoleptically coordinated with three ligating O atoms in the former while heteroleptically coordinated with two ligand N and one O atom in the latter; on the other hand, the higher propensity of the B2O3 to consume ethoxyl than ethyl. This implicated that in the development of novel catalysts, either with doping, embedding, or other strategies, the creation of a coordination environment to accommodate homoleptically coordinated B atoms, each with three ligating O atoms, may benefit optimal catalytic performance.
In the present work, the ethyl and ethoxy were used to mimic the alkyl and alkoxyl intermediates in the ODH of light alkanes. Such treatment is qualified in view of the electronic structure of light alkanes. In an unsubstituted saturated aliphatic alkane, the reactivity of one site is mainly influenced by its close neighboring sites but hardly by the remote sites. This means that the ethyl, propyl, and butyl may work as mimics mutually in the evaluation of the reactivity of their terminal radical sites. Compared to ethane, propane and other alkanes with longer chain or more side-chains introduce mainly degrees of freedom of conformational flexibility, which need to be addressed by molecular dynamics simulations and are expected to have little influence on the elementary steps considered in this work, and the finding obtained in our present study holds in the ODH of propane and butane.
In summary, the constrained surface and rotatable surface boron atoms of boron-based catalysts are identified to adsorb the surrounding alkoxyl by radical substitution reactions to suppress deep oxidation. The oxophilicity of boron dominates this process because of the pπ–pπ contribution of the B–O bond, and the homolepticity of boron facilitates this process.

This work is dedicated to Prof. Dr. Walter Thiel. Working with Prof. Thiel during 2004–2007 at the Max-Planck Institut für Kohlenforschung, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany is one of the key stages in my career, which in some sense shaped my current research interest. In 2019, at the symposium in Beijing in honor of his 70th birthday, I briefly introduced him to my group’s research, and he showed special interest in my computational study of the boron-based alkane ODH reaction. We then made an appointment that I would talk about my work systematically ten years later at the symposium in honor of his 80th birthday. His unexpected passing made this impossible. By dedicating this work to Prof. Thiel, I express my deep gratitude for his guidance and wish him peace.
