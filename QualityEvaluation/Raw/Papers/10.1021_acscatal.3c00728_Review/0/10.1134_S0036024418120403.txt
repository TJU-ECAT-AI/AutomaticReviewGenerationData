Abstract
A systematic analysis was performed of the physicochemical properties of amorphous silicas (Acros, Degussa, KSKG) and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared from them with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 wt % chromium. The supports and catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst. The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UV–Vis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium.
