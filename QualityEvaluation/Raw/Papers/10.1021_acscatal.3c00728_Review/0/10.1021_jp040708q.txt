Abstract
The structure and catalytic properties of binary dispersed oxide structures prepared by sequential deposition of VOx and MoOx or VOx and CrOx on Al2O3 were examined using Raman and UV−visible spectroscopies, the dynamics of stoichiometric reduction in H2, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. VOx domains on Al2O3 modified by an equivalent MoOx monolayer led to dispersed binary structures at all surface densities. MoOx layers led to higher reactivity for VOx domains present at low VOx surface densities by replacing V−O−Al structures with more reactive V−O−Mo species. At higher surface densities, V−O−V structures in prevalent polyvanadates were replaced with less reactive V−O−Mo, leading to lower reducibility and oxidative dehydrogenation rates. Raman, reduction, and UV−visible data indicate that polyvanadates predominant on Al2O3 convert to dispersed binary oxide structures when MoOx is deposited before or after VOx deposition; these structures are less reducible and show higher UV−visible absorption energies than polyvanadate structures on Al2O3. The deposition sequence in binary Mo−V catalysts did not lead to significant differences in structure or catalytic rates, suggesting that the two active oxide components become intimately mixed. The deposition of CrOx on Al2O3 led to more reactive VOx domains than those deposited on pure Al2O3 at similar VOx surface densities. At all surface densities, the replacement of V−O−Al or V−O−V structures with V−O−Cr increased the reducibility and catalytic reactivity of VOx domains; it also led to higher propene selectivities via the selective inhibition of secondary C3H6 combustion pathways, prevalent in VOx−Al2O3, and of C3H8 combustion routes that lead to low alkene selectivities on CrOx−Al2O3. VOx and CrOx mix significantly during synthesis or thermal treatment to form CrVO4 domains. The deposition sequence, however, influences catalytic selectivities and reduction rates, suggesting the retention of some of the component deposited last as unmixed domains exposed at catalyst surfaces. These findings suggest that the reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be modified significantly by the formation of binary dispersed structures. VOx−CrOx structures, in particular, lead to higher oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities than do VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports.

1. Introduction
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane provides an attractive route for the synthesis of propene. 1-15 This reaction occurs on oxides of V, 16-31 Mo,19,23,38-44 and Cr, 39-46 with V-based catalysts typically providing higher rates and propene selectivities.19,23 Supports influence rates and selectivities on dispersed VOx domains.17,20 For example, VOx supported on ZrO216,30,31 is highly active but gives low propene selectivities, while VOx/Al2O3 gives lower rates but much higher alkene selectivities.17,20
ODH reactions on supported VOx catalysts involve redox cycles and kinetically relevant C−H bond activation steps that require electron transfer from O to V within VOx domains.18,19,23,35,47 Chen et al.23 showed that ODH turnover rates increase with decreasing VOx UV−visible absorption edge energies and with increasing reducibility of VOx domains in H2. ODH turnover rates increased as polyvanadates became the predominant VOx species, suggesting that linkages between monovanadate structures and support cations decrease the reactivity and reducibility of V−oxo species. These data also suggested that an intervening layer of a more reducible oxide (MOx) may minimize these support effects by replacing V−O-support linkages with more reactive V−O−M linkages.
Few such binary dispersed oxide catalysts have been reported. Gao et al. 48 and Liu et al. 49 reported the catalytic properties of V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 for CH3OH oxidation and VOx/SnOx/Al2O3 for CH3OCH3 oxidation, respectively. In both studies, the intervening layer increased the reducibility and catalytic activity of VOx domains. Such binary dispersed structures have also been examined for ODH reactions. Cherian et al.40 reported that VOx structures on Al2O3 and TiO2 supported modified by CrOx gave higher rates but lower propene selectivities than catalysts containing only VOx domains on these supports. The latter study reported a single composition, without systematic examination of any structural implications and catalytic consequences of compositional changes. Dai et al. 50 described a series of binary dispersed VOx/MoOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by dispersing VOx on Al2O3 modified by a nominal polymolybdate monolayer. For a given VOx surface density, active structures on MoOx-coated Al2O3 were more reducible than those on Al2O3, apparently because less reactive V−O−Al linkages are replaced with V−O−Mo bonds; these trends were also reflected in the higher propane ODH turnover rates measured on VOx structures dispersed in MoOx/Al2O3 relative to those on similar VOx domains on pure Al2O3 supports. MoOx interlayers also decreased primary and secondary combustion rates and led to higher propene selectivities. In contrast, Bañares and Khatib 51 found no synergistic effects in VOx−MoOx/Al2O3 samples prepared by coimpregnation, which contained Mo−V−O mixed phases at (Mo + V) surface densities above those required for two-dimensional oxo-oligomers on Al2O3 surfaces.
Here, we aim to probe the structure and catalytic function of binary dispersed oxide catalysts for alkane ODH reactions. Samples were prepared by dispersing VOx species on Al2O3 support surfaces modified by Mo and Cr oxides and also by preparing “inverse bilayers”, in which Mo and Cr oxides are dispersed on Al2O3 modified by a polyvanadate monolayer. The resulting structures were examined by Raman and UV−visible spectroscopies and by measurements of their reduction dynamics in H2, and their catalytic function was determined by rigorous measurements of turnover rates and of rate constants for primary and secondary reactions.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Synthesis of Binary Dispersed Structures on Al2O3. Fumed Al2O3 (Degussa AG; surface area 107 m2/g) was contacted with deionized water, dried at 383 K for 72 h, and treated in ambient air at 823 K for 3 h before use in a process intended to strengthen aggregates; its BET surface area was 125 m2/g after this treatment. MoOx/Al2O3 (MoAl) and CrOx/Al2O3 (CrAl) with various active oxide surface densities were prepared by impregnating Al2O3 with solutions of molybdenyl acetylacetonate (Alfa Aesar, 99%) in acetone (Aldrich, 99.5%) or with aqueous solutions of chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Aldrich, 98%). Samples were then dried at 383 K in ambient air overnight and treated in flowing dry air (Airgas, zero grade, 3.33 cm3 s-1) by heating to 773 K at 0.167 K s-1 and then holding at 773 K for 2 h. VOx/Al2O3 (VAl) was prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of Al2O3 with 2-propanol (Aldrich, 99.99%) solutions of vanadyl isopropoxide (Aldrich, 98%); samples were kept in a N2 flow within a glovebox overnight and transferred into a quartz reactor sealed with stopcocks at each end. These samples were treated at 393 K in flowing N2 (Airgas, 99.999%, 1.67 cm3 s-1) for 1 h and at 573 K for 1 h; air (Airgas, zero grade, 1.67 cm3 s-1) was then introduced and samples were held at 573 K for 1 h and at 773 K for 2 h.
Binary dispersed VOx/MoOx/Al2O3 (VMoAl) and VOx/CrOx/Al2O3 (VCrAl) catalysts were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of MoAl or CrAl samples with 2-propanol solutions of vanadyl isopropoxide with the same procedures used for VAl. MoOx/VOx/Al2O3 (MoVAl) catalysts with varying MoO3 contents were prepared by impregnation of 10%V2O5/Al2O3 with acetone solutions of molybdenyl acetylacetonate, and then treating them at 383 K in ambient air and in flowing dry air at 773 K for 2 h. A 12%Cr2O3/10%V2O5/Al2O3 (12Cr10VAl) sample was prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of 10%V2O5/Al2O3 with aqueous chromium(III) nitrate solutions, followed by drying at 383 K in ambient air and treatment in flowing dry air at 773 K for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization. BET surface areas were measured using Quantasorb units (Quantasorb 1 or Quantasorb 6 Surface Analyzers, Quantachrome Corp.) and N2 at its normal boiling point. Samples were treated in dynamic vacuum (0.1 Pa) at 393 K for at least 3 h before BET measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were measured with a Siemens D5000 unit at ambient temperature using Cu Kα radiation. The X-ray tube was operated at 45 kV and 35 mA, and the scan rate was 1.2°/min.
Raman spectra were collected using a Hololab Series 5000 spectrometer (Kaiser Optical) equipped with a frequency-doubled 75-mW Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). Samples were pressed into self-supported wafers (0.9 cm diameter, ∼50 mg cm-2) at 200 MPa and then held onto a rotating holder within a quartz Raman cell. Raman spectra were recorded at ambient temperature before and after treating samples in flowing dry air (Airgas, zero grade, 0.83 cm3 s-1) while heating to 673 K at 0.167 K s-1 and holding at 673 K for 1 h.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies were carried out in a flow unit (QS-10, Quantachrome Corp.). H2 concentrations were measured using a thermal conductivity detector calibrated by reducing CuO. The sample amount (15−100 mg) was chosen to maintain a constant number of removable oxygen atoms (equivalent to 5 mg of MoO3). Samples were heated to 1173 K in 20%H2−Ar (Praxair, 99.999%) at 0.167 K s-1 and held at 1173 K for 1 h. H2O reduction products were removed before thermal conductivity detection with a 13X sieve at ambient temperature.
Diffuse reflectance UV−visible spectra were collected with a Cary 4 spectrophotometer (Varian Corp.) equipped with a Harrick Scientific diffuse reflectance attachment (DRP-XXX) and an environmental chamber (DRA-2CR). Samples were treated in 20% O2−He (Praxair, 99.999%, 0.83 cm3 s-1) at 723 K for 0.5 h before measurements. The Kubelka−Munk function (F(R∞)) was used to convert reflectance data into pseudoabsorbance using MgO as a reflective standard. 52,53 Absorption-edge energies were calculated from the x-intercept of a linear regression of [(F(R∞))hν]1/2 data versus hν. 53
2.3. Catalytic Rates and Selectivity Measurements. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were measured at 583−673 K using a quartz flow microreactor. The reactor is 50 cm long, and the catalyst section is 10 mm in diameter and 35 mm in length. The reactor was heated via an electrical furnace, and the temperature was set by a temperature controller (WATLOW) and measured by a K-type thermocouple inserted into the reactor and positioned within the catalyst bed. Temperature gradients were avoided by diluting catalyst samples (20−40 mg, 250−500 μm) with equal amounts of acid-washed quartz (250−500 μm). C3H8 (13.5 kPa, Airgas, 99.9%) and O2 (1.7 kPa, Airgas, 99.999%) with He as balance (Airgas, 99.999%) were used as reactants. C3H8 and O2 conversions were kept below 2% and 20%, respectively, by varying reactant flow rates. Space velocities were 30 000−500 000 cm3 g-1 h-1. Reactant and product concentrations were measured by chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 6890) using a Carboxen 1004 packed column connected to a thermal conductivity detector and HP-PLOT Q capillary column with a flame ionization detector.
Reactor residence time effects on rates and selectivities were used to estimate C3H8 dehydrogenation (r1) and combustion (r2) rates by extrapolating C3H6 and COx synthesis rates to zero residence time. C3H6 combustion rates (r3) were obtained from the slope of C3H6 selectivity data as a function of residence time.16-23 These primary and secondary reactions and their respective rate constants (k1, k2, k3) are shown in the scheme below:
Dehydrogenation and combustion rates are assumed to be first-order in C3H8 and C3H6 and zero-order in O2, as found experimentally on MoOx and VOx catalysts.16-21 Values of k2/k1 are calculated from primary selectivities (SC3H60) using
while k3 is obtained from C3H6 selectivities using
where τ is the residence time and Cv is the number of V-atoms per unit volume.17
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalyst Characterization. 3.1.1. Surface Areas and Structure of Catalysts. Surface areas and VOx surface densities for all samples, as well as their designated nomenclature, are shown in Tables 1−3. Surface areas of VAl samples decreased with increasing VOx content and surface density (Table 1), as was also found for VOx dispersed on Al2O3 containing a nominal monolayer of MoOx (12MoAl) or CrOx (12CrAl). Surface areas for VMoAl and VCrAl with similar VOx surface densities but varying MoOx or CrOx contents also decreased with increasing MoOx and CrOx content (Tables 2 and 3). These changes in surface areas merely reflect the larger total mass of samples per amount of Al2O3 in each sample; surface areas per amount of Al2O3 (Tables 1−3) are essentially the same in all samples. Thus, dispersing active oxides, as monolayers or bilayers, does not influence Al2O3 surface area.

Figure 1 shows X-ray diffraction data for selected samples. Pure Al2O3 shows only lines for its γ-phase, which is the only phase detected in 10VAl, 12MoAl, and 12CrAl. 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl showed lines for AlVMoO7 and weaker lines for Mo6V9O40 and MoV2O8. Only γ-Al2O3 was detected in 10V12CrAl and 12Cr10VAl.

Assignments of diffraction peaks are based on the following PDF numbers:  γ-alumina (PDF#10-0425), AlVMoO7 (PDF#46-0687), Mo6V9O40 (PDF#34-0527), and MoV2O8 (PDF#74-0050).
Figure 2 shows Raman spectra at ambient temperature for VAl samples with a range of VOx surface densities treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h, and denoted as dehydrated samples throughout. The band at 1033 cm-1 was assigned to VO stretches in monovanadates and polyvanadates, and the broad 750−1000 cm-1 bands were assigned to V−O−V stretches in two-dimensional polyvanadates.20,22,54-56 Crystalline V2O5 gives sharp intense Raman bands at 1002, 708, 535, 490, 410, 305, 289, 203, and 150 cm-1.2 At low VOx surface densities (1.9 V/nm2), the ratio of the 1033 cm-1 band intensity (VO stretch) to that for the 946 cm-1 band (V−O−V stretch) is high, indicating that monovanadates predominate on these samples. Polyvanadates become evident from emerging bands at 700−1000 cm-1 as VOx surface density increases from 1.9 to 8.7 V/nm2. Crystalline V2O5 was detected at high VOx surface density (>8 V/nm2) from its two bands at 1002 and 708 cm-1, consistent with saturation of polyvanadate monolayers at 7−8 V/nm2. 57 Raman scattering cross sections for bulk V2O5 are ∼10 times larger than for monovanadates. 58 Thus, dispersed VOx species remain predominant in 15VAl and 18VAl samples.
Figure 2 Raman spectra of xVAl (x = 3−18). Samples were treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h.
Raman spectra for dehydrated 12MoAl and V-coated 12MoAl samples with various VOx surface densities (xV12MoAl, x = 3−15; 1.6−9.7 V/nm2) are shown in Figure 3. 12MoAl showed bands at 1013 and 842 cm-1, attributed to MoO and Mo−O−Mo stretches, respectively.36,59-61 Raman bands for crystalline MoO3 were not detected on samples prepared using molybdenyl acetylacetonate as the precursor and a surface density of 5.0 Mo/nm2, corresponding to approximately one monolayer. 62 In contrast, MoAl samples prepared with ammonium heptamolybdate showed crystalline MoO3 bands at surface densities above 4.5 Mo/nm2.36,50 Only a small unresolved band at 1034 cm-1, assigned to VO stretches, appeared when VOx was deposited on 12MoAl at low surface densities (Figure 3, 3V12MoAl; 1.6 V/nm2). Higher VOx surface densities led to two new bands at 771 and 239 cm-1, together with a more intense band at 1013 cm-1, which was also present in the spectrum for 12MoAl. The 771 cm-1 band was previously assigned to Mo−O−V stretches in molybdovanadates.50,51 The intensities for the bands at 1013, 771, and 239 cm-1 change to similar extents with increasing VOx surface density; thus, they appear to arise from a common V−Mo oxo-structure containing V−O−Mo linkages. A definitive assignment is not possible, but their sharp nature and concurrent appearance with AlMoVO7 diffraction lines in 10V12MoAl (Figure 1) suggest that they arise from this crystalline phase. The 10V12MoAl sample, which contains an equivalent VOx monolayer on Al2O3 precoated with a similar equivalent MoOx monolayer, showed the most intense bands at 1013, 771, and 239 cm-1 (Figure 3), consistent with intimate mixing between VOx and MoOx species. Raman bands at 705 and 1002 cm-1 for crystalline V2O5 were detected at VOx surface densities of 9.7 V/nm2 (15V12MoAl).
Figure 3 Raman spectra of 12MoAl and xV12MoAl (x = 3−15) treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h.
Raman spectra for 10VxMoAl (x = 4−20) samples, which contain an equivalent VOx monolayer on Al2O3 supports modified by varying amounts of MoOx, are shown in Figure 4. Raman spectra for 10V4MoAl (Figure 4) and 10VAl (Figure 2) are similar. Bands at 1013, 771, and 239 cm-1, corresponding to V−Mo−(Al)−O phases, were detected as MoOx surface density increased; these bands reached maximum intensities for 10V12MoAl, which contains equivalent monolayers of both VOx and MoOx components. Diffraction patterns suggest here also that these new bands arise from crystalline AlVMoO7 structures. Crystalline MoO3 was detected at surface densities above 6.9 Mo/nm2. The 1043 cm-1 band for VO stretching modes in monovanadates and polyvanadates decreased monotonically with increasing MoOx surface density. Traces of crystalline V2O5 were detected on 10V8MoAl and 10V16MoAl. The residual coexistence of crystalline V2O5 and MoO3 in 10V16MoAl indicates that V−Mo−O phases form more readily from dispersed MoOx and VOx than from crystalline V2O5 and MoO3 at this treatment temperature.
Figure 4 Raman spectra of 10VxMoAl (x = 4−20) catalysts treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h.
MoOx species were supported on Al2O3 precoated with an equivalent VOx monolayer in an effort to explore the effects of deposition sequence on the structure and function of dispersed binary oxides. Figure 5 shows that a mixed V−Mo−O phase is present in 12Mo10VAl and 20Mo10VAl (bands at 1013, 771, and 239 cm-1), but its characteristic bands are less intense than for similar compositions prepared via the reverse sequence (Figure 4; 10V12MoAl). Crystalline V2O5 was detected in 4Mo10VAl and 12Mo10VAl, possibly because of the detachment and recrystallization of dispersed VOx structures during subsequent impregnation with MoOx precursors. As MoOx surface densities exceed one equivalent MoOx monolayer in 20Mo10VAl, intense bands appear at 1000, 823, 680, and 320 cm-1, corresponding to crystalline MoO3.
Figure 5 Raman spectra of xMo10VAl (x = 4−20) samples treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h.
Figure 6 shows Raman spectra for 12CrAl and xV12CrAl (x = 3−15; 2.1−9.5 V/nm2) samples, which contain an equivalent CrOx monolayer (7.9 Cr/nm2). 63 Polychromates, with Raman bands at 750−900 cm-1, are the predominant structures for CrOx species supported on pure Al2O3, especially at CrOx surface densities above 3 Cr/nm2.55,56,64,65 The 12CrAl sample shows three intense bands at 1009, 879, and 799 cm-1. The 1009 cm-1 band arises from symmetric stretches in the OCrO group within chromates, while the 879 and 799 cm-1 bands reflect Cr−O−Cr stretches in dichromates and trichromates, respectively.56,64 The weak band at 986 cm-1 is assigned to CrO3 (bands at 975 and 495 cm-1),56 but crystalline Cr2O3 (with a band at 550 cm-1) was not detected in any of the samples.39, 56
Figure 6 Raman spectra of 12CrAl and xV12CrAl (x = 3−15) treated in flowing dry air at 673 K for 1 h.
Raman bands at 1009, 986, 879, and 799 cm-1 weakened upon addition of VOx to 12CrAl samples and were ultimately replaced by a band at 1037 cm-1 assigned to VO stretches and by two broad bands at 940 and 820 cm-1. The broad nature of these two latter bands suggests that they arise from well-dispersed structures. Definitive assignment of the band at 940 cm-1 is not possible. It appears at a frequency similar to that for orthorhombic CrVO4 (924 cm-1), 66,67 but the absence of corresponding diffraction lines suggests that it exists as disordered and highly dispersed CrVO4 domains, which tend to form at low temperature. 68-70 The origin of the 830 cm-1 band is unclear; it may reflect the presence of polychromates, polyvanadates, or mixed V−O−Cr oligomers. Crystalline V2O5 was not detected, even at the highest VOx surface density (15V12CrAl; 9.4 V/nm2).
Figure 7 shows Raman spectra for 10VAl and 10VxCrAl (x = 1−15) samples with an equivalent VOx monolayer dispersed on CrAl supports at varying CrOx surface densities. The relative intensities of bands at 700−1000 cm-1 change with increasing Cr content. Bands at 786 and 890 cm-1 in 10VAl became weaker, while the 930 cm-1 band became stronger, possibly due to CrVO4 formation. Only the 820 and 930 cm-1 bands remained at CrOx surface densities above 3.7 Cr/nm2. The replacement of multiple bands for polyvanadates in 10VAl (Figure 2) with two bands at 820 and 930 cm-1 in xV12CrAl (x = 7−15) suggests that VOx species formed CrVO4 species or dispersed more uniformly on CrOx−Al2O3 than on pure Al2O3 supports.

Mixed Mo−O−V structures were detected on both 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl. The spectra for 10V12CrAl and 12Cr10VAl are very similar, suggesting that the binary dispersed oxide structures formed are essentially independent of deposition sequence. Both spectra show a band at 930 cm-1, similar to that observed in CrVO4 (924 cm-1).66,67

3.1.2. Reduction of the Catalysts. Figure 9a shows reduction profiles for 10VAl, 12MoAl, 10V12MoAl, 12CrAl, and 10V12CrAl. The 10VAl sample shows a peak at 710 K with a shoulder at 745 K, previously assigned to reduction of V5+ to V3+ in various polyvanadates,23,50 and consistent with multiple Raman bands at 700−1000 cm-1 in 10VAl (Figure 2). The 12MoAl sample shows a peak at 716 K, attributed to Mo6+ reduction to Mo4+ in dispersed MoOx, and another peak at 1033 K, corresponding to Mo4+ reduction to Mo0.23,50,71 The H2/Mo ratios for the reduction peaks at 716 and 1033 K are 0.86 and 2.02, respectively, consistent with their respective assignments.

The reduction profile for 10V12MoAl also shows two peaks; the first peak (788 K) is attributed to the simultaneous reduction of Mo6+ and V5+ in V−Mo−O structures to Mo4+ and V3+, respectively, while the peak at 1000 K reflects the reduction of Mo4+ to Mo0. The reduction profiles for 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl are very similar (Figure 10a) except for a slightly lower temperature for the first reduction peak in 12Mo10VAl (760 vs 786 K). Table 4 lists the assignments of each reduction peak and the moles of H2 consumed per mole of metal. This table also shows the expected (stoichiometric) consumption of H2 in each case. Measured H2 consumption ratios are very similar to those expected for each reduction peak and for the total extent of reduction in 12MoAl, 10VAl, 10V12MoAl, and 12Mo10VAl samples.

Reduction profiles for 12CrAl and 10V12CrAl are shown in Figure 9a; their interpretation is more complex than from Mo−V systems, because of the tendency of CrOx structures to autoreduce to various extents during thermal treatments. The peak at 578 K for 12CrAl corresponds to reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+.39,40 Table 4 shows, however, that measured H2 consumptions for reduction of CrOx species are smaller than expected for the reduction of all Cr atoms in the sample from Cr6+ to Cr3+, suggesting that only ∼60% of Cr cations exist as Cr6+ in 12CrAl after thermal treatment in air. This proposal was confirmed by the fraction of the Cr as Cr6+ in xCrAl (x = 1−12) (see Figure A of Supporting Information); in these samples, the fraction of the Cr as Cr6+ decreased monotonically from unity to 0.6 as x increased from 1 to 12 (i.e., 0.5−8 Cr/nm2). Oxide supports stabilize surface chromate species in hexavalent form, but Cr atoms in excess of those required for a polychromate monolayer form a three-dimensional structure that reduces to trivalent species to form Cr2O3 during thermal treatment in air.64,72-74 Our findings indicate that such Cr3+ structures start to form at CrOx surface densities above >2 Cr/nm2.
The 10V12CrAl samples show two overlapping reduction features at 578 and 693 K, which were assigned to CrOx and VOx reduction, respectively. The CrOx reduction peak in 10V12CrAl appears as a small shoulder next to the VOx reduction peak, even though the number of lattice oxygens associated with VOx and CrOx in this sample are similar, indicating that the fraction of the Cr atoms as Cr6+ in 10V12CrAl is significantly smaller than that in 12CrAl. In contrast, all V5+ reduce to V3+ in this sample. These data indicate that the deposition of a nominal monolayer of VOx on 12CrAl leads to the reaction of most CrOx species with VOx to form dispersed CrVO4 during thermal treatment.

Reduction profiles for 12Cr10VAl and 10V12CrAl (Figure 10b) show that the CrOx reduction peak at 572 K is smaller in the latter sample. Consistent with this, Table 4 shows that the fraction of the Cr atoms present as Cr6+ is higher in 12Cr10VAl than in 10V12CrAl; this indicates that 12Cr10VAl contains a smaller fraction of the CrOx as CrVO4 than 10V12CrAl. This may be the reason that the reactivity of 12Cr10VAl is more similar to 12CrAl rather than 10VAl, as we report in the next section. The reduction profiles in Figure 9a indicate that VOx species reduce faster in 10V12CrAl than in 10VAl, while the MoOx layer in 10V12MoAl leads to slower VOx reduction than in 10VAl. Arrhenius plots of the initial H2 consumption rates obtained during the early stages of the stoichiometric reduction of these oxides in H2 (<15% reduction) are shown in Figure 9b. The initial H2 consumption rates in 10V12CrAl are higher than in 10VAl at all temperatures, while rates in 10V12MoAl are lower than in VAl. We expect and indeed find significant catalytic consequences of these reducibility trends for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, as we discuss below.
3.1.3. UV−Visible Characterization. UV−visible spectra are shown in Figure 11 for 10VAl, 10V12MoAl, and 10V12CrAl. The spectra for 10VAl and 10V12MoAl are similar and show an absorption feature at 3.1 eV, while 10V12CrAl shows more intense absorption features, including two at 1.8 and 2.5 eV, corresponding to d−d transitions in Cr3+ centers and charge transfer in polychromates,39,64 without detectable spectral contributions from V5+.
UV−visible edge energies for 10VAl and 10V12MoAl samples are 2.25 and 2.40 eV, respectively. A previous study23 reported that ODH turnover rates increased with decreasing absorption edge energy; thus, 10VAl would be expected to show lower ODH rates than 10V12MoAl, as found experimentally and reported below. The 10V12CrAl sample does not show an absorption edge, apparently because it occurs below 1.5 eV.
In summary, Raman, reduction, and UV−visible data indicate that polyvanadate structures predominate in VAl samples. Mixed metal oxides form when MoOx is placed below or above VOx, which leads to less reducible oxides and to higher absorption edge energies than in VAl. Raman and reduction results also show that most CrOx species react with VOx to form CrVO4 when VOx is deposited over a nominal CrOx monolayer on Al2O3, but that some CrOx remains unreacted when it is deposited over a nominal monolayer of VOx on Al2O3.
3.2. Oxidative Dehydrogenation Rates and Selectivities. Rates normalized by catalyst mass are shown in Figure 12 for C3H8 conversion and C3H6 formation on xVAl, xV12MoAl, and xV12CrAl as a function of VOx surface density. As reported previously,22 ODH rates on xVAl increase with increasing VOx surface density and reach constant values at ∼7 V/nm2. These trends reflect the higher VOx content and specific reactivity with increasing surface density, as more reactive polyvanadates replace less active and reducible monovanadate structures.23
VOx surface density effects on primary ODH rates (per V-atom) and selectivities and on rate constant ratios are shown in Figure 13 for xVAl, xV12MoAl, and xV12CrAl. For xV12MoAl and xV12CrAl, catalytic contributions from the part of the surface not covered by VOx species were subtracted from measured rates and residual VOx contributions were normalized by the V-atoms in each sample. This procedure assumes that the fraction of the support covered by VOx is proportional to VOx surface density up to 7 V/nm2 and that exposed Mo- and Cr-coated surfaces catalyze reactions with rates similar to those on 12MoAl and 12CrAl samples.
Primary rates for propane conversion and propene synthesis increased with increasing VOx surface density and reached maximum values at ∼7 V/nm2 on xVAl (Figure 13a and b), corresponding to an equivalent polyvanadate monolayer, as reported previously.22 This trend reflects the higher reactivity of oligomeric VOx species relative to VOx monomers as the VOx coverage increases and is consistent with a concurrent decrease in absorption-edge energies and an increase in the rate of stoichiometric VOx reduction with H2.
Figure 13d and e shows that k2/k1 ratios increase and k3/k1 ratios decrease with increasing VOx surface density on xVAl. These trends reflect the increasing propensity for propane to undergo combustion as the surface of alumina is covered by vanadia, and the tendency for propene to react less readily with increasing vanadia coverage. The latter trend is a consequence of the reduction in exposed alumina surface, on which are present Brφnsted acid sites. A decrease in the exposure of such sites to the gas phase lowers the ease of readsorption of the newly formed olefin.
Effects of VOx surface density on primary ODH rates (per V-atom) are also observed on xV12MoAl and xV12CrAl. At low VOx surface densities (<3 V/nm2), rates on xV12MoAl and xV12CrAl are similar and higher than on xVAl. At higher VOx surface densities, rates on xV12MoAl become lower than on xVAl. This behavior appears to reflect the mixing of V and Mo species, leading to the replacement of V−O−V structures with less reactive V−O−Mo structures. Below 3 V/nm2, monovanadates prevail on both Al2O3 and 12MoAl surfaces (Figure 3) and V−O−Al species in xVAl are thus replaced, at least in part, by V−O−Mo, leading to greater reducibility and ODH reaction rates. Above 3 V/nm2, polyvanadates form on xVAl, while mixed oxides form on xV12MoAl, leading to a net replacement of more reactive V−O−V species with less reactive V−O−Mo structures. Thus, active catalytic structures in polyvanadates are rendered less active by dilution with Mo−oxo linkages. This interpretation is consistent with the lower reduction rates and higher reduction peak temperature in 10V12MoAl than on 10VAl for samples containing predominantly polyvanadate and oligomeric Mo−O−V structures (Figure 9).
These effects of mixed VOx and MoOx structures differ from those reported previously;50 that study reported that 10V12MoAl shows higher ODH rates (per V-atom) than 10VAl. These differences reflect the use of different VOx precursors used to prepare 10VAl (ammonium metavanadate) and 10V12MoAl (vanadyl isopropoxide) in the previous study.50 Figure 14 shows Raman spectra for 12MoAl, 10.5VAl, and 10V12MoAl reported previously50 and for identical compositions prepared by the methods used here (see Experimental Section). The use of ammonium heptamolydate and ammonium metavanadate as precursors led to low MoOx and VOx dispersions on alumina, as evidenced by the appearance of bands for MoO3 and V2O5 in these samples.50 The bands for oligomeric MoOx and VOx are also less intense than those observed in the samples prepared for the present study. On the other hand, the samples of 10V12MoAl prepared previously50 exhibit a Raman spectrum very similar to that reported here, with clear evidence for Mo−O−V structures (1013, 771, and 239 cm-1 bands). Thus, the higher ODH rates (per V-atom) reported earlier for 10V12MoAl relative to 10VAl are due predominantly to differences in synthetic methods. The results and conclusions in the present study are consistent with those of Bañares and Khatib,51 who found no synergistic effects in VOx−MoOx/Al2O3 samples prepared by coimpregnation of V and Mo precursors.
Figure 13d shows that k2/k1 values are much lower on xV12MoAl than on xVAl, especially for VOx surface densities above 5 V/nm2. Values of k3/k1 are lower on xV12MoAl than on xVAl for VOx surface densities below 4 V/nm2, but these trends are reversed at higher VOx surface densities. At low surface densities, these effects reflect the coverage of MoOx species by more selective VOx domains, as shown by the higher value of k3/k1 measured for a MoOx monolayer on Al2O3 than for a similar VOx monolayer (Figure 13e). Thus, partial coverage of 12MoAl surfaces by VOx would lead to the observed initial decrease in k3/k1 values with increasing surface density in xV12MoAl samples. These effects are ultimately reversed as mixing of the VOx and MoOx structures occurs with increasing VOx surface density, a process that leads to higher k3/k1 ratios.
Primary ODH rates (per V-atom) on xV12CrAl exceed those on xVAl, even after subtracting contributions from exposed 12CrAl surfaces, at all VOx surface densities (Figure 13). Both Raman spectra and reduction profiles for xV12CrAl indicate that VOx increases the fraction of CrOx that forms CrVO4. Therefore, the higher specific ODH rates per V-atom of xV12CrAl relative to xVAl are attributed to the formation of V−O−Cr structures, which replace V−O−Al sites at low VOx surface densities. The value of k2/k1 on 12CrAl (1.1) is higher than on 10VAl (0.2) and decreases with increasing VOx surface density up to 3 V/nm2 (Figure 13d). Above this V-content, k2/k1 increases with VOx surface density as in xVAl samples. Thus, the blocking of CrOx oligomers, with high propane combustion reactivity, by VOx reduces their contribution to combustion pathways, presumably because an increasing fraction of exposed surfaces consist of VOx or VCrOx domains. In contrast, values of k3/k1 are very low on 12CrAl, and VOx deposition leads to higher values at low VOx surface densities, but ultimately to a decrease similar to that observed on xVAl as VCrOx species form with increasing surface density.
The interpretations of the effects of MoOx and CrOx underlayers on the structure and catalytic properties of VOx domains presented above are consistent with the data in Figure 15 for samples in which an equivalent VOx monolayer is deposited onto an Al2O3 surface partly or fully covered by MoOx or CrOx. Partial MoOx coverages decreased ODH rate (per V-atom) because Mo−O−V bonds are less reactive than the V−O−V bonds prevalent in 10VAl at these VOx surface densities. With increasing MoOx surface density, k2/k1 decreases and k3/k1 increases. This is consistent with the lower k2/k1 values and higher k3/k1 ratios on MoOx than VOx domains (Figure 13). Partial coverage of Al2O3 by CrOx leads to effects opposite to those observed for equivalent MoOx coverages. ODH rates (per V-atom) increased monotonically, while k2/k1 increased and k3/k1 decreased, with increasing CrOx surface density.
Temperature effects on propane consumption, propene selectivity, and k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios are shown in Figure 16 for similar VOx monolayers in 10VAl, 10V12MoAl, and 10V/12CrAl. At all temperatures, the rate of propane conversion is higher for VOx dispersed on 12CrAl than on Al2O3, while VOx deposited onto 12MoAl leads to lower rates than on Al2O3. Propene selectivities are highest on 10V12MoAl and lowest on 10V12CrAl, with 10VAl giving intermediate values. On all three catalysts, propane consumption rates increased and propene selectivities decreased with increasing temperature; the latter reflects the observed increase in k2/k1 with temperature, which arises from slightly higher activation energy for combustion than for dehydrogenation of propane. In contrast, k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing temperature, as expected from the lower activation energies involved in cleaving allylic C−H groups in propene as compared to those required for activation of stronger methylene C−H bonds in propane.19 Temperature effects on k2/k1 are stronger on 10V12MoAl than on 10VAl or 10V12CrAl samples, but temperature effects on k3/k1 are more marked on 10V12CrAl than on 10VAl or 10V12MoAl.
The extent of mixing between an equivalent VOx monolayer and supports coated with MoOx or CrOx monolayers was probed by reversing the order of layer deposition. The effects of deposition sequence on dehydrogenation rates and on k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios are shown as a function of temperature in Figure 17. Dehydrogenation rates (per mass) are 1.3 times higher at 673 K when MoOx was deposited first. Below 635 K, k2/k1 is lower on 10V12MoAl than on 12Mo10VAl, but it becomes larger above 635 K, because of the stronger effects of temperature on k2/k1 on the 10V12MoAl sample. Values of k3/k1 are very similar on 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl, although the value of k3/k1 for 10V12MoAl decreases somewhat more rapidly with increasing temperature. These effects of deposition sequence reflect significant but incomplete mixing between VOx and MoOx monolayers. Raman spectra for 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl showed bands for mixed Mo−O−V structures (Figure 8), especially when MoOx is deposited first (10V12MoAl), but their reduction profiles are very similar (Figure 10). These data, taken together with the observed catalytic consequences of deposition sequence (Figure 17), indicate that significant mixing occurs during deposition or subsequent thermal treatment in VOx−MoOx binary dispersed oxide samples. The small remaining catalytic differences between 10V12MoAl and 12Mo10VAl reflect the presence of small amounts of VOx at 10V12MoAl surfaces and small amounts of MoOx at 12Mo10VAl surfaces.
For binary dispersed oxide samples containing equivalent monolayers of VOx and CrOx, the rate of propane ODH (per mass) is 1.5 times higher when CrOx is deposited first (10V12CrAl) instead of VOx (12Cr10VAl). The effects of temperature on k2/k1 are strongly influenced by the sequence of deposition; k2/k1 increases with temperature on 10V12CrAl, as was also found on 10VAl, but shows the opposite trend on 12Cr10VAl, as was also observed on 12CrAl. These effects of deposition sequence suggest that the surfaces of these dispersed binary oxides retain some of the properties of the oxide deposited last, even though most VOx and CrOx species interact to form mixed oxides, for example, CrVO4. Values of k3/k1 are higher on 10V12CrAl than on 12Cr10VAl and decrease with temperature on both samples. These data also suggest the predominant exposure of the oxide deposited last, because k3/k1 values are lower on 12CrAl than on 10VAl (Figure 13), and both samples show a decrease in k3/k1 ratios with increasing temperature (10VAl in Figure 16, temperature effects on 12CrAl not shown). These catalytic consequences of deposition order are much stronger than any structural changes detectable in their Raman spectra (Figure 8), from which it is not possible to assess the extent of mixing in 10V12CrAl and 12Cr10VAl. Reduction profiles for these two samples, however, provide definitive evidence for mixing of VOx and CrOx components in these samples. The reduction peak at 572 K (Figure 9), attributable to reduction of exposed CrOx (Figure 8), is more pronounced in 12Cr10VAl than in 10V12CrAl, suggesting that CrOx is preferentially exposed at the surface of 12Cr10VAl, consistent with the observed catalytic consequences of the deposition sequence.
4. Conclusions
The deposition of vanadia on alumina covered by an equivalent monolayer of molybdena produces well-dispersed VOx domains at low V surface densities and results in the formation of a mixed metal oxide (AlMoVO4) at higher V surface densities. This mixed metal oxide is less readily reducible than the polyvandate species that form on the surface of alumina at an equivalent monolayer coverage. For V surface densities below 3 V/nm2, the specific activity of VMoAl catalysts for propane ODH is higher than that of VAl catalysts, but above this surface coverage the reverse relationship is observed. The ratio of the rate coefficients for propane combustion to ODH (k2/k1) is significantly lower for VMoAl catalysts than for VAl catalysts, but the ratio of rate coefficients for propene combustion to propane ODH (k3/k1) is more nearly comparable. No significant difference in structure or catalytic activity and selectivity was observed when the order of molybdena and vanadia deposition was reversed, suggesting that the two active oxides are intimately mixed. Deposition of vanadia on alumina covered by an equivalent monolayer of chromia produced well-dispersed CrVO4 species at all vanadia surface coverages. The reducibility of an equivalent monolayer of vanadia dispersed on the chromia-coated alumina is higher than that for an equivalent monolayer of vanadia on alumina. The propane ODH activity of such VCrAl catalysts is higher than that for VAl catalysts at all surface concentrations of vanadia. While the ratio of rate coefficients for propane combustion to ODH (k2/k1) is larger for VCrAl catalysts than for VAl catalysts, the ratio of the rates coefficients for propene combustion to propane ODH (k3/k1) is much lower for the former catalysts. For VCrAl catalysts, the order of deposition of the components affected the catalytic properties of the material formed. This suggests that some of the component last deposited on the surface remains not fully mixed with the component first deposited. The results of this study demonstrate the relationships between the structure and reactivity of binary dispersed oxides of vanadia and molybdena and of vanadia and chromia and illustrate strategies that can be used to prepare more active and selective alkane ODH catalysts.
