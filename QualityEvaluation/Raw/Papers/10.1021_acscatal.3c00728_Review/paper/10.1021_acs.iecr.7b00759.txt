Abstract
This article presents the kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene over VOx/CaO and VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts in the absence of gas phase oxygen. In addition to their catalytic role, the catalysts also serve as the source of lattice oxygen. XRD and temperature-programmed reduction analysis indicate the availability of different types of VOx species on the prepared catalyst surfaces. The presence of CaO influences the formation of VOx species, the reducibility, and the oxygen carrying capacity of the catalysts. All these have a significant influence on propylene selectivity. The ODH of propane experiments are conducted in a CREC Riser Simulator under circulating fluidized bed conditions. It is observed that VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 displays higher propylene selectivity (94.1%) and lower selectivity of CO2 due to it is moderate active site–support interactions. The reaction network and Langmuir–Hinshelwood type kinetics model is developed using a wide-ranging set of experiments. The availability of reactive lattice oxygen is expressed by a decay model. Nonlinear regression is employed to estimate activation energies with their respective confidence intervals. The developed model satisfactorily predicted product compositions under various operating conditions. For propylene formation, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 requires lower activation energy (120.3 kJ/mol) than that of VOx/CaO (126.7 kJ/mol). On the contrary, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 needs higher activation energies (55.2 kJ/mol) for undesired CO2 formation as compared to the activation energies for CO2 formation using VOx/CaO catalyst (32.8 kJ/mol). These values are consistent with the product selectivity as observed in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

1 Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications. (1) It was first produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, which could not meet the market demand for propylene. (2) Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum feedstocks are the other sources of propylene. (3, 4) Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency. (5) In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand. (4) In addition, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas/refinery gases makes propylene production less expensive via the ODH route. (4, 5) The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity. (4, 5) Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions. (6, 7)
Appropriate reactor selection is an important aspect for developing commercial scale ODH of propane technology. (3, 5) In this regard, the fluidized bed processes are more advantageous than the fixed bed processes. (3, 5) The major advantages of a fluidized bed include less/no mass transfer limitations, uniform reaction temperature, and the possibility of catalyst regeneration. The present author and his collaborators investigated a circulating fluidized bed ODH process for ethane and propane using solid phase oxygen as the source of oxidation agent. (3, 5, 8-11) In this arrangement, the catalyst acts as a source of lattice oxygen in addition to its traditional catalytic role. After reaction, the reduced catalyst needs to be regenerated by circulating through a regenerator, maintained oxidative (air) environment, and appropriate reaction conditions. (8-11)
The outstanding challenge of the after mentioned process is the development of a fluidizable catalyst with appreciable activity and oxygen carrying capacity. Generally, vanadium based catalysts show good selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. (3, 4, 12) Alumina and silica based materials are good supports to achieve the required fluidizability of the VOx based catalysts. However, the interaction between alumina and VOx forms complex species, which are less selective to propylene. (3, 12) On the other hand, the performance of the VOx based catalysts can be improved by controlling their surface morphology and acid–base properties. (13-21)
Keeping this in mind, a mixed γAl2O3/CaO support is synthesized to achieve the appropriate balance between metal and support functionality. It is expected that the modification of the support by CaO will alter the level of acidity of alumina that minimizes VOx–support interaction. The moderate VOx–support interaction facilitates efficient surface processes (propane adsorption–reaction–products desorption). (22) In addition to the support modification, the present investigation also considered the kinetics of the solid phase ODH of propane over VOx/CaO-Al2O3 to gain a better understanding of the CaO modification effects. In the literature, several models have been studied to describe the oxidative dehydrogenation of lighter hydrocarbons to olefins. (23-30) For example, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism and Langmuir–Hinshelwood equations are developed to study the kinetics of ODH on a VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. (31) In another study, Eley–Rideal mechanism was applied to represent the kinetics of both ethane and propane using a VOx/SiO2 catalyst. (32) A two-sites Eley–Rideal redox model was able to predict the partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene and the partial ethane oxidation over MoV. (32) In particular, the ethane ODH over Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides kinetics was studied using a Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism. (33) The kinetic model was able to predict the ODH catalyst performance well.
This article mainly presents the reaction mechanism and the kinetics of ODH of propane over VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts. The reaction network and Langmuir–Hinshelwood type kinetics model is developed using a wide-ranging set of catalytic experiments conducted in a fluidized CREC fluidized Riser Simulator. The developed phenomenological kinetic model is coupled with depletion of lattice phase oxygen using a decay model as a function of propane conversion. The developed system of differential equations and experimental data are used to estimate the kinetic parameters implemented in MATLAB. The estimated kinetics parameters are further examined for the thermodynamic consistency and physical significances. The accuracy of the parameters was further evaluated by various statistical indicators.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
In this study γAl2O3 (specific surface area 150 m2/g; Inframat Advanced Materials, UK) and CaO (specific surface area 5 m2/g; Loba Chemie, India) were used as catalyst supports. Before metal loading, both the support materials were treated in nitrogen at 500 °C for 4 h to remove any volatile materials that might be present in the received samples. On the treated supports, 10 wt % vanadium was deposited following an impregnation method using ethanol as a solvent. The resultant mixture was filtered under vacuum conditions. The filtrated samples were then allowed to dry naturally. Residual ethanol was removed by drying the sample at 100 o C for 24 h. The dried catalyst samples were then placed in a fluidized bed furnace for reduction under hydrogen (10% H2 and balanced Ar) at 500 °C. Finally, the reduced samples were reoxidized by switching the gas supply to air. The oxidized samples color became yellow, indicating the presence of VOx on the surface of the support materials. Both VOx/CaO and VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts were prepared following the same above steps. In both catalysts, vanadium loading was maintained at 10 wt % and VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst was prepared using CaO to γAl2O3 ratios of 1 (one).
2.2 Catalyst Characterization
2.2.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The textural properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD analysis. The XRD experiments were conducted using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation of 1.5406 × 10–1 nm wavelength, 50 mA electrical current, 10 kV electrical voltage, and 2° scan per minute (normal scan rate) within the 2θ range from 10°–90° with step size of 0.02.
2.2.2 Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR)
The reducibility and the oxygen carrying capacity of the prepared catalysts were characterized by H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reductions) experiments using a Micrometrics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer. In each experiment, 100–200 mg of catalyst sample was placed inside a U-shaped quartz tube, which was connected to reducing and carrier gases. The catalyst samples were first pretreated under inert gas flow in order to remove any remaining volatile materials. Following pretreatment, the catalyst samples were oxidized by circulating oxygen (5% O2 and balanced He) while heating at a rate of 10 °C/min up to 500 °C. The samples were then allowed to cool down to room temperature under inert flow. The H2-TPR analysis were conducted by heating the sample (10 °C/min) under hydrogen flow (10% H2 and balanced Ar) at 50 cm3/min. In order to achieve maximum reduction, the samples were heated up to 800 °C. The hydrogen consumptions were monitored with a calibrated thermal conductivity detector (TCD) available at the exit terminal of the reducing gas.
2.3 Kinetics Experiments
The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane experiments were performed using a CREC Riser Simulator operated under turbulent fluidized conditions. The CREC Reactor Simulator is a bench scale batch reactor with a capacity of 53 cm3. (34) It can be operated in both fixed and fluidized bed modes. The schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.

The desired reactor temperatures were obtained by adjusting a temperature controller. Feed propane was injected in the reactor by using a preloaded syringe. Following the feed injection, the reaction took place for a prespecified reaction time. After each ODH run, the catalysts were regenerated by circulating air, given that solid catalysts also serve as the source of oxygen for the ODH of propane. The product gas was analyzed using an online GC equipped with a TCD (6Ft 1/8 2 mm HayeSep Q 80/100 Ni) to detect carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane, and a FID (HP AL/S (8 μm) analytical column; dimension: 25 m × 0.32 mm) to detect propane, propylene, ethane, ethylene, and methane. Propane conversion and product selectivity were calculated according to eq 1 an eq 2, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 XRD Analysis
The XRD patterns of both the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts are shown in Figure 2. For the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample, γAl2O3 peaks appeared at 2θ angles of 48° and 67°. The peaks that appeared at 32°, 38°, and 55° can be attributed to CaO. (3, 35) The 19.5° peak on both the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts can be ascribed to V2O5 crystals. VOx/CaO samples also show a small V2O5 peak at 2θ angles of above 60°. These observations indicate that both the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO samples contain VOx species, which appear mainly as a highly dispersed amorphous phase. (36) Both samples show no indication of reaction between the support and vanadium.

3.2 Reducibility and Oxygen Carrying Capacity
As mentioned before, the present study considered ODH of propane using lattice oxygen of the catalysts. Therefore, the reduction characteristics of the catalysts are very important in addition to their catalytic properties. TPR analysis was conducted to determine the reducibility and oxygen carrying capacity of the prepared catalysts. The TPR profiles also provide information about the activation temperature of the catalyst at which the lattice oxygen is available for reaction. Figure 3 shows the reduction behavior of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts over the studied reduction temperature range (25–800 °C). One can see that the VOx/CaO sample gives two wide peaks at 95–287 °C and 300–430 °C. On the other hand, the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample gives one wide peak between 260 and 450 °C. These wide peaks are possibly due to the reduction of the highly reducible VOx species available on the surface of the supports. Further, the low temperature peak of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample is less prominent than that with the VOx/CaO sample. Usually, the surface VOx species are more selective to COx formation when they react with propane/propylene. (3, 6, 8, 19) Therefore, CaO modified CaO-γAl2O3 support has more interaction with VOx than that of γAl2O; consequently, they become increasingly difficult to reduce at lower temperature. (37, 38) In both the catalysts, the major reduction peak appeared around 520–590 °C, which is mainly due to the reduction of monomeric and polymeric VOx species. These difficult to reduce VOx species are more selective to propylene formation when reacted with propane. (3, 12, 16) One should also note the VOx/CaO sample shows the highest peak temperature at 583 °C, which was shifted to 560 °C with the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample. Therefore, the introduction of CaO decreased the support surface acidity, and as a result, this enhances the formation of isolated monovanadate species on the support surfaces. (39, 40)

In addition to the active species, their quantity is also important in order to secure enough lattice oxygen for the ODH reaction. The percent of reduction with respect to total available VOx was calculated from the amount of hydrogen consumed during the TPR cycles of each catalyst sample and using eq 3.

Figure 4 presents the percentage of VOx reduction over repeated reduction and reoxidation cycles. One can see from this figure that both samples show stable reduction behavior over the repeated redox cycles. However, the percentage of VOx reduction with VOx/CaO is higher (70 ± 1.9%) than that of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample (62 ± 2.3%). This observation suggests that under the studied reduction temperature range 25–800 °C the oxygen carrying capacity of VOx/CaO is higher than that of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst. It is important to note here that VOx reduces at lower temperature, as observed with the VOx/CaO sample, which is more selective toward CO2 formation (during the ODH process). (3, 8-10)

3.3 ODH of Propane Using Catalyst Lattice Oxygen
Before the actual catalytic runs, blank experiments were carried out by injecting propane into the reactor at different temperatures. In the thermal runs, no significant propane conversion was observed. The actual ODH of propane experiments with catalysts were conducted under a wide range of reaction conditions (550–640 °C and 10–31 s reaction time) in order to demonstrate the effects of various parameters on the product selectivity and propane conversion. After each ODH cycle, the catalysts were reoxidized by circulating air for 20 min. Thus, the alternative ODHs of propane catalyst reoxidation were attained using the same reactor without any circulating of the catalyst bed. In order to verify the consistency, experiments were repeated under various reactions conditions. The calculated propane conversion and product selectivity in the experimental repeats are found to be within 2.5% standard deviation. After each experimental run, mass balances were also carried out, and it was found that they are consistently closed in excess of 96%. Table 1 reports the product analysis of the ODH of propane over VOx/CaO and VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts. One can see from this table that propylene and carbon dioxide are the major products of the ODH of propane under gas phase oxygen free reaction conditions. In addition, trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide were also detected as undesired products. It is interesting to see that VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 shows significantly higher propylene selectivity and lower carbon dioxide selectivity than those of the VOx/CaO catalyst sample. With VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst, propylene selectivity reached 94.1%, while the highest propylene selectivity with VOx/CaO catalyst is 77.2%. The higher propylene selectivity of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 sample is consistent with the XRD and TPR results, which shows the difficulties of the reduction of the VOx species on the mixed CaO-γAl2O3 support. Thus, the proper balance of CaO/Al2O3 influences the VOx dispersion, forming more isolated noncrystalline VOx species, which favors the propylene formation and suppresses the complete oxidation to CO2.

Based on the above, under the studied reaction conditions one can consider the following main reactions:
Desired reaction

Undesired reactions

(8)
Therefore, one has to be cautious selecting the reaction conditions in order to achieve the highest propylene selectivity and suppress the undesired carbon dioxide formation. To take into account all of the possibilities, the kinetics experiments were conducted at different temperatures (550, 580, 610, and 640 °C) and reaction times (10, 17, 24, and 31 s). Figure 5 depicts propylene and CO2 selectivity as a function of propane conversion at a constant reaction temperature of 640 °C, while the reaction time varied from 10 to 31 s. One can see a slight increase in CO2 selectivity with an increase in propane conversions. This also shows a slight decrease in propylene selectivity with an increase in propane conversions.

Based on the experimental observations and previous studies of our research team, (8-11) a sound approach is to propose an “In Series–Parallel Reaction Network” involving three reactions as shown in Figure 6: (i) the desired oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and water, (ii) the undesired primary combustion of propane to carbon oxides and water, and (iii) the undesired secondary combustion of propylene to carbon oxides and water. The desired ODH of propane and the undesired secondary combustion of propylene are in series while the desired propane ODH and the undesired primary combustion of propane are in parallel.

4 Kinetic Modeling
4.1 Reaction Mechanism and Rates
In the context of the present gas phase oxygen free ODH of propane study, it is assumed that there are two types of oxygen species available on the catalyst: (i) surface oxygen and (ii) subsurface lattice oxygen. The lattice oxygen provides more control toward desired propylene formation, and the surface oxygen mainly gives undesired COx. (8-11, 41) According to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, both propane and propylene are considered to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface. (41, 42) The Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism during the ODH of propane can be explained using the conceptual mechanism presented in Figure 7. According to this mechanism, there are two catalyst sites, namely catalyst support-based site-2, [V2], and surface lattice oxygen in an oxidized site-1, [V1o]. The adsorbed propane reacts with the lattice oxygen in an oxidized site-1, [V1o], to give propylene. The lattice oxygen also reacts with adsorbed propane and adsorbed propylene product to give carbon oxides.
Figure 7

On the basis of this, the following elementary steps are considered:
Adsorption of propane on a catalyst support-based site-2 [V2] on the catalyst surface:
(9)
Surface reactions
(10)
(11)
(12)
Desorption of products
(13)
Regeneration of the reduced catalyst
(14)
According for the above mechanism, the reaction rates were formulated as follows:
(15)
(16)
(17)
where θC3H8 and θC3H6 are the surface coverage of adsorbed species of propane and propylene, respectively; r1, r2, and r3 are the reaction rates of propane ODH, primary combustion of propane, and secondary propylene product combustion, respectively; and k1, k2, and k3 are the specific reaction rate constants of propane ODH, primary combustion of propane, and secondary propylene product combustion, respectively. The fractional coverage of propane and propylene can be expressed as follows:
(18)
(19)
where C1 and C2 are the concentrations of propane and propylene, respectively. The term (1 – α) represents the remaining oxidized vanadium sites or the available degree of oxidation of the catalyst. An expression that is based on the fraction of the original oxygen remaining after the propane ODH reaction was used to give allowance for the catalyst’s time on stream. The expression can be termed as the time dependent degree of oxidation of ODH catalyst, and it is expected to decrease for consecutive reactions provided there is no in situ catalyst regeneration. (41) Previously, the present author and his collaborators developed an exponential decay function to take into account the activity decay of the catalyst. (41, 43, 44) In the context of the present study, the following relation represents the catalyst degree of oxidation as a function of the conversion of propane.
(20)
where the fractional conversion of propane is denoted by XC3H8 and λ is the decay constant. In addition to the above catalyst lattice oxygen depletion (eq 20), one could speculate catalyst deactivation due to carbonation of CaO with product CO2 (CaO + CO2 = CaCO3). However, the present ODH of propane involving catalyst lattice oxygen followed by catalyst reoxidation cycles showed no sign of deactivation due to CaCO3 formation.
By substituting eqs 18, 19, and 20 into eqs 15, 16, and 17, the following rate expressions can be obtained:
(21)
(22)
(23)
4.2 Model Formulation
The CREC Riser Simulator can be considered a well mixed batch reactor as reported by de Lasa (1992). (34) Thus, the reaction rates can be expressed as
Rate of disappearance of propane
(24)
Rate of formation of propylene
(25)
Rate of formation of COx
(26)
Since a catalytic reaction is considered, weight of catalyst (Wc) and volume of reactor (Vr) could be introduced into the above equation.
(27)
The concentration of any species can be treated as a function of its mass fraction.
(28)
(29)
(30)
where W1, y1, y2, and y3 are the mass of the propane feed, and the mass fractions of propane, propylene, and carbon oxide, respectively.
(31)
(32)
(33)
The intrinsic rate constant can be evaluated from the Arrhenius equation.
(34)
where ki0 and Ei are the pre-exponential factor and activation energy of reaction i, respectively. T0 is referred to as the centering temperature, which is the average of all the temperatures for the experiment in order to reduce parameter interaction. The adsorption equilibrium constant can also be obtained from the thermodynamic relation given below.
(35)
where ki0 and ΔHi are the pre-exponential factor and heat of adsorption of species i, respectively.
4.3 Model Evaluation
The model equations (eq 31–eq 33) incorporating the individual reaction steps, Arrhenius relation, temperature dependence form of the equilibrium adsorption constants, and deactivation function were evaluated by a least-squares fitting of the kinetic parameters using the experimental data for the ODH of propane to propylene obtained from the CREC Riser Simulator. The differential equations were solved by the Runge–Kutta–Gill method (MATLAB ODE 45 subroutine). On the other hand, the modified Marquad method technique (MATLAB LSQCURVEFIT subroutine) was employed for parameter estimation. The minimum sum of squares of the residuals was set as the optimization criteria, which was defined by
(36)
The convergence of the model function was set at a tolerance limit of 10–8. In model discrimination, the following criteria are considered:
(i) The values of all the kinetics parameters (specific reaction rates and activation energies) should be consistent with the thermodynamic constraints and physical principles.
(ii) Coefficient of determination (R2).
(iii) Lowest SSR (sum of the squares of the residuals).
(iv) The confidence intervals for the model parameters should be small.
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the comparison between the experimental data and model predictions for the composition profiles of reactant and different product species using VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts, respectively. One can notice that experimental data points compare favorably with model predictions. There is a normal distribution of residuals with high correlation coefficients.

The acceptability of the estimated parameters can be analyzed by examining their independency by a cross-correlation matrix (Table 2). One can see that the cross-correlation coefficients are well below unity, with only a few exceptions. Therefore, the estimated parameters can be considered to be independent and representing the surface process (adsorption–reaction–desorption) of the studied catalysts adequately. From the above results, it is reasonable to conclude that the developed Langmuir–Hinshelwood model suitably represents the kinetics of the ODH of propane using solid phase oxygen of the supported catalysts.

Table 3 shows the estimation kinetic parameters with their 95% confidence intervals. The activation energy can be viewed as the energy barrier required to perform a certain reaction. It is interesting to see that the estimated values of the activation energies for the propane ODH of the present study are consistent with the values reported in the literature. (41, 45) The activation energy for ODH (reaction 1 in Figure 6) to produce propylene over VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 was found to be slightly smaller (120.3 kJ/mol) than the activation energy for the same reaction over VOx/CaO catalyst (126.7 kJ/mol). On the other hand, VOx/CaO requires lower activation energy for COx formation than the activation nergy with VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst. These results are consistent with the experimental data (Table 1 and Figure 5), which show higher propylene selectivity and lower COx selectivity with VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 than those with VOx/CaO. Therefore, the mixed CaO-γAl2O3 supported VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 provides a better influence on the propylene formation reaction as compared to pure CaO supported VOx/CaO. This can be attributed to the moderate level of acidity and moderate metal–support interaction of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst, as observed in TPR analysis. Further, the activation energy for the formation of COx from propane (reaction 2 in Figure 6) is lower than that required for the formation of CO2 from propylene. This suggests that it is easier to form CO2 from propylene than propane. This explains the difficulty to control the selectivity to propylene. On the other hand, the activation energy in reaction 3 of Figure 6 is relatively high, and thus, in this case, the propylene combustion reaction is difficult to occur.

5 Conclusion
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated under gas phase oxygen free conditions in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator using VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts. The mixed CaO-γAl2O3 support poses higher active site–support interactions, as observed in TPR analysis. The increased active site–support interaction controls reaction of the lattice oxygen and favors propylene as a selective product. A competitive and direct step of propane combustion, step of formation of propylene, and step of propylene combustion were considered to construct a series–parallel triangular reaction network for the ODH of propane on both VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 and VOx/CaO catalysts. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism together with catalyst activity decay model represented the kinetics models. The developed kinetic model showed good agreement with the experimental data, with various model parameters displaying satisfactory regression coefficients and parameters spans. VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 displayed lower activation energy for propylene formation as opposed to VOx/CaO. On the other hand, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 requires higher activation energies for undesired CO2 formation via direct oxidation of propane as compared to the activation energies for CO2 formation using VOx/CaO catalyst. As a result, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 displayed superior propylene selectivity.
