New insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on borate-modified nanodiamond†
For the first time, we give a fundamental understanding of the effect of borate-modified nanodiamond on propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. Upon increasing the loading amount of borate on the carbon surface, the propene selectivity shows a volcanic curve. The adsorption sites of borate at different loading amounts are thoroughly considered.
Since it has been found that carbon materials could act as potential alternatives to conventional metal-based catalysts in some important reactions,1,2 carbon catalysis as the newly emerging metal-free catalytic system has attracted much attention in recent years. For the industrially relevant oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), activated carbon, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes as catalysts have been intensively studied for numerous hydrocarbon substrates, including ethylbenzene,3n-butane,2 propane4 and ethane.5 Compared to traditional metal catalysts, nanocarbon materials have significant advantages owing to their unique controllability of physical and chemical properties through structural modification and surface functionalization.6 In addition, carbon material as a metal-free catalyst is free of polyvalent metal sites with complex electronic and spin structures, favoring the investigation of its in-depth mechanism.
Due to undesirable, consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in ODH, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbons are not sufficient to satisfy economic feasibility. Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity. Although this promotion effect has been generally demonstrated in the ODH process of ethane,5 propane7 and n-butane2,8 to obtain higher alkene selectivity, the mechanism is neither completely understood nor is the nature of the interaction between heteroatoms and the carbon surface well defined. For example, is it derived from a physical blockage of catalytic sites or by forming a chemical bond with the carbon surface? Do the heteroatoms have preferential location sites? What is the amount required for the saturated modification of heteroatoms, as well as their corresponding influences on the catalytic activity? These questions are critically important for regulating the catalytic performance of nanocarbons modified with the heteroatoms. Therefore, in this contribution, we used annealed nanodiamond as the model catalyst which was systematically modified with different amounts of borate and probed as a catalyst for ODH of propane. In the ODH reaction, we focused on revealing the nature of the borate modification effect on the catalysis process, providing insights into its interaction with the carbon surface.
Nanodiamond was annealed at 1000 °C (referred to as AND) as the initial sample for borate modification, and the stable curved graphitic layers have been formed on the surface as demonstrated by our previous research.9 Borate-modified samples were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation of AND in (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O aqueous solution.5,7 The loading amount ranged from 1 to 30 wt% (denoted as xB-AND, with x = 1–30). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) reveals that the AND morphology was not affected by the treatment.
The thermal resistance in air for initial AND and different percentages of borate-modified samples is compared in Fig. S2 (ESI†). An increasing resistance to oxidation with increasing boron content can be found, in which the oxidation temperatures were improved by 20–220 °C (T50%) as compared to the unmodified one. This is consistent with the reported work which demonstrated that borate modification could efficiently enhance the thermal stability of carbon materials.10,11 The residue after carbon combustion at 950 °C could be attributed to the residual boron oxide. The chemical state of the borate deposit was characterized by diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†). Upon increasing the borate loading amount, the bands in the region of 3200–3400 cm−1 and 800–1400 cm−1 attributed to the precursor salt became more predominant. The vibrations of oxygen groups present on the initial AND surface, including CO centered at 1728 cm−1 and C–O in the range of 1100–1250 cm−1,12 were gradually shielded and covered by the borate. More importantly, no peak shifts were observed after modification as compared to the precursor, which indicates that borate mainly physically adsorbed onto the surface without forming a chemical bond with AND during the preparation.
ODH of propane was performed to investigate the modification effect on the catalytic activity. The main reaction products were propene, CO and CO2. A small portion of degradation products was also detected. The conversion–selectivity relationship for different catalysts at variable space velocities is given in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The propene selectivity decreased when the conversion increased, which was due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane.13Fig. 1a shows the comparison of the product selectivities at the same propane conversion of 1.8%. With the increase of borate loading up to 15 wt%, the selectivity to propene gradually increased from 47% to 65%; concomitantly, the formation of carbon oxide (COx) was efficiently inhibited. This result verifies that borate modification is an effective way to enhance the alkene selectivity for ODH reaction. However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx. In order to gain further insight into the role of borate in ODH reaction, Fig. 1b gives the propene and COx formation rates, as well as the conversion of propane and oxygen over different samples, which were normalized on the same mass of AND. It can be found that the formation rate of both propene and COx decreased with increasing borate content, suggesting that borate not only adsorbed on the combustion sites that lead to COx formation, but also blocked the catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation. The continuous decrease of propane and oxygen conversion should be related to the blockage of surface oxygenated and defect sites for the activation of reactants. Importantly, the production of COx decreased much more sharply than that of propene at the borate deposition less than 15 wt%, which occurred in parallel with the increase of propene selectivity in Fig. 1a. This demonstrates that borate mainly occupied the combustion sites at the low amount, while an excess of borate (>15 wt%) resulted in the moderate inhibition effect on the reaction rate and reactant conversions. The consequent decrease of propene selectivity at high boron content suggests that the blockage of catalytically active sites was the predominant effect of modification on the reaction. This catalytic behavior is totally different from that of phosphate-modified ANDs in which phosphate was found to solely selectively occupy the combustion sites without affecting the active species in propane ODH reaction.14

It has been well established by previous studies that the borate modification can provide increased selectivity for ODH reaction,10,12 which should originate from the interaction between boron and the carbon surface. The oxygen species on the carbon surface are classified into nucleophilic and electrophilic types. It is demonstrated that the nucleophilic oxygen species, such as ketonic CO, are responsible for high alkene selectivity, whereas highly electrophilic species (superoxide O2−, peroxide O22−) are electron-deficient and can attack the electron-rich CC bonds in alkenes, leading to the rupture of the carbon skeleton and subsequent combustion.2 Therefore, a significant aspect herein that needs our further exploration is to reveal the interaction between boron and the carbon surface, thus providing an insight into this modification effect for ODH reaction.
The existing state of borate on the AND surface during reaction can be confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fig. 2a gives the thermal decomposition curve of the precursor salt, ammonium borate, in an inert atmosphere. By the release of water and ammonia, the precursor borate salt can completely decompose below the reaction temperature (450 °C). There was no significant weight change in TGA above 450 °C, suggesting that the precursor turned into the stable boron oxide (BOx). The inset in Fig. 2a displays the TGA of unmodified and borate-modified samples under the same conditions. The initial AND shows a significant weight loss in the temperature range of 500 to 950 °C, which is attributed to the desorption of C–O groups at low temperature and CO groups at high temperature. However, it can be found that the desorption of these groups was gradually reduced upon increasing the borate loading, indicating that the boron oxide strongly interacted with these sites on the AND surface, thus resulting in the changes in catalytic activity and selectivity.

(b) The temperature for TPO mass loss at 50%, and the increased residual mass at 950 °C in TPO (compared with the initial AND) as a function of borate loading WB2O3.
TPO thermograms before and after reaction for the selected catalysts are compared in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Almost the same oxidation curves before and after catalysis indicated that no loss of boron occurred during the reaction. We further correlated the increased residual mass, and the temperatures for mass loss of 50% with the borate loading amount. As shown in Fig. 2b, a good linear relationship can be found between residual mass and the boron content, suggesting that the loaded borate was in the form of oxides covering the AND surface during reaction. There were negligible structural changes in the catalytic process, which can be confirmed by TEM images (Fig. 3a). Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) images showed that both boron and oxygen were highly dispersed throughout AND after reaction (Fig. 3b), and no boron oxide clusters or agglomerations could be found, suggesting their interaction with the carbon surface. In addition, the oxidation resistance was correspondingly improved upon increasing the loaded borate, but showed a deviation when exceeding 15 wt% (Fig. 2b). This means that the boron oxide, underwent a strong interaction with certain different preferred sites on the AND surface. The surface area of modified samples after reaction determined by N2 physisorption (Table S1, ESI†) had minor changes as compared with that of initial AND until the borate weight loading achieved at 15%. It suggests that the low content of boron oxide could selectively occupy the surface defects, without fully covering the surface, which may account for the corresponding increased propene selectivity. The significant reduced surface area and pore volume at high loading amount can be related to the coverage of active surface and the filling of holes in the graphitic layers.

TGA for all used catalysts is displayed in Fig. 4a. For the initial AND, due to the amount of defective sites present on the surface, these defects can be functionalized by oxygen during reaction.15 An obvious weight loss on initial AND after catalysis is attributed to the desorption of newly formed oxygen groups. However, upon increasing the boron content, the weight loss between 600 and 900 °C corresponding to the desorption of C–O and CO was gradually decreased. Especially, the desorption of the electrophilic oxygen species in the range of 550–700 °C, which are believed to be responsible for the combustion of alkene on the carbon surface and can be formed during reaction,2 was completely suppressed at 15 wt% of borate loading. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that borate predominantly occupied the combustion sites and decreased the generation of the electrophilic oxygen groups on the defects, thus resulting in the increase of propene selectivity when the loading amount was less than 15 wt% (Fig. 1a).

The DRIFT spectra of used catalysts can give the direct evidence about the interaction of boron with the carbon surface (Fig. 4b). In order to exclude the influence of water adsorbed on the catalyst surface, all spectra were obtained after the in situ pre-treatment of samples at 230 °C. It is generally believed that glassy boron oxide is composed of boroxol rings which are characteristic of planar BO3-triangles.16 The interaction with heteroatoms can break these rings, and BO3 and BO4 units are increasingly formed.17 The dominating absorption bands appearing near 1409 and 1260 cm−1 are attributed to the unit of boron triangularly coordinated by three oxygen atoms (BO3).18 Upon increasing the boron content, an additional band at 1078 cm−1 was found, which should be assigned to the vibrational spectra of boron oxide, and was considered as the characteristic peak for the B–O stretching of tetrahedral BO4 units.17,19 This means that the BO3 groups gradually interacted with the additional oxygen on the AND surface and transformed into the tetrahedral coordination. Correspondingly, the intensity of CO vibration at 1750 cm−1 decreased compared to the initial AND due to the inhibition effect of boron modification. This incontrovertibly indicates that the further interaction occurred between BO3 configurations with the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface, thus resulting in decreased catalytic activity at the high loading amount. More importantly, there were new spectral bands with increased intensity centered at 3693 cm−1 and 3350 cm−1 after borate modification. The bands in this range generally occurred due to the vibration of O–H groups. However, in this case, no obvious band for the formation of hydroxyl groups was found on the initial AND surface during reaction, while it appeared with an increased intensity after borate modification. Therefore, it can be deduced that the formation of O–H was due to the interaction of boron with defect sites on AND. They can be linked together by forming the O–H bond and efficiently suppress the generation of electrophilic oxygen species, as demonstrated by TGA analysis in Fig. 4a, which should account for the increased selectivity during reaction. As for the preferentially located defect sites for forming hydrogen bonds, the zigzag edges may be more reasonable, based on the fact that the O–O bond distance (0.240 nm) in the BO3 group is close to the distance between the C atoms on the zigzag edge of graphite (0.246 nm).10
The interaction of boron with the AND surface was further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 4c). The peak at around 192.0 eV for the sample with low boron content is attributed to the structure of boron in-plane linked to oxygen atoms with triangular coordination.20 Upon increasing the borate loading, this peak gradually shifted to the higher banding energy but was far from the formation of boron trioxide (B2O3). It indicates that the electron density around the boron atom in the BO3 unit was gradually weakened, which was usually induced by interacting with another more electronegative atom.21 Therefore, during the interaction with the AND surface, the most likely configuration can be assumed that the triangularly coordinated boron with electron-poor saturated bonds reacted with ketonic CO oxygen groups, a nucleophilic species with high electron density, by forming the tetrahedral BO4 units, the consequence of which was the higher binding energy of boron. In addition, the binding energy of O1s spectra correspondingly shifted to the lower position, further confirming this interaction between boron and oxygen (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is well consistent with the DRIFT results. The coverage of the catalytically active sites by forming the tetrahedrally coordinated boron would result in the decrease of the propene formation rate. Therefore, based on the above analysis, the mechanism of interaction between boron oxide and the AND surface is proposed in Fig. 4d.
In summary, we have studied the nature of the borate modification effect on the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The interaction between boron and the carbon surface was revealed for the first time. Upon increasing the boron content, boron in the form of oxides had a strong interaction with certain different preferred sites on the catalyst surface. At a low loading amount (less than 15 wt%), the boron species mainly interacted with the defects by forming O–H bonds, which could suppress the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thus leading to increased propene selectivity. However, a higher boron content would result in the significant blockage of active carbonyl groups via the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated boron. Therefore, the optimum modification of boron can be precisely controlled. These results give a new insight into the mechanism of interaction between the heteroatom and carbon surface, as well as their influence on the catalytic behavior in ODH reaction, which could provide principles for rational modification of nanocarbons.
