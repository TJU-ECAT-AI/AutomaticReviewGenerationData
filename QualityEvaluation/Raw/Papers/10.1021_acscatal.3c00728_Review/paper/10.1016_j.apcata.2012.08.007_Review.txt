1. Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs) are traditionally used as solvents in various biphasic ILs-transition metal-catalyzed organic reactions with a view to improve catalyst recycling and/or reuse
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in immobilization of ILs, the so-called supported ILs (SILs), using various polymeric
[4]
,
[5]
and inorganic supports
[6]
,
[7]
in order to improve their applicability in industrially important catalytic processes. SILs are generally prepared by coating a thin layer of IL film (SILF) onto and/or into the surface of desired solid support materials. Such SILF-based heterogeneous catalyst systems offer several attractive advantages: (i) concomitant use of ILs, (ii) high catalytic activity owing to a uniform distribution of catalytic active species within SILF and (iii) they can be easily separated from the reaction products for further reusability.
Up until now, various novel concepts of efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalytic systems based on SILs have been developed.
Fig. 1
depicts an outline of those concepts emerging from SILs including supported ionic liquid catalysis/catalysts (SILC/SILCAs), solid catalysts with ILs (SCILs), solid catalysts with IL layers (SCILL), supported IL nanoparticles (SILnPs), supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts (SILPC), ionic liquid crystalline-SILP (ILC-SILP), structured SILP (SSILP), supported ionic liquid-like phases (SILLPs), polymer supported ILs (PSILs) and supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs).

Note that the choice of the support is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of those concepts in any heterogeneous catalytic systems and other potential applications. This is not a comprehensive review but very topical, dealing with some of the SILs concepts that have been developed over the recent years. In our research group, we focus mainly on the synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of layered silicates, porous glasses, zeolites, mesoporous and periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) materials. Therefore, our aim is to present a detailed review on the use of above mentioned inorganic materials as supports for SILs systems.
2. Ultra-thin IL Films and/or supported ionic liquid films (SILFs)
Recently, a number of studies have been focused on the fabrication of ultra-thin IL films on model supports in order to study the surface chemistry of ILs, support-IL interactions and to understand the SILP and SCILL concepts
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
.
Table 1
presents a list of substrates used for the preparation of ultra-thin IL films and their applications. In general, ultra-thin IL films have been prepared by molecular beam deposition and physical vapor deposition (thermal-evaporation and condensation) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). This UHV method, pioneered by Steinrück and co-workers, has been highly useful for the in-situ preparation of well-defined IL films and insightful in revealing the initial stages of growth of IL films. This review does not cover the specific details of IL films and their surface science/chemistry, since reviews are available
[13]
,
[14]
. In addition, several studies have focused on the preparation of IL films on various substrates including silicon-wafer and mica for tribological applications
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
. Ultra-thin IL films are prepared by dip coating or spin coating techniques especially for tribological studies. It is noteworthy that the IL films exhibited excellent friction-reduction, anti-wear performance and high-load bearing capacity. More detailed information on ILs as lubricants can be found in a review by Zhou et al.
[20]
. Apart from all those above mentioned studies, Castillo et al.
[21]
were the first to coin the term SILF that involves the immobilization of Cu-complexes in an IL film on clay (laponite) as a solid support material. In particular, a solvent (dichloromethane) has been used to facilitate complex formation and the dispersion of the SILF (film thickness: 1.8–10.8 Å) on the laponite surface using a slurry and/or suspension method.

3. Supported ionic liquid catalysis/catalysts (SILC/SILCAs)
The concept of SILC was first developed by Mehnert's group in 2002
[22]
,
[23]
. SILC is a pseudo-homogeneous–heterogeneous catalyst, which is prepared by dissolving a homogeneous transition metal catalyst, [Rh(NBD)(PPh3)2][PF6] (NBD: norbornadiene), within a multi-layer of [BMIM][PF6] on silica gel. Indeed, it combines the inherent characteristics of both ILs and the solid support materials. The versatility of SILC is evident from its widespread use as efficient recyclable heterogeneous catalytic system for hydroformylation reactions
[22]
,
[23]
. It may be noted that SILC is very attractive due to its convenient product separation and the ability to carry out the gas–solid catalytic reactions under packed reactor configurations. It should be further emphasized that even a very low solubility of the catalyst in the flowing liquid media will make long term stability of the SILC catalyst system impossible due to slow but steady leaching. Mehnert
[6]
has also reviewed the methods for the preparation of SILC materials and their catalytic performances.
Hagiwara's group
[24]
,
[25]
have prepared Pd-, Cu-, Ru-, and Mac(MacMillan imidazolidinone)-SILC materials using amorphous silica or alumina as supports and studied their catalytic properties for reactions, such as Suzuki-Miyamura, Huisgen [3 + 2] cycloaddition
[26]
, synthesis of macrocyclic ketones
[27]
,
[28]
, olefin metathesis and Diels–Alder cycloaddition
[29]
. Pd- and Cu-SILC have been prepared using surface-modified supports, such as diethylaminopropylated Al2O3
[24]
, nanosilica dendrimer
[25]
and mercaptopropylated amorphous silica gel
[26]
. However, Ru-, and Mac-SILC have been prepared by the same group using unmodified Al2O3
[27]
,
[28]
and/or SiO2 supports
[29]
, i.e. noncovalent immobilization of the IL/catalyst. It is pertinent to mention here that the bulk solvents used in such SILC catalytic applications must be carefully chosen. A solvent that is immiscible with the ILs (SILs) is very essential to this SILC process. If a solvent that is capable of dissolving ILs is used, leaching of immobilized transition metal catalysts/complexes from ILs can occur eventually, and hence reducing their catalytic activity.
The concept of SILCAs, which is analogous to SILC, was developed by Vitranen's group
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
. They have especially used Active Carbon Cloth (ACC Kynol®; surface area: 1500 m2 g−1) as the solid support material for the preparation of SILCAs, which have been successfully tested in hydrogenation reactions under batch as well as continuous three-phase structured reactor configurations.
4. Solid catalysts with ILs (SCILs)
SCILs are prepared by coating free-flowing hydrophobic ILs on catalytically active supports, for example, silica-scandium
[38]
, silica-SO3Na
[39]
and silica-SO3H
[40]
catalysts. Gu et al.
[38]
were the first one to use SCILs (silica-Sc-IL) for carbon–carbon bond forming (Mukaiyama aldol-, Michael- and Mannich-type) reactions. They also demonstrated that SCILs efficiently catalyze the Michael-type reaction of indole with α-β-unsaturated ketones by silica-SO3Na-IL system
[39]
; and various organic transformation reactions, such as Prins cyclization, cycloaddition of epoxide to aldehyde and dehydrative etherification of secondary benzyl alcohols by silica-SO3H-IL system
[40]
.
SCILs have also been mentioned in another context, namely surface confined ionic liquids by Stalcup and co-workers
[41]
,
[42]
,
[43]
. They have prepared various kinds of silica-based SCILs and studied their performance as stationary phases for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) applications.
4.1. Solid catalysts with IL layers (SCILL)
The coating of IL on a commercially available porous Ni-catalyst (NiSAT G33 RS; BET surface area: 105 m2 g−1) led to the development of a novel concept, SCILL, where a thin layer of IL is deposited onto the internal surface of the catalyst
[44]
,
[45]
. This concept has been successfully tested for the sequential hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD) to cylcooctene (COE). Compared to the conventional Ni-catalyst, these SCILL materials offer significant advantages including high yields and selectivity. Claus and co-workers
[46]
,
[47]
have recently extended this concept for the selective hydrogenation of citral to citronellal (100% selectivity) over Pd-based SCILL catalysts under batch as well as trickle-bed reactor
[48]
conditions. More recently, B-Lukasik et al.
[49]
have studied the selectivity enhancement in the hydrogenation of limonene to p-menthene (>99% selectivity) by Ru-based SCILL catalysts under supercritical CO2 conditions.
Both SCILs and SCILL concepts have proven to be effective for improving the selectivity of the desired product in various hydrogenation reactions. Again, it is imperative to mention here that the above mentioned concepts (SCILs and SCILL) are suitable only for reactions that can be carried out under biphasic conditions involving reactants/products and solvents, which are immiscible in ILs. Detailed descriptions and advantages of these concepts, SCILs/SCILL, are given in a recent review by Gu and Li
[50]
.
4.2. Supported IL nanoparticles (SILnPs)
In line with the above mentioned concepts, SILnPs concept has recently been developed for a number of applications. In this case, a catalytically active ionic liquid (IL-HSO4) is covalently immobilized onto nano-sized amorphous silica particles
[51]
. SILnPs (particle size: 290–610 nm) were also found to be efficient catalysts for the dehydration of fructose (conversion: 99%) to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (yield: 63%). This reaction is also of significant industrial interest, since 5-hydroxymethylfurfural has the potential to become an important biofuel. In addition, nano-silica (NSi-OH) and functionalized nano-silica (NSi-NH2) have been used to immobilize 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium-based IL, [C8C1IM][Tf2N] by physical adsorption procedures
[52]
. Both NSi-OH-[C8C1IM][Tf2N] and NSi-NH2-[C8C1IM][Tf2N] reported to be hydrophobic and for that reason very useful for the removal of lead (Pb) from strongly acidic as well as other aqueous solutions (pH 1–7) under solid phase extraction conditions. Most importantly, the immobilization of IL, [EMIM][PF6], onto the surface of silica nanoparticles (diameter: 20 nm; surface area: 620 m2 g−1), led to a significant decrease in melting point (ΔTm = −10 °C) of the immobilized IL in comparison to the bulk IL
[53]
. The melting point reductions were very pronounced for immobilized ILs, such as [PMIM][PF6] (−12 °C; PMIM: 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium), [PHMIM][BF4] (−13 °C; PHMIM: 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium) and [EMIM][I] (−41 °C). This phenomenon has been explained on the basis of the structural change of the immobilized ILs due to the interfacial interactions between the ILs and the support (nano-SiO2).
Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the development of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) supported ILs (MNP-ILs;
Fig. 2
). The use of MNP-ILs for the immobilization of palladium-N-heterocyclic carbene (Pd-NHC) complex was reported by Taher et al.
[54]
. Pd-NHC-MNP-ILs catalyst was found to be very active and recyclable (5-times) for the Suzuki coupling reaction in water. One of the main advantages of this approach is that the catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by an external magnetic field. Zheng et al.
[55]
have used this approach to prepare MNP-ILs catalysts and studied their performance in CO2 cycloaddition reactions. In addition, MNP-ILs has also been used as adsorbents for the preconcentration and separation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from environmental samples
[56]
. Similarly, the use of magnetic silica nanoparticles supported ILs for the immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase has recently been reported
[57]
. It was found that the immobilized enzyme showed good catalytic activity in esterification reaction, 1.18 times higher than that of the free enzyme.

5. Supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts (SILPC)
The concept of SILP/SILPC was pioneered, and the term coined, by Fehrmann and co-workers
[58]
,
[59]
, and its scope has been further extended by Wasserscheid and co-workers
[60]
,
[61]
. There are some striking similarities/differences between SILP and SILC. In both SILP and SILC catalytic systems, an IL film is supported on a highly porous inert substrate (SiO2 or Al2O3) and a homogeneous transition metal catalyst is dissolved into the supported ionic liquid film (SILF). But the similarities end there. The most obvious differences, such as their method of preparation (SILP: physisorbed IL; SILC: covalently linked ILs) and catalytic reactor configurations (SILP: liquid phase and gas phase and SILC: liquid phase), are well known
[50]
. It is pertinent to mention here that SILP is much more efficient in gas phase than in liquid phase catalytic reactions
[58]
due to possible leaching. A significant number of SILP systems have now been prepared and successfully tested for various industrially important gas phase catalytic reactions. The preparation and application of SILP catalytic systems have been reviewed in depth by Wasserscheid and co-workers
[60]
,
[61]
. Most recently, Doorslaer et al.
[62]
reviewed the general aspects of SILP system including preparation methods, various catalyst/IL/support combinations and their catalytic applications. Up until now, SILP system has not been implemented in large-scale industrial catalytic applications. Indeed, SILP technology-based catalytic process is being currently tested and upscaled for continuous gas-phase hydroformylation of an industrial mixed C4-feedstocks
[63]
. Hence, the use of SILP technology in large-scale industrial applications can be expected in the near future. Despite the effectiveness of SILP in the above mentioned application; its inherent issues, such as long-term stability due to slow but steady leaching and recyclability need to be addressed.
Recently, SILP concept has been fruitfully exploited in developing controlled delivery system for ionic liquids-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) using mesoporous SiO2 (pore size: 90 Å) as the support
[64]
. This SILP-delivery system offers significant advantages, including enhanced thermal stability of the APIs and the ability to control and/or fine-tune the release of the adsorbed ionic liquid-based APIs (e.g., tetrabutylphosphonium ibuprofenate and lidocainium ibuprofenate) by the appropriate choice of the counter ion.
Recent developments and concepts related to SILP system include: (i) ionic liquid crystalline (ILC)-SILP is one such novel concept in which ordering and the structural phase-transitions of physisorbed ILC (1,3-didodecylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate; [C12C12IM][BF4]) films on a planar Pt(1 1 1) surface have been observed
[65]
; (ii) another key concept is structured supported ionic liquid phase (SSILP) in which Rh-catalyst supported imidazolium-based IL has been impregnated on a structured catalytic bed (sintered metal fibers, SMFs) that is coated with carbon nanofibers (CNFs)
[66]
. Such SSILP (IL/CNF/SMFs) system is very advantageous especially for studying the fast intrinsic kinetics of hydrogenation reactions, which require efficient mass/heat transfer performances
[67]
; and (iii) supported ionic liquid like phases (SILLPs) with beads and monolithic-type catalysts have also been prepared using polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) resins, which are useful for batch and continuous-flow processes
[68]
,
[69]
.
5.1. Polymer supported ILs (PSIL)
In recent years extensive work has been reported on the preparation polymer supported ILs (PSIL). ILs have been incorporated into various polymeric substrates, such as polystyrene (PS)
[70]
,
[71]
, PS-modified resin
[72]
,
[73]
, PEG-1000-based
[74]
, divinylbenzene (DVB)-cross-linked
[75]
and chitosan
[76]
. Such PSIL systems were proven to be a efficient and recoverable catalysts for a number of catalytic reactions, such as nucleophilic fluorination/substitution
[70]
, N-arylation of imidazole with aryl halides
[71]
, esterifications
[72]
, cylcoaddition of CO2 to epoxides
[73]
,
[75]
, one-pot synthesis of benzopyrans
[74]
and allylic substitution
[76]
, etc. Very recently, Wang et al.
[77]
have prepared Pd-nanoparticles immobilized PSILs by co-polymerization of a functional ionic liquid with styrene that are recyclable and reusable several times without significant loss of activity in Suzuki-type coupling reactions.
There are also reports of PSIL, the so-called supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs)
[78]
,
[79]
,
[80]
,
[81]
,
[82]
,
[83]
,
[84]
,
[85]
. Typical examples of polymer supports include: polyamide (Nylon®)
[78]
, polyethersulfone (PES)
[79]
,
[80]
, polysulfone (HT Tuffryn®)
[81]
, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
[82]
,
[83]
, nafion
[84]
, cross-linked nylon
[85]
and polyimide (Starmem 228)
[86]
and polymer films
[87]
. Such polymer-based SILMs have been studied for a number of gas separations
[79]
,
[80]
,
[81]
,
[82]
,
[83]
,
[84]
,
[85]
, catalytic membrane reactor (CMR)
[86]

[87]
applications. The review articles by Bara et al.
[88]
and Hasib-ur-Rahman et al.
[89]
have given a detailed guide to CO2 separations using SILMs. In particular, SILMs have a much higher efficiency/selectivity especially for CO2/N2 separations than the polymeric membranes. Recent efforts have been directed to the development of SILMs using porous inorganic supports. The following section describes the literature concerning porous inorganic SILMs and their applications.
5.2. Supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs)
There are few publications (
Table 2
) dealing with the fabrication of SILMs using porous inorganic supports (α- and γ-Al2O3) having disc, tubular and hollow fiber geometries. Inorganic SILMs have definite advantages over PSIL for various gas separation applications with high efficiency/selectivity by taking into account of their superior mechanical, thermal and chemical stabilities. In 2005 the use of enzyme (Candida antartica lipase B, CALB) in SILMs for the synthesis of butyl laurate was described by Mori et al.
[90]
. Among the ILs studied, [BMIM][Tf2N] was found to be the most suitable IL to retain CALB and maintain its activity. Further, a combined experimental and theoretical imbibition kinetic study of ILs in porous ceramic-Al2O3 membranes has been reported by Krull et al.
[91]
. This study provides additional information on the membrane parameter (monolayer model) for various IL-ceramic Al2O3 combinations but no information concerning gas separations was reported. Recently, Barghi et al.
[92]
studied permeability and selectivity of CO2/CH4 through porous γ-Al2O3 membranes impregnated with various ILs. It has been observed that higher selectivity for CO2/CH4 separation can be achieved due to higher affinity for the IL and higher permeability/solubility of CO2. In fact, the solubility of CO2 was 30-times higher than that of CH4. Similarly, Iarikov et al.
[93]
have prepared tubular and hollow-fiber α-Al2O3 SILMs that exhibited reasonable CO2/CH4 selectivity (5–30). Very recently, Vangeli et al.
[94]
have reported the grafting of functionalized IL onto the porous Al2O3 support with a view to develop SILMs for CO2/CO separations. The membranes showed significant CO2/CO separation capacity (25) and excellent thermal stability up to 250 °C.

6. Layered materials
Layered clays, such as montmorillonite, kaolinite and laponite, are interesting materials owing to their intercalation and swelling properties
[95]
. Their interlayers (∼1.5 nm) can easily be tuned and expanded by intercalation of various cationic surfactants and catalytic active species. Much work has been done on the intercalation of ILs into the interlayers of kaolinite
[96]
,
[97]
,
[98]
,
[99]
. Unlike montmorillonite (MMT), kaolinite has very low swelling and cation-exchange capacity. Nevertheless, the intercalation of ILs into the interlayers of kaolinite has been accomplished via a melt reaction approach using the dimethylsulfoxide-kaolinite intercalate (DMSO-K) as a precursor
[96]
,
[97]
,
[98]
,
[99]
. This method is especially useful for the preparation of novel, functional organic–inorganic nanohybrid materials. In addition, a significant enhancement in thermal stability (up to 150 °C) has been observed for the IL-intercalated-MMT and PHOS (trihexyl tetradecylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate)-MMT
[100]
, respectively. Very recently, anion exchangeable layered silicate Na-octosilicate has been synthesized via immobilization of ILs containing three specific functional groups (
Fig. 3
) into the interlayer spaces of Na-octosilicate
[101]
that are potentially useful for prodrug (sulfasalazine) delivery systems.

Highly active catalysts supported on clays with the aid of ILs are of considerable interest because of their potential applications in various catalytic reactions, such as hydrogenolysis of glycerol over Ru-Cu/TMGL-Bentonite (TMGL: 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidium lactate)
[102]
, hydrogenation of benzene over Ru/TMG-MMT (TMG: 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidium)
[103]
, isomerization of endo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (THDCPD) over chloroaluminate ILs/Na-MMT
[104]
and enantioselective cyclopropanation of styrene over bis(oxazoline)-Cu/[BMIM][PF6]-laponite
[21]
. In particular, it has been claimed that bis(oxazoline)-Cu/[BMIM][PF6]-laponite system acts as a 2-dimensional nanoreactor in which the thickness of the IL layer can be varied in order to modify the stereochemical results of the reaction due to changes in the energies of the different transition states induced by the steric influence of the support (laponite).
7. Porous glasses
Porous glasses (PG), such as Vycor and CPG (controlled porous glass) are widely used as scaffolds for tissue-engineering, and as supports for membranes, sensor elements and catalysts due to their unique characteristics (flexible geometric forms, chemical inertness and high mechanical and mechanical stability)
[105]
. Recently, PG and Vycor have been employed as supports for the preparation of SILP systems. Haumann et al.

studied the influence of pore diameter on the solubility of 1-butene and propene over two different SILP systems, Rh-[BMIM][n-C8H17OSO3]-silica 100 (pore diameter = 4 nm) and Rh-[BMIM][n-C8H17OSO3]-PG (pore diameter = 30 nm), respectively, in order to unravel the observed high activity/selectivity in 1-butene hydroformylation over the former one. It has been found that the molar solubility of propene (8.4 × 10−5 mol g−1) and 1-butene (19.8 × 10−5 mol g−1) was 5.6 times higher while using silica 100 as the support in comparison to PG (propene: 1.5 × 10−5 mol g−1 and 1-butene: 3.8 × 10−5 mol g−1), indicating capillary condensation for both propene and 1-butene within the smallest pores (4 nm) of the SILP (silica 100) system. Vangeli et al.
[107]
grafted 1-(silylpropyl)-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [SPMIM][PF6], into the pores of Vycor glass and MCM-41, and investigated the corresponding SILP systems for the CO2/CO separation with pressure swing adsorption techniques. Interestingly, the XRD data revealed the crystallization behavior of grafted IL within MCM-41 (pore diameter = 3.3 nm) whereas no such a phenomenon was observed for the IL grafted into the pores of Vycor sample. As discussed in Section
4.2
(SILnPs), confinement of ILs, [BMIM][Tf] and [BMIM][Tf2N] within the pores of CPGs also led to a significant decrease in melting point (ΔTm = −30 °C) of the confined IL in comparison to the bulk IL
[108]
. A maximum decrease in melting point (ΔTm = −11 °C) of the confined ionic liquid ([EMIM][BF4]) in CPGs has recently been observed by NMR cryoporometry
[109]
, which is a unique and effective measurement technique for determining the pore size distributions (2 nm–2 μm) of porous materials.
8. Zeolites
Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials with uniform pore sizes (<2 nm) that find a wide range of applications in many industrially important adsorption, separation and catalytic processes
[110]
. However, the applicability of zeolites as supports for the immobilization of ILs (
Table 3
) is limited due to their small pore sizes. DeCastro et al.
[111]
were the first to use zeolite Beta (Si/Al = 13.8) for the immobilization of chloroaluminate-based ILs. These heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts exhibited high catalytic activities and selectivities in the alkylation of aromatic compounds with dodecene. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in immobilization of ILs within large-pore zeolites (BEA and FAU) and their potential applications as fillers for electrorheological (ER) fluids
[112]
and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)
[113]
. Zhu et al.
[114]
studied the efficiency of IL (choline chloride/urea) supported on FAU-type zeolite catalyst for the chemical fixation of CO2 via cycloaddition of CO2 with various epoxides to cyclic carbonates. This reaction is also of significant environmental interest, since harmful CO2 can be converted into useful chemicals. It has also been reported that palladium(II) acetate, Pd(OAc)2, catalyst immobilized in thin IL layer, 1-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride [TESPMIM][Cl]), on the mesopore wall of hierarchical MFI-type zeolite can act as a highly efficient and recyclable catalytic system for Suzuki coupling reaction in water

9. Mesoporous (MCM) materials
Since the discovery of highly ordered mesoporous materials having large pore diameters (0.2–10 nm) than those of microporous zeolites (<2 nm), the use of such mesoporous materials as supports for the immobilization of ILs has been growing significantly. The types of materials that have frequently been used include MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15, SBA-16 and mesoporous silica, etc. (
Table 4
). This is due to their high surface areas, large pore volumes and the ability to modify/functionalize the inner surfaces by various functional ILs.

To date various mesoporous materials-based SILs catalytic systems have been prepared with a combination of different types of ILs in the presence and/or absence of homogeneous catalysts. It is well known that the degree of IL immobilization on the mesoporous materials has profound influence on their performances as supports for the homogeneous catalysts and their resulting catalytic properties. The most common methods for the preparation of mesoporous materials-based SILs are: incipient wet impregnation
[116]
, grafting
[107]

[117]

[118]

[139]
, etc. Among the various methods available, grafting and/or immobilization is still the standard method, which involves covalent attachment of the functionalized (silylated) ILs on the inner surface of the mesoporous materials. Mesoporous materials-based SILs exhibited better performances in a large number of industrially important catalytic reactions. See
Table 4
for more details. It has been demonstrated by many studies that mesoporous materials-based SILs are indeed attractive in terms of much better efficiency and reusability in comparison to the amorphous-SiO2-IL catalytic systems.
It is noteworthy to highlight the work done by Vangeli et al.
[107]
, who studied the grafting of 1-(silylpropyl)-3-methylimidazolium-hexafluorophosphate, [SPMIM][PF6], on 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTS)-functionalized MCM-41 materials. They were able to study the thermal stability and physical state of the supported IL, [SPMIM[PF6], by various techniques including XRD, DSC and TGA, etc. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of [SPMIM[PF6] at room temperature was observed due to its confinement within the pores. Stefanopoulos et al.
[140]
have recently studied, in detail, the confinement of [BMIM][PF6] in mesoporous silicas (MCM-41 and SBA-15) by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. In the case of MCM-41, this study provides additional information on the preferred orientation of IL molecules in the adsorbed layer.
10. Periodic mesoporous organosilicas with ionic liquid framework (PMOs-IL)
PMOs, which are analogous to the most extensively studied mesoporous (MCM-41 and SBA-15) materials, have gained much attention because of their wide range of potential applications, such as adsorption, separation, chromatography, catalysis and sensors
[141]
. They are a novel class of hybrid organic–inorganic mesoporous materials in which all the organic moieties are either terminally linked to the pore surface or integrated into the framework walls of mesoporous silica. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the synthesis of periodic mesoporous organosilicas with ionic liquid framework (PMOs-IL), utilizing an organosilica precursor having the same structural feature as those of ILs
[142]
. Various combinations of functionalized (silylated) ILs precursors with different types of supramolecular structure-directing agents offer a wide range of possibilities for the synthesis of PMOs-IL with desired functionalities and properties. Currently two methods exist for the preparation of PMOs-IL, including the post-grafting of IL functionalities onto the mesoporous silica walls
[143]
and the one-pot direct synthesis

from a mixture containing functionalized (silylated) ILs and supramolecular structure-directing agents. The latter method is especially desirable for the preparation of PMOs-IL as supports for Au
[145]

[146]

[147]
and Pd

nanoparticles. The porous characteristics and the applications of the PMOs-IL are summarized in

11. Conclusions
As documented in the preceding pages, much progress has been made on the development of various interesting concepts based on SILs. Among the concepts, SILC, SCILs and SILP are some of the most widely studied concepts. More specifically, we have comprehensively summarized the inorganic materials, such as layered materials, porous glasses, zeolites, mesoporous (MCM-41 and SBA-15) and PMOs materials that have been used as supports for the immobilization of ILs, and their applicability as efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalytic systems in organic transformation reactions. Mesoporous (MCM-41 and SBA-15) and PMOs materials having large pore diameters (0.2–10 nm) and high surface areas would certainly revolutionize the industrial catalytic processes involving highly viscous and expensive ILs. Although intense research efforts have focused on modifying the inner surface of mesoporous materials with functionalized ILs in order to improve their efficiency and reuse, considerable effort is still required to address the large-scale processing of such MCM-ILs materials, so that their widespread use in industrially important catalytic processes can be realized. In particular, the synthesis of PMOs-ILs has opened up new possibilities. For instance, PMOs-IL materials offer a novel method for the preparation and stabilization of active Au and Pd nanoparticles. They have shown excellent catalytic performance and reusability in the epoxidation and aerobic oxidation reactions, respectively.
