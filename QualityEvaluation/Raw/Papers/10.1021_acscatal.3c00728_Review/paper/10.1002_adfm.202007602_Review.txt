1 Introduction
With the ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuel energy, serious social and ecological problems, including resource depletion, climate change, and environmental damage, have received global attention.[1] Developing sustainable energy technologies is considered as the promising pathway to resolve the aforementioned problems. Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, including water electrolysis for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide conversion, fuel cells, and metal–air batteries, have been widely studied with the merits of low pollution emission and high conversion efficiency.[2] Oxygen electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is indispensable and determine the cost and efficiency for these technologies. However, the redox kinetics of ORR/OER are so sluggish that highly efficient electrocatalysts are required.[3] Consequently, highly active, long-life, and cost-efficient oxygen electrocatalysts are essential for these electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies.
To date, enormous efforts have been devoted to exploring various advanced oxygen electrocatalysts. However, some existing electrocatalysts are still far from being commercialized due to the limited functionality, reserves, activity, and stability.[4] Generally, noble-metal-based of Pt and Ru/Ir oxide have been known to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performances for ORR and OER, respectively.[5] Nevertheless, their practical applications are hampered due to their limited resources, high cost, and poor durability. Chemical strategies, such as electronic tuning (d-band), physicochemical structure modulation (size, shape, composition, surface, and interface), and the optimization of active sites, have been investigated to increase the intrinsic activity and improve the utilization efficiency for noble-metal catalysts.[6] Cost-effective transition-metal-based (including oxides, carbides, phosphides, and sulfides) composites are regarded as the prospective alternatives to noble ones.[7] However, their unsatisfied activities, especially under the acidic condition, lead to the limited prospects of industrial applications. Researchers have been spending great efforts to solve the challenges between activity and stability. Defect engineering, modulation of electronic structure, and lattice facets have been carried out to increase the active sites and regulate their activity and stability in acidic environment.[8] In addition, carbon materials have been widely used as oxygen electrocatalysts owing to their low cost, high abundance, excellent conductivity, and strong resistance to acidic and alkaline media.[9] Nevertheless, the adsorption/activation of reaction intermediates is not favorable on the inert surface of pristine carbon. Thus, effective strategies, including chemical doping, physical intermolecular charge transfer, and structural defects, have been developed to regulate the electrocatalytic activity of carbon nanomaterials into competitive oxygen electrocatalysts.[10]
In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in oxygen electrocatalysts. We focus on their design strategies of the structure–activity–performance relationship. Following the brief introduction of theoretical and experimental fundamentals on oxygen electrochemistry, recent advances regarding three major categories of oxygen electrocatalysts in noble-metal-based, transition-metal-based, and carbon-based catalysts are successively reviewed for ORR and OER (Scheme 1). Then, the corresponding oxygen electrocatalysis is also discussed in three energy technologies of fuel cells, water electrolyzer, and metal–air batteries respectively. The challenges and outlook for advanced oxygen electrocatalysts toward energy conversion and storage technologies are proposed at the end of this contribution. We hope this comprehensive work will be helpful for research community in future designing highly efficient and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts for sustainable energy technologies.

2.1 Oxygen Reduction
In general, the well-known ORR mechanism with different O2 adsorption modes can be divided into the dissociative or associative pathways. Nevertheless, the higher oxygen dissociation barrier makes ORR likely follow the associative pathway.[11] In principle, a two-electron or four-electron pathway is related to the associative mechanism yielding H2O2 and H2O, respectively. However, the produced H2O2 is very low (<2%),[12] and the four-electron pathway is more attractive to produce higher energy and power density for fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[13] Therefore, we focus on the associative mechanism with four-electron pathway for the ORR illustration under acidic and alkaline environment (Figure 1A). The corresponding elementary steps are demonstrated as follows:

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the free energy of every reaction coordinate in alkaline media is lower than that in acidic media.[14] The binding energy for oxygen adsorption (ΔG(O*)) can be used as a descriptor to predict the ORR activity of electrocatalyst, and the activity volcano plot for different surface reactivity presents that the ΔG(O*) in acid is significantly lower than that in alkaline media (Figure 1B).[15] Thus, developing efficient ORR catalysts in acidic media is much more challenging. Moreover, Pt-based materials usually occupy the peak positions of the volcano plot, while the surface reactivity of Fe/N/C closes the optimum ORR activity, making it a prospective ORR electrocatalyst to substitute Pt-based ones. Based on this volcano plot, producing favorable specific intermediates or lowering the energy barrier for O2 dissociation would be the effective strategy to optimize the ORR activities.
Other descriptors related to the electronic and structural features of ORR catalysts, including eg occupation, bulk thermochemistry, and charge-transfer energy for bulk-property-based descriptors and d-band center, surface distortion, and generalized coordination numbers for surface-property-based descriptors, are exploited to represent the relationship between the reaction intermediates and ORR catalysts.[16] Among them, eg occupation and d-band center are two popular descriptors used to predict the activity of ORR electrocatalysts. In general, eg occupancy at octahedral sites is applied to analyze the catalytic behaviors of transition-metal oxides (spinel, perovskite).[17] The eg orbital and molecular orbital of transition-metal ions and surface oxygen respectively play important roles to optimize ORR performance.[17] The exciting find is the quantitative relationship between the eg occupation and intrinsic ORR activity of perovskite, and the optimal ORR performance can be obtained when the eg occupation is slightly smaller than 1.0 (Figure 1C).[17] The strong orbital selectivity at the Fermi level induced by the formed eg occupation can affect the rate-determining step of ORR between the competitive displacement and regeneration of OH− on the transition-metal ions surface. The adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates can be governed by the localized d-band center, which can be extensively applied to predict the volcano relationship between ORR performance and εd (d-band center relative to the Fermi level) of transition metals or alloys.[18] Typically, Pt with appropriate εd position acts as the most efficient single metallic ORR electrocatalyst, and electrocatalysts with 0.0–0.4 eV weaker metal–oxygen bond strength than that of Pt can present the enhanced ORR performance.[19] Thus, the d-band center can be optimized by alloying, doping, or interfacial engineering to weak the metal–oxygen bindings and approach the volcano peak.[20]
2.2 Oxygen Evolution
Due to the existence of different reactive species under acidic media (H2O) and alkaline media (OH−), the OER reactions in the both media are slightly different from each other (Figure 1D).[13] The corresponding elementary steps are demonstrated as follows:

OER can proceed through two widely accepted mechanisms, including the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism proceeded on a single metal site, and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism proceeded on two neighboring metal sites. Similarly, for the adsorbate evolution mechanism of OER, the catalytic performance can be correlated to one descriptor of ΔG(O*). According to the volcano plot of the electrochemical kinetics for typical oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, and perovskite oxides (Figure 1E), the strong oxygen-binding could induce the formed rate-determining step of HOO* species on the left-hand side, and the formed rate-determining step of deprotonated HO* species on the right-hand side could be induced by the weak oxygen-binding.[21] Therefore, some strategies, including the substitution with foreign elements and the regulation of vacancies and strain, can be adopted to stabilize the HOO* intermediate without affecting the adsorption of HO*, resulting in an excellent OER catalysis.[22]
In addition, other popular bulk property-based descriptors, including eg occupancy and metal–oxygen covalency, are also closely correlated to the OER activity.[17, 23] The eg occupancy governs the bind strength with the oxygen-containing intermediates, and the intrinsic activity presents a volcano-shaped plot as a function of eg occupancy of transition metal oxides (Figure 1F).[24] It is generally considered that the lower eg occupancy can induce the stronger oxygen binding, and the optimal OER activity and high covalency of transition metal–oxygen bonds can be achieved with the eg occupancy value close to unity. To control perovskites followed the OER mechanism of lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism, metal–oxygen covalency descriptor acts as the basis for tuning the electronic structure.[25] Yagi and co-workers explained the higher activity of CaCu3Fe4O12 with similar eg occupancy compared with LaMnO3 by introducing covalency.[26] A higher metal–oxygen covalency corresponded to a larger O 2p character could improve the charge transfer between the active sites and adsorbates in the rate-determining step of OER.[24] Furthermore, the O p-band center closed to the Fermi level could boost the OER activity but decrease the stability of oxides.[27] It is generally considered that the most active oxides are found to be the least stable, which can be related to the unstable surface structure (surface defects, covalency).[28] Therefore, the “scaling-relationship” between OER activity and stability is a conundrum to overcome, especially in the harsh oxidative condition of acidic media.
3 ORR Electrocatalysts
ORR is an important half-reaction applied in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Highly efficient electrocatalysts, such as noble-metal-based catalysts, transition-metal-based catalysts, and carbon-based catalysts, are required to promote its sluggish kinetics and improve the device performance. In this section, various strategies, such as alloying and nanostructure regulation for noble-metal-based catalysts,[29] chemical doping, defect engineering, as well as modulating electronic structure for transition-metal-based catalysts and carbon-based catalysts,[30] will be reviewed for understanding their improved ORR activities.
3.1 Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
At present, noble metals, including Pt, Pd, and Au, are undoubtedly the most highly efficient ORR catalysts. Due to their scarce reserves and high price, increasing the intrinsic activity and improving the utilization ratio are the important issues. As reported, tuning electronic structures (d-band) and morphologies (surface strain, surface composition, and surface facet), and optimizing the reactant adsorption sites (defects and dimensional structure) are regarded as the main strategies to address the aforementioned issues.[29] Thereby, various precious electrocatalysts, especially Pt-based nanomaterials, have been developed for efficient ORR. The mass activity (MA), evaluated by the specific activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), is an important performance parameter and index to optimize the ORR activity and reduce the catalyst cost.[31]
3.1.1 Noble-Metal Materials
For the single-component noble-metal of Pt/Pd, the MA can be improved by regulating the chemical environment and fine structure, such as the exposed catalytic active surface, morphology, particle size, and near-surface strain. An early study indicates that the ORR activities of different Pt(hkl) crystal surfaces are increased in the order of (100) < (111) < (110).[32] Hence, developing different morphologies of noble-metal catalysts (concave/convex polyhedrons, nanowires, nanocages, and other complex architectures) with specific facets exposed is a good strategy, as more unsaturated coordinated sites can be generated to boost the ORR activity.[33] As an example, Pt concave nanocubes with high-index facets of (510), (720), and (830) presented significantly enhanced ORR activities, compared to other morphologies of Pt catalysts (cubes, cuboctahedra) and commercial Pt/C catalysts with low-index facets of (100) and (111).[34] Unfortunately, the MA of Pt concave nanocubes is limited due to their large size (>15 nm). Decreasing the particle size is another good strategy, which can enhance the quantity of accessible surface atoms to improve the ORR activity. Furthermore, strain tuning can optimize the lattice fringe of surface atoms, and a reactivity–strain relationship can provide guidelines to tune ORR activity.[20, 35] For instance, the shape-controlled ultrafine jagged Pt nanowires with high surface strain and uncoordinated rhombus-rich surface configurations exhibited a competitive MA of 13.6 A mgPt−1 (Figure 2A,B).[36] A compressive strain was beneficial to weaken the Pt surface adsorption and thus optimize the ORR activity, but tensile strain had an opposite effect. The deposited Pt nanofilm with both compressively and tensely strained states successfully illustrated the different strain effects on the Pt surface adsorption.[37] These different strain states induced the shift of d-band center of Pt nanofilm, leading to a variation of ORR activity.

3.1.2 Noble-Metal Alloy Materials
Owing to similar properties of noble metals, the construction of different surface structures of Pd@M (M = Pd, Pt, and Au), including nanodendrite and core–shell (cubic, octahedral, icosahedral, hollow, and nanocage), is an effective strategy to optimize the ORR performance.[38] DFT calculations indicate that the weakened ∆EO at the M surfaces accounted for the enhanced ORR activity of Pd@Mn.[39] For example, the constructed Pd@Pt core–shell decahedra presented the boosted ORR activity and durability.[40] Synergistic effects between ligand and strain in the concave crystals with high-index facets contributed to the enhanced activity. Furthermore, the different exposed facets and surface composition of Pd@Pt catalysts have also been widely investigated. For instance, hollow Pt–Pd nanocages with well-defined facets (111 or 100) showed a significantly improved ORR activity over solid Pd@Pt nanocrystals.[41] In the followed work, the effect of Pt atomic layers on the ORR activities of Pd@PtnL core–shell was studied by depositing different numbers of Pt atomic layers on the Pd cores.[42] Specifically, due to the edge substitution of Pd to Pt, Pd@Pt1L octahedra tended to occur a slightly mixed surface composition, which could make the favorable ORR energetics exist on pure Pt shells compared to Pd–Pt shells.[42] Nevertheless, for Pd@Pt core–shell nanocatalysts, the electrochemical selective leaching of their core Pd elements during the accelerated durability test leads to the undesirable structural degradation and poor stability. Based on the adjustable ligament and pore sizes of nanoporous metals, various Pt–Pd–Au alloy catalysts have been developed for efficient and stable ORR.[43] For instance, an unsupported nanoporous catalyst with a Pt–Pd shell on Au was constructed, its initial MA could increase during the first 30 000 cycles and keep stable even after 70 000 cycles.[43] Due to the thermodynamically stable and leaching resistance of Ir during ORR process, another research direction is to create Pd@Pt–Ir for the improved ORR activity and durability.[44] The facet-dependent catalytic properties of Pd@Pt–Ir nanocrystals with boosted ORR activity could be ascribed to the easier protonation of O* and OH* under the coverage of OH* after the incorporation of Ir atoms into Pt lattice (Figure 2C).[45]
Noble metal (Pt/Pd) alloyed with transition metals (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V, Cu, etc.) is another effective strategy to boost its intrinsic activity toward ORR, as it can lower the εd of Pt, modulate the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates on the metal surface, and increase its surface exposure and compressive strain.[46] It is generally accepted that the d-band center can determine the surface adsorption properties of Pt-based alloy, and the ligand/strain effect can be introduced by incorporating other transition metal atoms with Pt.[47] DFT calculations illustrated a volcano-type relationship as a function of d-band center existed for PtM alloys. Among them, Pt3Co, Pt3Ni, and Pt3Fe alloys at the top of volcano plot were supposed to present efficient ORR activity.[20] Similarly, the MA of PtM alloys can be improved by regulating the chemical environment and fine structure, such as the exposed catalytic active surface, morphology, strain tuning, and electronic states, which can weaken the chemisorbed surface oxygen species and make a downshift of d-band.[48] For example, the synergistic interaction between ultralow-loading Pt of strained Pt–Co core–shell nanoparticles and a Pt-group metal-free catalytic substrate together contributed the improved MA of 1.77 A mgPt−1 and durability toward ORR (Figure 2D).[49] Furthermore, bimetallic PtNi catalyst with higher ORR activity attracts wide attention. Compared with the Pt(111) facet, the boosted ORR performance on the Pt3Ni(111) surface is induced by the synergistic effect between the downshifted d-band center (0.34 eV), ligand and morphology, resulting in the improved utilization ratio of Pt and adsorption strength (Figure 2E).[46, 50] As an example, highly crystalline PtNi3 nanoframes with open structure showed sufficient exposure of Pt(111) and the surface strain of Pt atoms, these synergistic effects were beneficial for improving the ORR activity.[51]
Moreover, highly ordered alloy or intermetallics with strong Pt–M interaction and increased Pt–M bonding can tune the local Pt atomic structure, resulting in more advanced intrinsic properties compared with the disordered alloys.[52] Compared to the rich-Pt ordered intermetallic and low-Pt disordered alloy catalysts, this core–shell structured PtCo3 ordered catalyst exhibited a durably compressive Pt surface and high ORR activity. The PtM alloys present remarkable ORR activity, nevertheless, the leaching of reactive transition metal under the realistic condition (corrosive environment in the acid at high potentials/voltages) limits their durability.[52d,53] Alloying Pt with a smaller electronegativity of early transition metal (Y, Gd, Tb, etc.) is efficient to improve the ORR activity and stability by suppressing the lattice atom diffusion, as they can donate electrons and thus reduce the εd of Pt.[19, 54] For instance, various Pt–lanthanide/early transition metal catalysts demonstrated a volcano relationship between the ORR activity and the lattice parameter of these metals (Figure 2F).[47] For another example, ultrathin PtGa alloy nanowires with an unconventional p–d hybridization interaction exhibited a boosted ORR performance and slightly MA loss after the durability test for 30 000 cycles.[55]
3.1.3 Single-Atom-Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with unique electronic structure, unsaturated coordination environments of the active centers, and fully exposed active sites can realize the maximum efficiency of 100%, which exhibits promising potential comparing with their particle form. In particular, Pt-based SAC shows superior ECSA and competitive ORR activity at the lower loadings. However, it is challenging to fabricate SACs and maintain atomic dispersion of metal species with low-cost equipment and high yield.
Recently, different wetness impregnation, coprecipitation, atomic layer deposition, galvanic replacement, photochemical reduction, and spatial confinement strategies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based SAC in the easy operation and possibility of large-scale manufacturing.[56] For example, Pt SAC with 0.4% Pt loading on the N-doped carbon black support was fabricated by wetness impregnation, which showed a high Pt utilization (0.13 gPt kW−1) in fuel cells.[57] DFT calculations indicated the doped pyridinic-N on carbon strongly anchored Pt single atoms for highly active ORR. To prevent the migration and agglomeration of Pt SAC, photochemical solid-phase reduction was adopted to synthesize atomic distributed Pt with 3.8 wt% loading on N-doped porous carbon.[58] The pyridine-type Pt–N4 coordination could stabilize Pt SAC and serve as the active site, thus the optimized chemical and electronic structure of Pt–N4 contributed to the boosted ORR activity. Furthermore, the coordination environment of metal center is an important part of the active site, which plays a decisive role in determining the ORR activity. For instance, the MA of synthesized Pt/MoN (Pt atoms coordinated with N) was 15 times higher compared to Pt/α-MOC SAC (Pt atoms coordinated with Mo) with similar Pt loading (Figure 2G).[59] DFT calculations implied Pt coordinated with N atoms modulated the electronic properties of Pt and induced more positive charge on Pt, leading to a relatively weaker adsorption of OH* and better ORR performance (Figure 2H).
3.2 Transition-Metal-Based Catalysts
Transition-metal-based compounds in the form of oxides/carbides/phosphides/sulfides and single-atom composites are abundant and cost-effective for ORR, which makes them viable alternatives to the precious ones for large-scale application in renewable energy technologies. Nevertheless, their poor intrinsic activities compared to noble-metal-based catalysts, especially their stability under acidic condition, are not satisfied for long-term operation. Recently, various strategies including defect engineering, modulating electronic structure, and integration of conductive supports have been developed to regulate their ORR activity.
3.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides/Carbides
Generally, the ORR activities of transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) oxides are related to the eg occupation and metal–oxygen covalency.[17] For example, the presence of oxygen vacancies of MnO2 improved the oxygen-containing species interaction and decreased the kinetic barrier, resulting in the boosted ORR performance.[60] However, the low electrical conductivity restricts their ORR activity. Vanadium (V) with metallic behavior can be introduced to modulate the electronic structure and conductivity of cobalt oxides.[61] As an example, a spinel oxide (Co2VO4) was reported by combining the V atom chain with electrically active Co cation.[62] Compared to the parent cobalt oxides, the conductivity of Co2VO4 increased with several orders of magnitude. Experimental and simulation analysis implied that the Co(II) cations at the octahedral sites showed a low spin state with one eg electron, which was beneficial for the optimized thermodynamics of ORR. Integrating carbon materials with them is a usual method to enhance conductivity. For instance, N-doped graphene support incorporated Co3O4 exhibited competitive ORR activity in alkaline solution due to synergetic chemical coupling.[63] Similarly, tubular monolayer superlattices of hollow Mn3O4 nanocrystal with the thin carbon coating showed the improved electron transport and enhanced ECSA for the competitive ORR performance.[64] However, these transition oxides only present good ORR activity in alkaline media, the acidic environment will cause serious corrosion at higher working potentials.
Carbides of group IV through VI metals, with Pt-like catalytic features and strong corrosion resistance to acid, have been widely investigated.[65] Recently, metal center and carbon are the proposed active sites in these carbides, therefore, defect engineering of carbon, morphology and strain tuning of carbides are effective strategies to improve their ORR performance. For instance, tungsten carbide encapsulated in high-defective graphitic layers with high density of sub-nanometer porous channels obviously improved the conductivity and optimized the penetration and exchange for different components, which effectively suppressed the agglomeration and coarsening of catalysts during the ORR process (Figure 3A).[66] As a new type carbide, Mxenes with high ECSA, superior electrical conductivity, thermostability, and strong corrosion resistance to acid are the promising potential in electrocatalysis.[67] In this regard, a series of MC2 (TiC2, VC2, NbC2, TaC2, MoC2) were investigated as electrocatalysts for ORR.[68] TaC2 and MoC2 demonstrated superior ORR activity compared to Pt, which could be ascribed to the presence of dual-active-site. More importantly, this optimized active site could break the scaling relationships of traditional single-active-site. Meanwhile, transition metal carbides with two or more metals endow a higher ORR activity than that of a single-metal counterpart because of the existence of synergistic effects and surface strain between each component.[69] As an example, CoFe carbide nanostructures encapsulated within N-doped graphene nanosheets synergistically offered more active sites and improved the interfacial charge transfer, accompanying with the optimized oxygen adsorption energy.[70]

3.2.2 Transition Metal Nitrides/Sulfides/Phosphides
Transition metal nitrides with high electrical conductivity and good corrosion resistance present higher ORR activity and stability than that of transition metal oxides.[71] For instance, the tubular assembly of Ti0.8Co0.2N nanosheets with modified electronic structure by Co doping presented considerable ORR performance.[72] Other nanoparticulate ZrN with strong d-orbital state, similar oxygen adsorption energy of stable Zr-terminated surface and high electron localization at a small Zr–O cluster showed a superior ORR activity and stability, which even surpassed Pt in alkaline environments (Figure 3B).[73] Similarly, integrating carbon materials with nitrides can also boost the ORR performance. For instance, a novel favorable ORR electrocatalyst was synthesized by mounting TiCoNx nanoparticles on the N-doped reduced graphene oxide support.[74] The synergy between TiCoNx and support and the significantly increased active pyridinic-N species accounted for the surpassed ORR activity.
Similar to the oxides and nitrides, metal sulfides also show some promising ORR catalysis. Interfacial engineering, defect engineering, morphology, and electron structure tuning are also good to optimize their intrinsic activities. With the interfacial nanocrystals engineering at atomic level, CuS/NiS2 with well-defined defects and interface demonstrated excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance compared to commercial Pt/C (Figure 3C).[75] As another example, the regulated electron structure of active sites by anion modulation in Co3FeS1.5(OH)6 demonstrated a comparable ORR activity to Pt/C.[76] Furthermore, Co9S8/C nanosheets with rich active sites and nanosheet structure considerably contributed to its excellent ORR catalytic performance and great long-term stability.[77] Incorporating phosphorus with transition metals can also increase the stability and corrosion resistance of transition metals themselves, consequently endows a huge potential for ORR electrocatalysts.[78] However, metal phosphides with inferior electronic conductivity hinder their electrocatalytic activity and electron transfer process. Combining metal phosphides with carbon materials can improve their surface area and electrical conductivity. However, the dissolution and precipitation of cobalt oxides on the surface of Co2P particles during the ORR process participated into their excellent stability in both acidic and alkaline environments (Figure 3D,E).[79] Other chromium phosphide also shows the merits of high thermal stability, good resistivity to oxidation and anticorrosion.[80] Mixed with carbon, the strong oxygen adsorption on the CrP surface facilitated the cleavage of O2 and demonstrated excellent ORR activity and stability in alkaline environment.
3.3 Carbon-Based ORR Catalysts
Carbon-based nanomaterials show the merits of abundant reserves, low cost, superior conductivity, and strong resistance to acid and alkali media, which have been widely used as the ORR catalysts. Nevertheless, the poor adsorption/activation of oxygen and its intermediates exists for pristine carbon.[81] Recently, the regulation strategies, including chemical doping, physical intermolecular charge transfer, and structural defects, have been adopted to develop efficient carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.[30]
3.3.1 Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Materials
Doping heteroatoms (including N, B, S, P, O, F, etc.) into carbon materials is effective to construct metal-free alternatives. Because of the different electronegativity between carbon and heteroatoms, heteroatom doping into carbon nanomaterials can induce the local charge redistribution of neighbor carbon atoms, leading to the changed electron state and thus the improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, the existence of covalent bond between carbon and doped heteroatom accounts for good ORR stability without segregation phenomenon.[30] For instance, the doped N atoms can make partial positive charge shift to the adjacent C atoms, leading to a higher electrical conductivity and surface hydrophilicity.[82] Another example of a sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst showed the promoted O2 adsorption and electron transfer, which contributed to a superior ORR performance under alkaline conditions and slightly lower acidic ORR activity than Pt/C (Figure 4A,B).[83] Usually, carbon electrocatalysts with rich defects present superior ORR activity than doped heteroatoms (including F, N, S, P, B, etc.) into carbon materials.[84] Nevertheless, the real active sites of these N-doped carbon for ORR under acidic environment are controversial. A proof-of-concept study was introduced to evaluate the real active site of pyridinic N dominated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.[85] An edged pentagon of carbon defect could be selectively created by controllable N doping, and the major active sites were proved to be pentagon defects in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, which showed superior ORR activity under acidic environment compared to the pyridinic N sites.

Furthermore, doping of B, P, or S into sp2-carbon can also optimize its ORR activity. For instance, S/N/P/B-doped carbon (carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene) with stable active sites were constructed by a dual doping strategy.[86] This dual-doped carbon demonstrated enhanced ORR catalytic activity and stability owing to the synergistic effect induced by the electronic interaction between different dopants. Another example of the unique hierarchical structure of N, S-codoped graphitic sheets containing stereoscopic holes was constructed (Figure 4C).[87] This unique architecture was beneficial for improving surface area and exposing active sites as well as promoting electron/electrolyte transport properties, resulting in superior ORR activity and stability compared other carbon materials.
3.3.2 Transition Metal-Doped Carbon Materials
Doping transition metal into carbon materials is another widely used strategy to achieve the effective ORR catalysts. Particularly, transition metal and N-codoped carbon in the form of M–N–C receive wide attention. Doping of N into sp2-carbon can serve as electron donor or acceptor when decorated with transition metal, furthermore, highly porous structural carbon with large surface area can enhance the exposure of active sites and mass transfer.[88] Assisted with the templated method, these M–N–C with various porous architectures are developed for electrocatalysis. For instance, mesoporous hollow spindle-like Fe–N–C catalysts were constructed by a novel “reactive hard template” approach.[89] The resultant Fe3C nanoparticles were encapsulated in N-doped graphitic layers by the polymerization on the Fe2O3 nanospindle templates and subsequent calcination. The easily accessible Fe–Nx centers and highly mesoporous structure accounted for the superior ORR activity. A straightforward and scalable molecule-confined pyrolysis strategy was further developed to construct a highly stable single Fe sites (with 3.5 wt% loading) on N-doped carbon nanosheets catalyst.[90] The as-synthesized catalyst presented superior ORR activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic environments compared to the commercial Pt/C. In addition, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used as self-template and pyrolyzed into transition metal-doped carbon materials with controllable porous structural characteristics and variable elemental composition.[91] For instance, a series of Co–Co3O4-based nanoarchitectures were constructed and embedded in hollow N-doped carbon polyhedra with a multilevel architecture optimization (Figure 4D).[92] The optimal yolk@shell catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies, efficient mass transformation, and potential synergies of different components exhibited competitive ORR activity and stability. Nevertheless, these catalysts demonstrate limited ORR performance under acidic environment and the real active site (M–N or M–C) is still unconfirmed. Therefore, in-depth understanding of their active sites and reaction mechanism are helpful to improve the ORR efficiency.
3.3.3 Dopant-Free Carbon Materials
The enhanced ORR activity of doped carbon-based electrocatalysts are usually ascribed to different dopants, while their contribution to the origin of ORR activity and intrinsic carbon defects are far from exploration. Recently, the defect-rich dopant-free carbon with unusual electronic properties has been considered as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in both alkaline and acidic environment.[93] For example, the dopant-free carbon nanocages were adopted to illustrate the effect of intrinsic carbon defects on the ORR activity.[94] The pentagon and zigzag edge are two typical carbon defects accounting in the ORR improvement. Nevertheless, conventional carbon nanomaterials with multiple defect sites hindered the recognition between the performance characteristics and specific carbon defects. In this regard, graphene nanoribbons with relatively single defects and exposed zigzag carbon showed the superior ORR electrocatalytic activity than other carbon atoms (oxidized zigzag/basal plane/armchair edge carbon), and the N-doped counterpart, as well as most reported nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts (Figure 4E,F).[95]
4 OER Electrocatalysts
As the most important half-reaction involved in metal–air battery and hybrid water electrolysis, the OER is also sluggish and its pathway is only the reverse process of ORR. Effective and robust electrocatalysts are also highly desired to accelerate OER process. Great efforts have been dedicated to developing OER electrocatalysts in various noble-metal-based materials,[96] transition-metal-based oxides,[97] hydroxides,[98] oxyhydroxides,[99] chalcogenides,[100] pnictides,[101] phosphides,[102] and nonmetal hybrids.[103] Several strategies have also been devised to fabricate the electrocatalysts with optimized micro/electronic structure from the aspects of surface reconstruction,[104] doping chemistry,[105] coordination tuning,[106] and defect engineering.[107] Herein, some of the recently developed OER electrocatalysts are summarized to discuss the possible structure–activity relationship.
4.1 Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
In general, the noble metals Ru and Ir feature high OER activities in both acidic and alkaline solutions so that the initial studies of OER electrocatalysts are devoted to Ru- and Ir-based materials.[108] However, their performance are greatly influenced by the morphologies, crystal structures, and local electronic structures. To this end, 3D Ir superstructure composed of ultrathin nanosheets exhibited excellent OER activities with an onset overpotential of 200 mV in acidic solution, which was much better than that of small Ir nanoparticles.[109] Moreover, the IrNi alloy-based materials with porous structure and high surface area generally featured excellent OER durability, which was attributed to the leaching effects of less stable Ni species to form the Ir-rich surfaces.[110] Further in-depth investigations revealed the lattice vacancies could be produced with shortened IrO bonds during the Ni leaching, which induced the generation of d-band holes in the IrOx shells (Figure 5A).[111] In this case, the oxygen ligands (active metal oxides) that formed on the surface were regarded as the catalytic active sites.

Among the noble metal oxides, RuO2 features the excellent OER performance.[112] Meanwhile, the OER mechanism on RuO2 surface have been studied by in situ measurements and DFT calculations, in which rutile (100) orientation is the most active and no lattice oxygen exchange occurs on the crystalline RuO2 surfaces during the OER process.[108, 113] However, the major drawback of RuO2 is its poor stability under high anodic potential (>1.4 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). Whereas, RuO2 will transform into the dissolvable RuO4 and its activity is consequently deteriorated (Figure 5B).[114] Generally, IrO2 exhibits a slightly worse activity than RuO2, but it possesses a relatively superior OER stability. Therefore, combining Ru and Ir to form bimetallic oxides have been studied to realize a balance between activity and stability.[115] As expected, the RuIrOx nanonetcages with porous hollow structure exhibited remarkably improved activity relative to the pure RuOx catalyst, which was mainly due to the synergistic effect between Ir and Ru that decreased the energy barrier of the limiting step (O*–HOO*).[116] Also, the OER activity deterioration is significantly mitigated after the Ir doping (Figure 5C).[117] Moreover, following the architecture construction of IrO2 and RuO2, for instance, core–shell structure, the significant enhancement of both activity and stability can be realized.[118]
4.2 Transition-Metal-Based Catalysts
4.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides
Generally, transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for alkaline OER can be classified as monometallic oxides, bimetallic spinel-type oxides, and perovskite oxides. As a typical monometallic oxide, Co3O4 has been widely investigated as a promising non-noble-metal electrocatalyst.[119] In recent years, researchers designed nanoscale Co3O4 from the aspects of engineering nanostructure and electronic structure for improving the OER activity.[120] Engineering the nanostructure could be achieved by optimizing the morphology to increase active sites, while the coordination tuning could realize the local electronic structure optimization. For instance, the ultrathin and porous Co3O4 sheets provided a large surface area and enriched coordinated-unsaturated surface atoms, which could accelerate the charge transfer and OER kinetics.[121] Similarly, mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes were also developed, in which the interconnected architecture endowed the mesoporous Co3O4 excellent mechanical robustness to withstand the impact from the generated O2 bubbles.[122] In addition, the incorporation of oxygen vacancies into Co3O4 structure could further achieve the improvement of electrocatalytic performance.[123] DFT calculations revealed that the oxygen vacancies could create defect states at the bandgap and the electrons could be easily excited, which would bring the improved conductivity of Co3O4 and finally result in the enhanced OER activity.[123]
Compared to monometallic spinel oxides, bimetallic spinel oxides present much better OER performance.[124] The electrocatalytic activity of these oxides can be reasonably optimized in terms of valence states and components. A systematic investigation on ZnCo2O4 and CoAl2O4 was performed to disclose the contribution of Co2+Td and Co3+Oh ions to the OER activity.[125] The electrochemical results showed the performance of CoAl2O4 for OER was superior to that of ZnCo2O4, suggesting that the Co2+Td dominated the OER activity (Figure 6A). Based on the operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results, a reasonable conjecture was proposed that the Co3+Oh was responsible for the double-layer capacitance due to its strong OH− affinity behavior, while the Co2+Td was responsible for OER. Interestingly, the high OER nature of Co2+Td was derived from its low oxidation state, which was favorable for the release of electrons during OER to form the CoOOH acting as the main active sites (Figure 6B). Moreover, the study of the ferrite system revealed that the OER activity followed the trend CoFe2O4 > CuFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > MnFe2O4,[126] implying that the electronic structure and electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic spinel oxides could be optimized by tuning the components.

Perovskite oxides with ABO3 structure also show favorable electrocatalytic activity due to the modulated electronic structure and work function after transition metal substitution (Figure 6C).[112, 127] It has been proposed that the OER performance trend of different perovskite oxides could be theoretically described by the descriptors of free energies of OOH* and OH* species.[128] A novel activity descriptor for perovskites was further developed on the basis of eg electron occupancy principle.[24] In detail, when the eg electron occupancy of surface transition metal ions was close to unity, an optimal OER activity could be obtained (Figure 6D). In this case, the difference of OER activity between BaNiO3 and BaNi0.83O2.5 could be explained based on this descriptor.[129] The Ni vacancy enriched BaNi0.83O2.5 with the eg electron occupancy near unity exhibited a smaller overpotential and higher activity than BaNiO3 with a near zero eg occupancy (Figure 6E,F). Moreover, the free energy difference between OO* and OOH* of BaNi0.83O2.5 was lower than that of BaNiO3, further suggesting that the oxygen adsorption energies could be affected by electrons on both eg and t2g orbitals (Figure 6G).[129] Indeed, too weak (LaMnO3) or too strong (LaCuO3) adsorption energy is not suitable for OER, therefore, a moderate adsorption energy (LaCoO3 and LaNiO3) is beneficial to promote the OER performance.[130]
4.2.2 Transition Metal (Oxy)Hydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a typical 2D material show great potential for electrochemical energy conversion systems.[131] Particularly, Ni or Co-containing LDHs attract extensive attention and exhibit extraordinary OER activity.[132] For example, the Co species in ZnCo-LDH contributed to the superior activity of OER.[133] With further Fe doping into Co(OH)2 to form the CoFe-LDH, the Fe doping could induce the increase of interlayer space of CoFe-LDH, which could serve as the “ion-buffering reservoirs” for electrolyte ions, thus leading to an enhanced mass transfer behavior.[134] In addition, the OER activity of CoMn-LDH could be further enhanced after the anodic conditioning treatment, which is mainly because the Mn ions could leach from the CoMn-LDH structure during treatment and more highly active Co(IV) species were formed in the LDH structure.[135]
To address the problems of the dimensional confinement and increase the active sites of LDHs, the bulk LDHs are usually exfoliated to form few layer nanosheets with increased active sites and optimized conductivity. The typical liquid-phase exfoliation strategy was employed to prepare single-layer LDHs and study their OER activities (Figure 7A).[136] As expected, the few/single-layer LDHs exhibited dramatically enhanced OER performance than the bulk counterparts, which was attributed to the increased active surface area and more exposed edge sites. In addition, the Ar plasma etching method was developed to exfoliate CoFe-LDH, and multiple kinds of vacancies were spontaneously produced in the ultrathin nanosheets.[137] Sequentially, a similar water-plasma-enabled exfoliation method was further developed to prepare ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets (Figure 7B), in which the exfoliated ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets significantly increase the active sites and vacancies (including O, Co, and Fe vacancies). Correspondingly, the coordinate numbers of transition metals were reduced and the surface electronic structure was modulated, thus leading to the improved intrinsic OER activity (Figure 7C).[137] Additionally, the electrochemical exfoliation is an effective strategy to exfoliate 2D materials such as graphite and black phosphorus. Therefore, the electrochemical exfoliation method shows great promise for the exfoliation of LDHs, which has yet not been demonstrated in this material field.

After the deduction of protons from hydroxide materials, the layer-structured metal oxyhydroxides will be generated, which also demonstrate the featured electrocatalytic OER activity. The systematic study demonstrated that the OER activities of transition-metal oxyhydroxides (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) followed the order Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, suggesting that NiOOH featured the superior OER activity, owing to the ideal bonding energy between Ni and OH.[138] However, the OER activity of NiOOH was sensitive to the impurities such as Fe ions, and the overpotential of Ni1−xFexOOH dropped by 200 mV when the Fe content reached 25% (Figure 7D,E).[139] The Fe ions from solution prefer to incorporate into NiOOH at surface/edge/defect sites and significantly affecting the Ni redox behavior.[140] However, two options existed regarding the real active site: one is that the incorporated Fe species possess more higher activity, while the other is that the activity of Ni sites can be enhanced after the substitution of Fe due to the modulated electronic property. The systematical DFT calculations unambiguously revealed the active ability of the surface Ni and Fe sites, demonstrating that the Fe species feature an optimal adsorption energy while Ni sites cannot provide sufficient activity for the reduced OER overpotential observed experimentally.[141] Therefore, in the Ni1−xFexOOH system, the Fe species are the real OER active sites, and the incorporation of Fe species led to a higher OER activity and a lower OER overpotential (Figure 7F). Moreover, the operando Mössbauer spectroscopy suggested the presence of Fe4+ on NiFe oxyhydroxide during OER, indicative of the facile oxidation of Fe3+ in NiOOH lattice.[142] In addition, the OER activity of NiFe oxyhydroxide could be further improved after the decoration of iron sulfide was constructed by microorganism corrosion, which was attributed to the synergistic effect between oxyhydroxides and sulfide species (Figure 7G,H).[143] The doping of Fe in CoOOH system also showed a similar effect in its OER activity improvement.[144] Moreover, Fe dopants could not only facilitate the OER process but also modulate the morphologic and electronic structure of CoOOH. The Fe sites featured much stronger adsorption ability toward HO*, HOO*, and O* species than the Co sites.[145] With the further introduction of Fe and W species into CoOOH, the as-made FeCoW oxyhydroxide featured the ideal energy state and showed excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm−2. The W with a lower oxidation state was expected to be produced during OER, while the Co was more readily oxidized to high valence. The favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure produced by the synergistic interplay of W, Fe, and Co contributed to the enhanced OER activity.[146] Since Fe species are the reactive sites in both CoFeOOH and NiFeOOH systems, the FeOOH would be a promising OER electrocatalyst. Nevertheless, the OER activity of pure FeOOH itself is poor at low overpotential, which can be attributed to its insulative characteristic and low conductivity.[147] Integrating FeOOH with Co or CeO2 to fabricate heterostructures on conductive substrate could overcome these drawbacks to some degree.[148] In addition, the electrochemically driven coordination tuning of FeOOH with unsaturated FeO6 coordination geometry could enhance the conductivity and activate the intrinsic OER activity.[106]
4.2.3 Transition Metal Pnictides and Chalcogenides
In recent years, transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides are emerging as attractive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Amazingly, they also show great promising for OER, which can serve as the bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, these materials are unstable under OER conditions and can be easily oxidized, of which the resulted oxides/hydroxides shell are considered to be the real OER electrocatalytic species.[149] When they were empolyed for OER electrocatalysis, the FeS nanosheets were transformed into amorphous FeOx film with porous structure.[150] Likewise, the deselenization process occurred on NiSe nanorods and the surface was oxidized during OER, thus resulting in the NiSe/NiOx core/shell structure.[151] Recent reports also demonstrated that the surface of Co2P would be oxidized to CoOx during OER reaction.[152] Furthermore, this transformation can entail the bulk structures. The full bulk-structure reconstruction could occurr on the cobalt–iron phosphide to form the highly active amorphorized cobalt–iron oxyhydroxide during OER.[153] The half-operando characterizations confirmed that the phosphorus species were oxidized and leached from the phosphide, further promoting the oxidation of residual cobalt–iron species for in-depth bulk structure reconstruction and amorphorization. Similar phenomena have also been observed on transition metal nitrides, which are mainly due to that the enthalpies of these materials are more positive than those of the oxide.[154] From this standpoint, transition metal chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides almost feature a high probability of transforming into oxides/(oxy)hydroxides during OER process. Nevertheless, these as-derived electrocatalysts generally exhibit superior OER performance than the corresponding oxides/(oxy)hydroxides that are directly prepared, which is mainly due to the high surface roughening and surface area as well as the increased amorphous surface state induced by the structure reconstruction during OER.[149] In this regard, transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides can serve as the precursors or precatalysts to the real active OER electrocatalysts.
4.3 Carbon-Based OER Catalysts
In addition to the metal-based electrocatalysts, nonmetal-based materials as OER electrocatalysts have emerged and developed rapidly. Most of currently available nonmetal OER electrocatalysts are carbon-based materials such as heteroatoms (N, O, P, and S) doped carbons (graphene[155] and CNTs[156]) and carbon-based hybrids (C3N4–CNT,[157] C3N4–graphene,[158] and graphene–CNT[159]). For example, carbon nanotubes with oxidized surface delivered a remarkable OER performance, which was even comparable to the metal-based electrocatalysts.[160] Furthermore, the OER performance of nanocarbons can be optimized by tuning morphologies structure with the increased surface area. Specifically, the unique 3D architecture with large surface area and enriched active sites was developed based on the N, O-codoped graphene and CNTs.[155] The doping of N in CNTs can facilitate the breaking of OH bonds of H2O and the formation of O2. However, the real active sites of the N doping carbon materials is still unclear. Similar to the element of N, P has the same valence electrons as N with a larger atomic size and lower electronegativity. In this case, doping P into carbons can modulate the local charge density and produce the defect-induced active surface for O* adsorption.[161] In addition, the doping of B can also increase the graphitization of CNTs, in which the resistivity can be significantly reduced.[162] The Fermi level of CNTs can shift to valence band after B doping, thus resulting in the enhanced OER activity.[163] Nevertheless, the oxidation or corrosion always occurs on the carbon-based materials at high OER potential, thus leading to the service failure and limited durability. Moreover, metal-free, or not, in the carbon catalyst is doubt for understanding the active sites in the OER, as the imuprities in the materials or test environment would promote the activity. With further developed observation techniques and theoretical analysis, these understandings would be helpful for the design of efficient carbon catalyst for OER.
5 Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts
As the reverse redox of OER and ORR, both reactions are featured with the consistent free energy diagram while different directions. For a given electrocatalyst, it might show apparently fast reaction rate, while the reaction process of the opposite direction might become hard to be realized. Getting favorable bifunctional activities in a single material structure is the main function and target for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, which is highly desired for the rechargeable metal–air battery and regenerated fuel cells.
5.1 Noble-Metal-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
Pt- and Ir-based noble metals are well-known benchmark electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. However, their widely practical application is seriously limited by the high cost. To address this problem, some strategies have been presented including alloying with low cost OER/ORR electrocatalysts and nanostructuring these noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Besides, alloying noble metals with other low-cost metals would be more attractive to stimulate the activity and meanwhile lower the cost. Typically, Ag–Cu alloy electrocatalyst with dendrite structure showed a good bifunctionatlity for both OER and ORR.[164] DFT calculations demonstrated that the oxygen adsorption energy of Ag–Cu alloy clusters was increased compared with pure Ag clusters. In addition, coating the carbon support with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts have been proposed in recent studies. For example, mesoporous carbon nanofiber with uniform RuO2 coating was employed as bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR.[165] However, it is hard to fabricate the atomically coupled interfaces between noble metals and non-noble materials. To this end, the magnetron sputtering technique was used to deposit Pt nanoparticles onto CoO surface.[166] DFT calculation results confirm an apparent electron transfer from CoO to Pt, leading to electron-rich area on Pt and electron-deficient area on CoO. Moreover, the electron donation from CoO to Pt effectively tunes the d-band structure of Pt, which results in downshifting the d-band center of Pt (111) surface. Benefiting from the strong interaction between Pt and CoO, significant electrocatalytic performance and durability enhancement have been demonstrated.
5.2 Transition-Metal-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
5.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides
Transition-metal elements have more than one valence, which can be built into various chemical compounds with different crystal structures.[167] Among them, transition metal oxides in the form of spinel oxides and mixed-metal perovskites are promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Hence, spinel oxides and perovskites are the core topics of this section.
For the spinel oxides, the active site and site activity are determined by their crystal structure, plane, and geometry. For example, Co3O4 with octahedral geometry featured much better activities than the cubic phase.[168] DFT calculations further demonstrated that Co3O4 octahedron featured a much lower O2 desorption activation barrier than cubic one, except much more active sites. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the Co3O4 enclosed by (112) facets exhibited higher bifunctional performance than that of (001) and (111) facets.[169] Bimetallic Co–Mn spinel oxides are another promising candidate as bifunctional electrocatalysts among all the transition metal oxides.[170] The spinel structure could be tuned by varying the Co/Mn ratio, in which the crystallographic structure showed cubic spinel phase at low Mn proportions, while the tetragonal spinel structure was presented at high Mn proportions (Figure 8A). The tetragonal spinel c-CoMn2 featured much higher OER and ORR activities and better stabilities, which were attributed to the abundant ionic defects, smaller particle sizes, and higher active surface area. Besides, CoxMn3−xO4 spinel oxides with controllable crystallographic phase showed two spinel oxides of CoMnO–P and CoMnO–B with cubic and tetragonal spinel phases (Figure 8B).[124] The cubic spinel phase exhibited better ORR activity than the tetragonal spinel phase, while the OER performance followed a different trend. In detail, the Co defect site featured stronger oxygen adsorption ability than manganese defect site, and the cubic (113) surface could generate more stable oxygen adducts than tetragonal (121) surface. Therefore, the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities (OER and ORR) of tetragonal and cubic CoMnO spinel phase were attributed to the disparate oxygen adsorption binding energies of Co and the defect sites of Mn. Additionally, the eg filling of octahedral-coordinated Mn could also be employed to describe the OER/ORR activities. When the eg < 1, the OH− is hard to be regenerated for ORR. Similarly, the lower eg filling limits the M–OO2− formation, while the higher eg filling hinders the M–OOH− regeneration (Figure 8C). The moderate eg filling (close to unity) leads to the optimized OER/ORR activities. To realize the eg unity filling, the Mn should be in the 3-valent state (Figure 8D). Hence, creating oxygen vacancy to improve the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+ can continuously increase the ORR/OER performance. This hypothesis can be extended to apply for other spinels including XFe2O4 (X = Co, Ni, and Mn), XCo2O4 (X = Co, Ni, and Zn), and LixMn2O4 (Figure 8E).[171]

As discussed in the previous section, perovskite oxides (ABO3) feature good OER performance, while their ORR activity is relatively poor. The conductivity and electrocatalytic activity could be enhanced by substituting of A and B sites with other cations. For example, the ORR activity was greatly improved by optimizing Mn cations at the B sites in mesoporous LaMnO3 perovskite.[172] Several simulation studies suggested that the cations doping could modulate the electronic structure of perovskites and further result in the enhanced electrocatalytic activity.[127, 173] In addition, a wide range of cations can act as the dopants to modulate the structure of perovskites. Ca(II) or Co(II) ion-doped LaMnO3 exhibited an enhanced ORR activity, which was mainly due to the presence of oxygen vacancies facilitate the diffusion of O2 within the structure.[174] Moreover, the partial substitution of La(II) by Ca(II) in La1−xCaxCoO3 (0.2 < x < 0.4) electrocatalysts could also lead to an increased active area and bifunctional performance.[175] The above examples show that the modulated electronic structure and defect properties of transition metals oxides can make them exhibit bifunctional activities for OER and ORR. In addition, the eg filling hypothesis also plays an important role in governing the OER/ORR activities for perovskite oxides. With eg filling close to unity, perovskites were found to show the optimal electrocatalytic performance.[24, 127] However, the values of eg filling are usually estimated by ex situ bulk-sensitive measurements, which is hard to obtain the accurate value.[176] Hence, the advanced surface-sensitive techniques are highly desired for accurately measuring the eg filling of catalysts during electrocatalysis.
5.2.2 Transition Metal Hydroxides
Transition-metal-based LDH materials have demonstrated excellent OER activity. However, the weak ORR activity of most LDHs greatly limits their application as bifunctional electrocatalysts. Fortunately, some of the Ni-based LDHs such as NiFe,[177] NiCo,[178] NiMn,[179] and NiRu-LDHs[180] show promising ORR activity. With further introduction of oxygen defects, the ternary O–NiCoFe-LDH catalyst exhibited outstanding bifunctional performance compared with the pristine NiCoFe-LDH.[181] Indeed, the intrinsically poor conductivity and small surface area can be addressed by coupling the conductive supports. For example, a hybrid of NiCoFe-LDH onto N-doped graphene oxide displayed remarkable bifunctional performance due to the synergistic effect between LDH and N-doped.[182] In addition, Ag nanoparticles decorated NiRu-LDH nanosheets would interestingly induce the formation of multivacancy sites, together with the synergistic effect between NiRu-LDH and Ag nanoparticles, the formation of Ag/NiRu LDH heterojuction accounted for the superb bifunctional electrocatalytic performance.[183] Although some of the Ni-based LDHs mentioned above have demonstrated bifunctional activity, limited research works on the quantification of site populations are reported. Therefore, theoretical studies are particularly needed in the future to examine the reaction mechanisms and active sites on the LDH-based materials to establish more rigorous structure–activity relationships.
5.2.3 Transition Metal Chalcogenides
In recent years, the Ni- and Co-based sulfides exhibit promising OER and ORR activities due to their electrochemically stable nature. For example, Co9S8 anchored onto the N, S-codoped carbon tubes, exhibited enhanced bifunctional ORR and ORR performance.[184] Further DFT calculations revealed that the intimate contact between Co9S8 nanoparticles and porous carbon tubes brought cooperative effects, favorable to promote the bifunctional activity. Similarly, the electrocatalytic activity of homogeneous bimetallic NiCo2S4 grown on N-doped carbon nanotubes could be tuned by tailoring the crystal size of NiCo2S4 and the resulting electrocatalyst featured higher bifunctional activity and excellent battery performance.[185] Another hybrid of CuS/NiS2 electrocatalysts would bring abundant defects and nanointerfaces, these atomic level-coupled interfaces between CuS and NiS2 could provide numerous active sites for effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.[186]
5.3 Carbon-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
Carbon-based materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high bifunctional activity and good stability for ORR and OER. The electrocatalytic performance of carbon-based materials could be optimized by geometry modulation, heteroatom doping, and surface functionality.[187] Doping the heteroatoms (N, S, P, or B) into carbon structure could modulate the electronic structure and surface electronic states to increase their bifunctional activities.[188] For example, the N-doped graphene exhibited excellent bifunctional OER/ORR activity and stability, of which the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N moieties were responsible for OER, whereas the electron-donating quaternary N sites were responsible for ORR.[189] Further, the N, S-codoped carbon nanosheets exhibited excellent OER and ORR bifunctional performance, which was even better than that of the metal-based electrocatalysts (Figure 9A,B).[190] With the construction of porous structure, the N, B dual-doped highly porous carbon also exhibited a high bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both OER and ORR.[191] Moreover, N, P-codoped carbon foam with large surface area of 1663 m2 g−1 demonstrated a high bifunction performance for oxygen electrocatalysis (Figure 9C,D). DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatoms (N and P) and edge effects played critical role for the bifunctional activities.[188] In detail, the adsorption of chemical species and electrocatalytic activities were determined by the distance of doping sites from the carbon edge. The N–P sites are responsible for OER, while the N-doped sites are responsible for ORR. Revealing the OER and ORR mechanisms on heteroatom-doped carbon materials is essential to finely optimize the bifunctional performance. Recently, the relationship between the intrinsic activity and heteroatoms in carbon materials would afford some guidelines for the fabrication of heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts with high OER and ORR bifunctional activities (Figure 9E–G).[192] Various material structures such as heteroatom single-doped/codoped graphene have been calculated to establish a descriptor. Based on these results, key descriptors were identified for both ORR and OER on the carbon materials, in which the free energy difference between OH* and OOH* exhibited linear relationship. Note that the edge sites of the graphitic structure but different sites feature the minimum overpotentials for ORR and OER.

6 Electrochemical Energy Technologies
The increasing energy demands and sustainable environment call the advanced electrochemical energy technologies for sustainable development of human society. Fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and rechargeable metal–air batteries have been widely studied with the merits of low pollution emissions and high energy density. Oxygen electrocatalysts act as the key component in these energy technologies. To meet the requirements for their commercial application, low-cost, high-efficiency, and robust oxygen electrocatalysts are indispensable.
6.1 Fuel Cells
Fuel cells with high energy density and low pollution emissions are regarded as promising clean energy for vehicles and power systems to meet future energy challenges. Their commercializations are still limited to the precious noble metal electrocatalysts, such as the high loading and thermodynamically unstable of Pt during the fuel cells operation. In this respect, alloying Pt with 3d transition metals can improve the activity and stability of Pt catalysts by the synergetic effect of induced strain and ligand, accompanied with overcoming the cost by reducing the Pt usage. For instance, PtCo nanoparticles over Co–Nx–Cy substrate was constructed with ultralow Pt loading of 0.043 mgPt cm−2 in fuel cells.[49] The synthesized catalyst demonstrated a high MA (1.77 A mgPt−1) and retained 64% of its initial MA after 30 000 cycles of durability test. Our group reported that the synthesis of bunched Pt–Ni alloy nanocages attained a superior power density of 0.92 W cm−2 and remained stable service over 180 h in H2–air fuel cell, which could be ascribed to highly strain Pt-rich surface and modified coordination environment with a weakened Pt–O binding strength after the appropriate incorporation of Ni (Figure 10A–C).[193] However, the leaching of transition metal occurred in acidic medium adversely affects the fuel cell durability. Therefore, to control the transition metal leaching and stabilize it in PtM alloy under acidic conditions, the hard-magnet L10-CoPt/Pt core-shell nanoparticles with the ligand effect of Co and the biaxial strain of Pt shell induced the lower binding of oxygenated species and contributed to boost ORR performance in fuel cells (Figure 10D,E).[194] Its initial MA (0.56 A mgPt−1) reduced by only 19% (0.45 A mgPt−1) after the durability test for 30 000 cycles, which surpassed the 2020 targets on Pt activity (0.44 A mgPt−1) and durability (<40% loss in the initial MA after 30 000 cycles) set by US Department of Energy (Figure 10F).

SACs with high ORR performance in fuel cell have attracted widely attention. Usually, the synergetic effect of N-coordinated local structure of Fe–N–C catalysts can induce lower adsorption energies for the oxygenated intermediates. For instance, a concave Fe–N–C SAC was reported with enhanced external surface area and mesoporosity, it demonstrated superior power density (1.18 W cm−2) and activity (0.047 A cm−2 at 0.8 ViR-free) in H2–O2 cell (Figure 10G,H).[195] Furthermore, atomic Fe-doped MOF-derived carbon polyhedrons with low loading of 1 mg cm−2 exhibited excellent power density (0.463 W cm−2) and good durability (32.2% voltage loss after 10 h) in a H2–O2 fuel cell.[196] Nevertheless, the Fe and peroxide are conducive to a free radicals generation that considerably degrades the organic ionomer and the membrane in the electrodes.[197] Therefore, ORR catalysts without Pt and Fe are urgently needed for inexpensive and durable fuel cell.[198] In this regard, nitrogen-coordinated atomically dispersed Co could inhibit the inactive metallic aggregation and expose highly dispersed CoN4 site into porous carbon, which significantly improved the catalyst durability in acidic media and thus enhanced the performance of fuel cell.[197] Due to the low active site density, the metal loadings of SACs need to be improved while maintaining the resolved and isolated active sites for their large-scale applications, thus there is a long way to realize their actual performance and stability.
6.2 Water Electrolyzer
Water electrolyzer is another conversion technology to transform solar energy into high-purity hydrogen. The electrolyzer consists of two main reactions including HER and OER (Figure 11A), and efficient electrocatalysts are indispensable to promote their sluggish kinetics.[199] For the overall water splitting, many noble-metal-free electrocatalysts have shown higher activity than the Pt/C–Ir/C couple in alkaline or neutral media. Recently, morphology, strain tuning, and interface engineering are effective strategies to design electrocatalysts with excellent activity. Among them, the 2D nanosheets with amorphous structure can induce the d-band center and binding strengths between the reaction intermediate reduce.[200] A novel amorphous FePO4 nanosheets grown on Ni foam presented superior catalytic performance,[201] and its assembled electrolyzer afforded the voltages of 1.54 V (10 mA cm−2) and 1.72 V (100 mA cm−2) in 1.0 m KOH (Figure 11B), accompanied with superior mechanical robustness and stability. A further example, ultrathin and amorphous NiFe oxyhydroxide with superior intrinsical activity, high surface areas, and reduced charge transfer resistance demonstrated excellent OER stability over 120 h at the high current densities of 1000 mA cm−2.[202] More importantly, the assembled electrolyzer (Ni nanowires as HER electrode) presented a low voltage of 1.76 V at the current density of 1000 mA cm−2 under alkaline media. The exciting find was the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of CoMoSx chalcogel with abundant active sites/defects and the unique micro/nanostructure demonstrated excellent activity and stability toward overall water splitting (Figure 11C–E).[203] This synthesized catalyst needed low voltage (1.89 V) at 0.5 A cm−2 current density and maintained its activity for 100 h.

However, bifunctional electrocatalysts are gradually oxidized and usually dissolved into the acidic electrolyte. Based on synergistic effects occurring between HER and OER electrocatalysts, MoSe2 flakes with ball-like shaped Mo2C crystals supported by single-walled carbon nanotube were hybridized to improve the water-splitting performance in pH universal media.[204] The constructed tonanosized hollow RuIrOx nanonetcages by introduction of Ir induce the decreased energy barriers for both HER and OER, and the prevention of Ru from overoxidation under acidic OER environment (Figure 11F).[205] This nanonetcage catalyst presented superior activity and good stability toward overall water splitting at a broad pH range (Figure 11G).
6.3 Metal–Air Batteries
Metal–air batteries as important energy storage devices possess extremely high theoretical energy densities.[206] Among all metal–air batteries, Zn–air battery demonstrates the promising potential due to the abundant zinc source and high safety with comparable energy density.[207] Zn–air battery generates and stores electricity through the redox reaction of anodic Zn and cathodic oxygen. However, its commercialization on a large-scale application is locked by the sluggish ORR during discharging and OER during charging process.[208] Therefore, to advance toward the development of commercial of Zn–air battery, efficient and robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are indispensable and strongly desired.
In recent years, graphitic layers encapsulated transition-metal-based materials have reported for Zn–air battery.[209] The full encapsulated transition-metal nanoparticles with ultrafine and high metal-loading exhibited superb OER and ORR activities and stabilities (Figure 12A–C).[210] Using this material as air electrode, an unprecedented cycle stability was achieved for the rechargeable Zn–air battery. In addition, MOFs derived carbon encapsulated metal structures also feature excellent bifunctional activities and show great promising for Zn–air battery.[211] For example, MOFs derived N-doped carbon nanotube in the hollow frameworks form exhibited higher OER and ORR activities and stabilities than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, which were mainly attributed to the unique chemical compositions and robust architecture.[212] With the introduction graphene, the surface area of the N-doped carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrid was significantly increased, thus leading to the enriched active sites and superior Zn–air battery performance (Figure 12D–F).[213] Indeed, the large surface area and enriched accessible active sites are key factors for the electrocatalysts to deliver good battery performance, which can be addressed by creating porous structure. For example, using silica as template, the interconnected macroporous carbon matrix was developed with interconnected porous structure and enriched accessible Co–N–C active sites (Figure 12G,H), which delivered excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR (Figure 12I) and OER (Figure 12J).[214] The oxygen electrocatalytic activity and Zn–air battery performance could be further enhanced by constructing continuous nanocarbon network, in which the electrocatalyst with interconnected N-doped carbon nanotubes possessed abundant Co–N/C sites and robust architecture (Figure 12K–N).[215] The Co–N/C sites facilitated the adsorption of oxygen reaction intermediates, while the open and porous architecture ensured the efficient access and release of oxygen molecules. Benefiting from these features, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance in Zn–air battery (Figure 12O,P) and remarkable stability with a negligible voltage fading during the 1600 h of charge/discharge process (4800 cycles; Figure 12Q).

7 Perspective and Outlook
Exploring high efficient and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts is always significant for several energy conversion and storage technologies. Numerous strategies have been adopted to construct advanced oxygen electrocatalysts. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the fundamental aspects of oxygen electrochemistry, the structure–activity–performance relationship of oxygen electrocatalyst are discussed in the rational design approaches of the three types of catalysts including noble metal, transition metal, and carbon materials. Subsequently, oxygen electrocatalysts in related energy conversion and storage technologies are discussed in fuel cells, water electrolyzer, and metal–air batteries (Scheme 2). Numerous achievements have been realized on the efficient electrocatalyst for several electrochemical energy technologies, but more innovations are still required to meet the increasing energy demand and environment pressure. Particularly, some perspectives are proposed below for future development of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts toward energy conversion and storage technologies.

Perspectives related to oxygen electrocatalysts for their potential energy technologies.
The first is always developing novel efficient and robust oxygen electrocatalysts, sometimes with special functionality like pH universal, as it is the key to realize the efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. The significant lower oxygen adsorption binding energy in acidic than that in alkaline media illustrates that developing efficient ORR catalysts in acidic media is much more challenging. In addition, most transition-metal-based catalysts show competitive activity compared to noble-metal-based counterpart, nevertheless, they often suffer the serious dissolution in acidic environment. Therefore, developing efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysts are imperative for their practical applications. Exploring stable potential windows for OER/ORR electrocatalysts can be adopted to keep the electrocatalytic activity and simultaneously suppress deactivation pathways. In addition, the incorporation of heteroatoms or introduction of an appropriate carbon support material are useful strategies to stabilize the reaction termination in acidic media, which can apply the surface engineering to develop high active and stable transition-metal-based catalysts operated in acidic media.
The second insight would be improving the intrinsic activity beyond the scaling relation. Many non-noble-metal-based catalysts present more competitive catalytic activity than noble ones. Nevertheless, the inherent scaling relation of oxygen-containing intermediates still require them to have a minimum theoretical overpotential (0.3–0.4 V). Therefore, breaking the adsorption-energy scaling relations is an effective strategy to design superior ORR/OER catalysts. Some strategies including substitution with foreign elements and regulation of the vacancies and strain can be adopted to stabilize the reaction intermediate and optimize the adsorption energies of various intermediates. Furthermore, DFT calculation can be powerful to obtain the adsorption information. With the assistance of theoretical calculations and popular big data, understanding and beyond the scaling relation would be more hopeful.
Except the electrocatalysts, the third one would be developing practical synthetic and performance evaluation methods. In general, innovative synthetic pathways can create well-designed structures (such as hierarchical porous and ultrathin nanosheets) and expose more catalytically active sites (such as oxygen vacancy, edge sites, and intrinsic defects), which are significant for the boosted electrocatalytic activity with optimized adsorption properties. Therefore, high-precision synthetic methods should be developed to produce effective oxygen electrocatalysts with homogeneous and easily detected active sites. Meanwhile, these synthetic approaches of oxygen electrocatalysts, with environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and scale-up, should also be considered for the commercial application in sustainable energy conversion devices. Furthermore, the effective performance evaluation methods of oxygen electrocatalysts are essential for their practical application. It is generally known fuel cells consists the important component of membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is an effective performance evaluation indicator for practical fuel cell. Nevertheless, numerous works have devoted to evaluate the ORR activity at the rotating disk electrode level, and few results reported the ORR electrocatalysts on the MEA tests. In addition, the cost and durability especially in acidic media of ORR electrocatalysts are key issues for the commercial of fuel cell. Therefore, the superior ORR electrocatalysts with low cost and high durability at the MEA level are vital for the application of fuel cell in the marketplace. In the case of metal–air batteries, developing anode to match the advanced oxygen electrode is also of great importance for the stable operation in the full life cycle of whole battery system. For the industrial standard of water electrolyzer, developing bifunctional HER and OER catalysts is vital to the practical application of water-splitting electrolyzer, which can lower the manufacturing costs and simplify the overall water-splitting electrolyzer design. Furthermore, unstable and kinetically sluggish OER when the current density exceeds 0.5 A cm−2 are crucial issues limit the practical large-scale application of water-splitting electrolyzer. Therefore, developing water-splitting electrocatalysts with superior activity, good stability, and low cost at large current densities are essential for the commercial water electrolyzer. The rigorous requirement of electron and mass transfer efficiency can be improved by rationally designing the morphology and architecture of the whole catalytic electrode, which can optimize the reaction kinetics and keep mechanical stability.
The forth one would be developing advanced techniques for operando observations. Since the important descriptor of eg occupancy is closely correlated to the ORR/OER activity, the estimated methods are usually adopted by ex situ measurements or DFT calculations. Developing advanced operando techniques is vital to accurately measure the eg occupancy of ORR/OER electrocatalysts. In addition, the surface structure of oxygen electrocatalysts seems to change under oxygen catalytic process. However, the competition reaction mechanisms on the surface of metal and oxygen are not clear. Furthermore, the changed structure related to phase transformations, valence state, and morphological variations of oxygen electrocatalysts cannot be captured under OER/ORR conditions. In these regards, advanced characterization techniques including near-atmospheric X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, and near-atmospheric scanning tunneling microscopy can be introduced to capture the catalyst evolution and reaction intermediates for better understanding the catalytic reaction mechanism during the process. Particularly, these operando techniques are also required at the device level as the oxygen electrochemical reactions happening in the energy technologies are more complicated due to more requirements in electrolyte, reagents, voltages, and catalysts themselves. Finally, advanced oxygen electrocatalysts determine their efficiency and cost for the energy storage and conversion technologies. With continuous innovations and deep understandings in the oxygen electrocatalysis, these sustainable energy technologies can power human society more close to a bright future.

1 Introduction
With the ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuel energy, serious social and ecological problems, including resource depletion, climate change, and environmental damage, have received global attention.[1] Developing sustainable energy technologies is considered as the promising pathway to resolve the aforementioned problems. Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, including water electrolysis for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide conversion, fuel cells, and metal–air batteries, have been widely studied with the merits of low pollution emission and high conversion efficiency.[2] Oxygen electrochemical reactions such as oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is indispensable and determine the cost and efficiency for these technologies. However, the redox kinetics of ORR/OER are so sluggish that highly efficient electrocatalysts are required.[3] Consequently, highly active, long-life, and cost-efficient oxygen electrocatalysts are essential for these electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies.
To date, enormous efforts have been devoted to exploring various advanced oxygen electrocatalysts. However, some existing electrocatalysts are still far from being commercialized due to the limited functionality, reserves, activity, and stability.[4] Generally, noble-metal-based of Pt and Ru/Ir oxide have been known to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performances for ORR and OER, respectively.[5] Nevertheless, their practical applications are hampered due to their limited resources, high cost, and poor durability. Chemical strategies, such as electronic tuning (d-band), physicochemical structure modulation (size, shape, composition, surface, and interface), and the optimization of active sites, have been investigated to increase the intrinsic activity and improve the utilization efficiency for noble-metal catalysts.[6] Cost-effective transition-metal-based (including oxides, carbides, phosphides, and sulfides) composites are regarded as the prospective alternatives to noble ones.[7] However, their unsatisfied activities, especially under the acidic condition, lead to the limited prospects of industrial applications. Researchers have been spending great efforts to solve the challenges between activity and stability. Defect engineering, modulation of electronic structure, and lattice facets have been carried out to increase the active sites and regulate their activity and stability in acidic environment.[8] In addition, carbon materials have been widely used as oxygen electrocatalysts owing to their low cost, high abundance, excellent conductivity, and strong resistance to acidic and alkaline media.[9] Nevertheless, the adsorption/activation of reaction intermediates is not favorable on the inert surface of pristine carbon. Thus, effective strategies, including chemical doping, physical intermolecular charge transfer, and structural defects, have been developed to regulate the electrocatalytic activity of carbon nanomaterials into competitive oxygen electrocatalysts.[10]
In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in oxygen electrocatalysts. We focus on their design strategies of the structure–activity–performance relationship. Following the brief introduction of theoretical and experimental fundamentals on oxygen electrochemistry, recent advances regarding three major categories of oxygen electrocatalysts in noble-metal-based, transition-metal-based, and carbon-based catalysts are successively reviewed for ORR and OER (Scheme 1). Then, the corresponding oxygen electrocatalysis is also discussed in three energy technologies of fuel cells, water electrolyzer, and metal–air batteries respectively. The challenges and outlook for advanced oxygen electrocatalysts toward energy conversion and storage technologies are proposed at the end of this contribution. We hope this comprehensive work will be helpful for research community in future designing highly efficient and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts for sustainable energy technologies.

2 Oxygen Electrocatalysis
2.1 Oxygen Reduction
In general, the well-known ORR mechanism with different O2 adsorption modes can be divided into the dissociative or associative pathways. Nevertheless, the higher oxygen dissociation barrier makes ORR likely follow the associative pathway.[11] In principle, a two-electron or four-electron pathway is related to the associative mechanism yielding H2O2 and H2O, respectively. However, the produced H2O2 is very low (<2%),[12] and the four-electron pathway is more attractive to produce higher energy and power density for fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[13] Therefore, we focus on the associative mechanism with four-electron pathway for the ORR illustration under acidic and alkaline environment (Figure 1A). The corresponding elementary steps are demonstrated as follows:

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the free energy of every reaction coordinate in alkaline media is lower than that in acidic media.[14] The binding energy for oxygen adsorption (ΔG(O*)) can be used as a descriptor to predict the ORR activity of electrocatalyst, and the activity volcano plot for different surface reactivity presents that the ΔG(O*) in acid is significantly lower than that in alkaline media (Figure 1B).[15] Thus, developing efficient ORR catalysts in acidic media is much more challenging. Moreover, Pt-based materials usually occupy the peak positions of the volcano plot, while the surface reactivity of Fe/N/C closes the optimum ORR activity, making it a prospective ORR electrocatalyst to substitute Pt-based ones. Based on this volcano plot, producing favorable specific intermediates or lowering the energy barrier for O2 dissociation would be the effective strategy to optimize the ORR activities.
Other descriptors related to the electronic and structural features of ORR catalysts, including eg occupation, bulk thermochemistry, and charge-transfer energy for bulk-property-based descriptors and d-band center, surface distortion, and generalized coordination numbers for surface-property-based descriptors, are exploited to represent the relationship between the reaction intermediates and ORR catalysts.[16] Among them, eg occupation and d-band center are two popular descriptors used to predict the activity of ORR electrocatalysts. In general, eg occupancy at octahedral sites is applied to analyze the catalytic behaviors of transition-metal oxides (spinel, perovskite).[17] The eg orbital and molecular orbital of transition-metal ions and surface oxygen respectively play important roles to optimize ORR performance.[17] The exciting find is the quantitative relationship between the eg occupation and intrinsic ORR activity of perovskite, and the optimal ORR performance can be obtained when the eg occupation is slightly smaller than 1.0 (Figure 1C).[17] The strong orbital selectivity at the Fermi level induced by the formed eg occupation can affect the rate-determining step of ORR between the competitive displacement and regeneration of OH− on the transition-metal ions surface. The adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates can be governed by the localized d-band center, which can be extensively applied to predict the volcano relationship between ORR performance and εd (d-band center relative to the Fermi level) of transition metals or alloys.[18] Typically, Pt with appropriate εd position acts as the most efficient single metallic ORR electrocatalyst, and electrocatalysts with 0.0–0.4 eV weaker metal–oxygen bond strength than that of Pt can present the enhanced ORR performance.[19] Thus, the d-band center can be optimized by alloying, doping, or interfacial engineering to weak the metal–oxygen bindings and approach the volcano peak.[20]

Due to the existence of different reactive species under acidic media (H2O) and alkaline media (OH−), the OER reactions in the both media are slightly different from each other (Figure 1D).[13] The corresponding elementary steps are demonstrated as follows:

OER can proceed through two widely accepted mechanisms, including the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism proceeded on a single metal site, and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism proceeded on two neighboring metal sites. Similarly, for the adsorbate evolution mechanism of OER, the catalytic performance can be correlated to one descriptor of ΔG(O*). According to the volcano plot of the electrochemical kinetics for typical oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, and perovskite oxides (Figure 1E), the strong oxygen-binding could induce the formed rate-determining step of HOO* species on the left-hand side, and the formed rate-determining step of deprotonated HO* species on the right-hand side could be induced by the weak oxygen-binding.[21] Therefore, some strategies, including the substitution with foreign elements and the regulation of vacancies and strain, can be adopted to stabilize the HOO* intermediate without affecting the adsorption of HO*, resulting in an excellent OER catalysis.[22]
In addition, other popular bulk property-based descriptors, including eg occupancy and metal–oxygen covalency, are also closely correlated to the OER activity.[17, 23] The eg occupancy governs the bind strength with the oxygen-containing intermediates, and the intrinsic activity presents a volcano-shaped plot as a function of eg occupancy of transition metal oxides (Figure 1F).[24] It is generally considered that the lower eg occupancy can induce the stronger oxygen binding, and the optimal OER activity and high covalency of transition metal–oxygen bonds can be achieved with the eg occupancy value close to unity. To control perovskites followed the OER mechanism of lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism, metal–oxygen covalency descriptor acts as the basis for tuning the electronic structure.[25] Yagi and co-workers explained the higher activity of CaCu3Fe4O12 with similar eg occupancy compared with LaMnO3 by introducing covalency.[26] A higher metal–oxygen covalency corresponded to a larger O 2p character could improve the charge transfer between the active sites and adsorbates in the rate-determining step of OER.[24] Furthermore, the O p-band center closed to the Fermi level could boost the OER activity but decrease the stability of oxides.[27] It is generally considered that the most active oxides are found to be the least stable, which can be related to the unstable surface structure (surface defects, covalency).[28] Therefore, the “scaling-relationship” between OER activity and stability is a conundrum to overcome, especially in the harsh oxidative condition of acidic media.
3 ORR Electrocatalysts
ORR is an important half-reaction applied in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Highly efficient electrocatalysts, such as noble-metal-based catalysts, transition-metal-based catalysts, and carbon-based catalysts, are required to promote its sluggish kinetics and improve the device performance. In this section, various strategies, such as alloying and nanostructure regulation for noble-metal-based catalysts,[29] chemical doping, defect engineering, as well as modulating electronic structure for transition-metal-based catalysts and carbon-based catalysts,[30] will be reviewed for understanding their improved ORR activities.
3.1 Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
At present, noble metals, including Pt, Pd, and Au, are undoubtedly the most highly efficient ORR catalysts. Due to their scarce reserves and high price, increasing the intrinsic activity and improving the utilization ratio are the important issues. As reported, tuning electronic structures (d-band) and morphologies (surface strain, surface composition, and surface facet), and optimizing the reactant adsorption sites (defects and dimensional structure) are regarded as the main strategies to address the aforementioned issues.[29] Thereby, various precious electrocatalysts, especially Pt-based nanomaterials, have been developed for efficient ORR. The mass activity (MA), evaluated by the specific activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), is an important performance parameter and index to optimize the ORR activity and reduce the catalyst cost.[31]
3.1.1 Noble-Metal Materials
For the single-component noble-metal of Pt/Pd, the MA can be improved by regulating the chemical environment and fine structure, such as the exposed catalytic active surface, morphology, particle size, and near-surface strain. An early study indicates that the ORR activities of different Pt(hkl) crystal surfaces are increased in the order of (100) < (111) < (110).[32] Hence, developing different morphologies of noble-metal catalysts (concave/convex polyhedrons, nanowires, nanocages, and other complex architectures) with specific facets exposed is a good strategy, as more unsaturated coordinated sites can be generated to boost the ORR activity.[33] As an example, Pt concave nanocubes with high-index facets of (510), (720), and (830) presented significantly enhanced ORR activities, compared to other morphologies of Pt catalysts (cubes, cuboctahedra) and commercial Pt/C catalysts with low-index facets of (100) and (111).[34] Unfortunately, the MA of Pt concave nanocubes is limited due to their large size (>15 nm). Decreasing the particle size is another good strategy, which can enhance the quantity of accessible surface atoms to improve the ORR activity. Furthermore, strain tuning can optimize the lattice fringe of surface atoms, and a reactivity–strain relationship can provide guidelines to tune ORR activity.[20, 35] For instance, the shape-controlled ultrafine jagged Pt nanowires with high surface strain and uncoordinated rhombus-rich surface configurations exhibited a competitive MA of 13.6 A mgPt−1 (Figure 2A,B).[36] A compressive strain was beneficial to weaken the Pt surface adsorption and thus optimize the ORR activity, but tensile strain had an opposite effect. The deposited Pt nanofilm with both compressively and tensely strained states successfully illustrated the different strain effects on the Pt surface adsorption.[37] These different strain states induced the shift of d-band center of Pt nanofilm, leading to a variation of ORR activity.

3.1.2 Noble-Metal Alloy Materials
Owing to similar properties of noble metals, the construction of different surface structures of Pd@M (M = Pd, Pt, and Au), including nanodendrite and core–shell (cubic, octahedral, icosahedral, hollow, and nanocage), is an effective strategy to optimize the ORR performance.[38] DFT calculations indicate that the weakened ∆EO at the M surfaces accounted for the enhanced ORR activity of Pd@Mn.[39] For example, the constructed Pd@Pt core–shell decahedra presented the boosted ORR activity and durability.[40] Synergistic effects between ligand and strain in the concave crystals with high-index facets contributed to the enhanced activity. Furthermore, the different exposed facets and surface composition of Pd@Pt catalysts have also been widely investigated. For instance, hollow Pt–Pd nanocages with well-defined facets (111 or 100) showed a significantly improved ORR activity over solid Pd@Pt nanocrystals.[41] In the followed work, the effect of Pt atomic layers on the ORR activities of Pd@PtnL core–shell was studied by depositing different numbers of Pt atomic layers on the Pd cores.[42] Specifically, due to the edge substitution of Pd to Pt, Pd@Pt1L octahedra tended to occur a slightly mixed surface composition, which could make the favorable ORR energetics exist on pure Pt shells compared to Pd–Pt shells.[42] Nevertheless, for Pd@Pt core–shell nanocatalysts, the electrochemical selective leaching of their core Pd elements during the accelerated durability test leads to the undesirable structural degradation and poor stability. Based on the adjustable ligament and pore sizes of nanoporous metals, various Pt–Pd–Au alloy catalysts have been developed for efficient and stable ORR.[43] For instance, an unsupported nanoporous catalyst with a Pt–Pd shell on Au was constructed, its initial MA could increase during the first 30 000 cycles and keep stable even after 70 000 cycles.[43] Due to the thermodynamically stable and leaching resistance of Ir during ORR process, another research direction is to create Pd@Pt–Ir for the improved ORR activity and durability.[44] The facet-dependent catalytic properties of Pd@Pt–Ir nanocrystals with boosted ORR activity could be ascribed to the easier protonation of O* and OH* under the coverage of OH* after the incorporation of Ir atoms into Pt lattice (Figure 2C).[45]
Noble metal (Pt/Pd) alloyed with transition metals (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V, Cu, etc.) is another effective strategy to boost its intrinsic activity toward ORR, as it can lower the εd of Pt, modulate the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates on the metal surface, and increase its surface exposure and compressive strain.[46] It is generally accepted that the d-band center can determine the surface adsorption properties of Pt-based alloy, and the ligand/strain effect can be introduced by incorporating other transition metal atoms with Pt.[47] DFT calculations illustrated a volcano-type relationship as a function of d-band center existed for PtM alloys. Among them, Pt3Co, Pt3Ni, and Pt3Fe alloys at the top of volcano plot were supposed to present efficient ORR activity.[20] Similarly, the MA of PtM alloys can be improved by regulating the chemical environment and fine structure, such as the exposed catalytic active surface, morphology, strain tuning, and electronic states, which can weaken the chemisorbed surface oxygen species and make a downshift of d-band.[48] For example, the synergistic interaction between ultralow-loading Pt of strained Pt–Co core–shell nanoparticles and a Pt-group metal-free catalytic substrate together contributed the improved MA of 1.77 A mgPt−1 and durability toward ORR (Figure 2D).[49] Furthermore, bimetallic PtNi catalyst with higher ORR activity attracts wide attention. Compared with the Pt(111) facet, the boosted ORR performance on the Pt3Ni(111) surface is induced by the synergistic effect between the downshifted d-band center (0.34 eV), ligand and morphology, resulting in the improved utilization ratio of Pt and adsorption strength (Figure 2E).[46, 50] As an example, highly crystalline PtNi3 nanoframes with open structure showed sufficient exposure of Pt(111) and the surface strain of Pt atoms, these synergistic effects were beneficial for improving the ORR activity.[51]
Moreover, highly ordered alloy or intermetallics with strong Pt–M interaction and increased Pt–M bonding can tune the local Pt atomic structure, resulting in more advanced intrinsic properties compared with the disordered alloys.[52] Compared to the rich-Pt ordered intermetallic and low-Pt disordered alloy catalysts, this core–shell structured PtCo3 ordered catalyst exhibited a durably compressive Pt surface and high ORR activity. The PtM alloys present remarkable ORR activity, nevertheless, the leaching of reactive transition metal under the realistic condition (corrosive environment in the acid at high potentials/voltages) limits their durability.[52d,53] Alloying Pt with a smaller electronegativity of early transition metal (Y, Gd, Tb, etc.) is efficient to improve the ORR activity and stability by suppressing the lattice atom diffusion, as they can donate electrons and thus reduce the εd of Pt.[19, 54] For instance, various Pt–lanthanide/early transition metal catalysts demonstrated a volcano relationship between the ORR activity and the lattice parameter of these metals (Figure 2F).[47] For another example, ultrathin PtGa alloy nanowires with an unconventional p–d hybridization interaction exhibited a boosted ORR performance and slightly MA loss after the durability test for 30 000 cycles.[55]
3.1.3 Single-Atom-Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with unique electronic structure, unsaturated coordination environments of the active centers, and fully exposed active sites can realize the maximum efficiency of 100%, which exhibits promising potential comparing with their particle form. In particular, Pt-based SAC shows superior ECSA and competitive ORR activity at the lower loadings. However, it is challenging to fabricate SACs and maintain atomic dispersion of metal species with low-cost equipment and high yield.
Recently, different wetness impregnation, coprecipitation, atomic layer deposition, galvanic replacement, photochemical reduction, and spatial confinement strategies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based SAC in the easy operation and possibility of large-scale manufacturing.[56] For example, Pt SAC with 0.4% Pt loading on the N-doped carbon black support was fabricated by wetness impregnation, which showed a high Pt utilization (0.13 gPt kW−1) in fuel cells.[57] DFT calculations indicated the doped pyridinic-N on carbon strongly anchored Pt single atoms for highly active ORR. To prevent the migration and agglomeration of Pt SAC, photochemical solid-phase reduction was adopted to synthesize atomic distributed Pt with 3.8 wt% loading on N-doped porous carbon.[58] The pyridine-type Pt–N4 coordination could stabilize Pt SAC and serve as the active site, thus the optimized chemical and electronic structure of Pt–N4 contributed to the boosted ORR activity. Furthermore, the coordination environment of metal center is an important part of the active site, which plays a decisive role in determining the ORR activity. For instance, the MA of synthesized Pt/MoN (Pt atoms coordinated with N) was 15 times higher compared to Pt/α-MOC SAC (Pt atoms coordinated with Mo) with similar Pt loading (Figure 2G).[59] DFT calculations implied Pt coordinated with N atoms modulated the electronic properties of Pt and induced more positive charge on Pt, leading to a relatively weaker adsorption of OH* and better ORR performance (Figure 2H).
3.2 Transition-Metal-Based Catalysts
Transition-metal-based compounds in the form of oxides/carbides/phosphides/sulfides and single-atom composites are abundant and cost-effective for ORR, which makes them viable alternatives to the precious ones for large-scale application in renewable energy technologies. Nevertheless, their poor intrinsic activities compared to noble-metal-based catalysts, especially their stability under acidic condition, are not satisfied for long-term operation. Recently, various strategies including defect engineering, modulating electronic structure, and integration of conductive supports have been developed to regulate their ORR activity.
3.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides/Carbides
Generally, the ORR activities of transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) oxides are related to the eg occupation and metal–oxygen covalency.[17] For example, the presence of oxygen vacancies of MnO2 improved the oxygen-containing species interaction and decreased the kinetic barrier, resulting in the boosted ORR performance.[60] However, the low electrical conductivity restricts their ORR activity. Vanadium (V) with metallic behavior can be introduced to modulate the electronic structure and conductivity of cobalt oxides.[61] As an example, a spinel oxide (Co2VO4) was reported by combining the V atom chain with electrically active Co cation.[62] Compared to the parent cobalt oxides, the conductivity of Co2VO4 increased with several orders of magnitude. Experimental and simulation analysis implied that the Co(II) cations at the octahedral sites showed a low spin state with one eg electron, which was beneficial for the optimized thermodynamics of ORR. Integrating carbon materials with them is a usual method to enhance conductivity. For instance, N-doped graphene support incorporated Co3O4 exhibited competitive ORR activity in alkaline solution due to synergetic chemical coupling.[63] Similarly, tubular monolayer superlattices of hollow Mn3O4 nanocrystal with the thin carbon coating showed the improved electron transport and enhanced ECSA for the competitive ORR performance.[64] However, these transition oxides only present good ORR activity in alkaline media, the acidic environment will cause serious corrosion at higher working potentials.
Carbides of group IV through VI metals, with Pt-like catalytic features and strong corrosion resistance to acid, have been widely investigated.[65] Recently, metal center and carbon are the proposed active sites in these carbides, therefore, defect engineering of carbon, morphology and strain tuning of carbides are effective strategies to improve their ORR performance. For instance, tungsten carbide encapsulated in high-defective graphitic layers with high density of sub-nanometer porous channels obviously improved the conductivity and optimized the penetration and exchange for different components, which effectively suppressed the agglomeration and coarsening of catalysts during the ORR process (Figure 3A).[66] As a new type carbide, Mxenes with high ECSA, superior electrical conductivity, thermostability, and strong corrosion resistance to acid are the promising potential in electrocatalysis.[67] In this regard, a series of MC2 (TiC2, VC2, NbC2, TaC2, MoC2) were investigated as electrocatalysts for ORR.[68] TaC2 and MoC2 demonstrated superior ORR activity compared to Pt, which could be ascribed to the presence of dual-active-site. More importantly, this optimized active site could break the scaling relationships of traditional single-active-site. Meanwhile, transition metal carbides with two or more metals endow a higher ORR activity than that of a single-metal counterpart because of the existence of synergistic effects and surface strain between each component.[69] As an example, CoFe carbide nanostructures encapsulated within N-doped graphene nanosheets synergistically offered more active sites and improved the interfacial charge transfer, accompanying with the optimized oxygen adsorption energy.[70]

3.2.2 Transition Metal Nitrides/Sulfides/Phosphides
Transition metal nitrides with high electrical conductivity and good corrosion resistance present higher ORR activity and stability than that of transition metal oxides.[71] For instance, the tubular assembly of Ti0.8Co0.2N nanosheets with modified electronic structure by Co doping presented considerable ORR performance.[72] Other nanoparticulate ZrN with strong d-orbital state, similar oxygen adsorption energy of stable Zr-terminated surface and high electron localization at a small Zr–O cluster showed a superior ORR activity and stability, which even surpassed Pt in alkaline environments (Figure 3B).[73] Similarly, integrating carbon materials with nitrides can also boost the ORR performance. For instance, a novel favorable ORR electrocatalyst was synthesized by mounting TiCoNx nanoparticles on the N-doped reduced graphene oxide support.[74] The synergy between TiCoNx and support and the significantly increased active pyridinic-N species accounted for the surpassed ORR activity.
Similar to the oxides and nitrides, metal sulfides also show some promising ORR catalysis. Interfacial engineering, defect engineering, morphology, and electron structure tuning are also good to optimize their intrinsic activities. With the interfacial nanocrystals engineering at atomic level, CuS/NiS2 with well-defined defects and interface demonstrated excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance compared to commercial Pt/C (Figure 3C).[75] As another example, the regulated electron structure of active sites by anion modulation in Co3FeS1.5(OH)6 demonstrated a comparable ORR activity to Pt/C.[76] Furthermore, Co9S8/C nanosheets with rich active sites and nanosheet structure considerably contributed to its excellent ORR catalytic performance and great long-term stability.[77] Incorporating phosphorus with transition metals can also increase the stability and corrosion resistance of transition metals themselves, consequently endows a huge potential for ORR electrocatalysts.[78] However, metal phosphides with inferior electronic conductivity hinder their electrocatalytic activity and electron transfer process. Combining metal phosphides with carbon materials can improve their surface area and electrical conductivity. However, the dissolution and precipitation of cobalt oxides on the surface of Co2P particles during the ORR process participated into their excellent stability in both acidic and alkaline environments (Figure 3D,E).[79] Other chromium phosphide also shows the merits of high thermal stability, good resistivity to oxidation and anticorrosion.[80] Mixed with carbon, the strong oxygen adsorption on the CrP surface facilitated the cleavage of O2 and demonstrated excellent ORR activity and stability in alkaline environment.
3.3 Carbon-Based ORR Catalysts
Carbon-based nanomaterials show the merits of abundant reserves, low cost, superior conductivity, and strong resistance to acid and alkali media, which have been widely used as the ORR catalysts. Nevertheless, the poor adsorption/activation of oxygen and its intermediates exists for pristine carbon.[81] Recently, the regulation strategies, including chemical doping, physical intermolecular charge transfer, and structural defects, have been adopted to develop efficient carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.[30]
3.3.1 Heteroatom-Doped Carbon Materials
Doping heteroatoms (including N, B, S, P, O, F, etc.) into carbon materials is effective to construct metal-free alternatives. Because of the different electronegativity between carbon and heteroatoms, heteroatom doping into carbon nanomaterials can induce the local charge redistribution of neighbor carbon atoms, leading to the changed electron state and thus the improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, the existence of covalent bond between carbon and doped heteroatom accounts for good ORR stability without segregation phenomenon.[30] For instance, the doped N atoms can make partial positive charge shift to the adjacent C atoms, leading to a higher electrical conductivity and surface hydrophilicity.[82] Another example of a sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst showed the promoted O2 adsorption and electron transfer, which contributed to a superior ORR performance under alkaline conditions and slightly lower acidic ORR activity than Pt/C (Figure 4A,B).[83] Usually, carbon electrocatalysts with rich defects present superior ORR activity than doped heteroatoms (including F, N, S, P, B, etc.) into carbon materials.[84] Nevertheless, the real active sites of these N-doped carbon for ORR under acidic environment are controversial. A proof-of-concept study was introduced to evaluate the real active site of pyridinic N dominated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.[85] An edged pentagon of carbon defect could be selectively created by controllable N doping, and the major active sites were proved to be pentagon defects in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, which showed superior ORR activity under acidic environment compared to the pyridinic N sites.

Furthermore, doping of B, P, or S into sp2-carbon can also optimize its ORR activity. For instance, S/N/P/B-doped carbon (carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene) with stable active sites were constructed by a dual doping strategy.[86] This dual-doped carbon demonstrated enhanced ORR catalytic activity and stability owing to the synergistic effect induced by the electronic interaction between different dopants. Another example of the unique hierarchical structure of N, S-codoped graphitic sheets containing stereoscopic holes was constructed (Figure 4C).[87] This unique architecture was beneficial for improving surface area and exposing active sites as well as promoting electron/electrolyte transport properties, resulting in superior ORR activity and stability compared other carbon materials.
3.3.2 Transition Metal-Doped Carbon Materials
Doping transition metal into carbon materials is another widely used strategy to achieve the effective ORR catalysts. Particularly, transition metal and N-codoped carbon in the form of M–N–C receive wide attention. Doping of N into sp2-carbon can serve as electron donor or acceptor when decorated with transition metal, furthermore, highly porous structural carbon with large surface area can enhance the exposure of active sites and mass transfer.[88] Assisted with the templated method, these M–N–C with various porous architectures are developed for electrocatalysis. For instance, mesoporous hollow spindle-like Fe–N–C catalysts were constructed by a novel “reactive hard template” approach.[89] The resultant Fe3C nanoparticles were encapsulated in N-doped graphitic layers by the polymerization on the Fe2O3 nanospindle templates and subsequent calcination. The easily accessible Fe–Nx centers and highly mesoporous structure accounted for the superior ORR activity. A straightforward and scalable molecule-confined pyrolysis strategy was further developed to construct a highly stable single Fe sites (with 3.5 wt% loading) on N-doped carbon nanosheets catalyst.[90] The as-synthesized catalyst presented superior ORR activity and stability in both alkaline and acidic environments compared to the commercial Pt/C. In addition, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used as self-template and pyrolyzed into transition metal-doped carbon materials with controllable porous structural characteristics and variable elemental composition.[91] For instance, a series of Co–Co3O4-based nanoarchitectures were constructed and embedded in hollow N-doped carbon polyhedra with a multilevel architecture optimization (Figure 4D).[92] The optimal yolk@shell catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies, efficient mass transformation, and potential synergies of different components exhibited competitive ORR activity and stability. Nevertheless, these catalysts demonstrate limited ORR performance under acidic environment and the real active site (M–N or M–C) is still unconfirmed. Therefore, in-depth understanding of their active sites and reaction mechanism are helpful to improve the ORR efficiency.
3.3.3 Dopant-Free Carbon Materials
The enhanced ORR activity of doped carbon-based electrocatalysts are usually ascribed to different dopants, while their contribution to the origin of ORR activity and intrinsic carbon defects are far from exploration. Recently, the defect-rich dopant-free carbon with unusual electronic properties has been considered as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in both alkaline and acidic environment.[93] For example, the dopant-free carbon nanocages were adopted to illustrate the effect of intrinsic carbon defects on the ORR activity.[94] The pentagon and zigzag edge are two typical carbon defects accounting in the ORR improvement. Nevertheless, conventional carbon nanomaterials with multiple defect sites hindered the recognition between the performance characteristics and specific carbon defects. In this regard, graphene nanoribbons with relatively single defects and exposed zigzag carbon showed the superior ORR electrocatalytic activity than other carbon atoms (oxidized zigzag/basal plane/armchair edge carbon), and the N-doped counterpart, as well as most reported nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts (Figure 4E,F).[95]
4 OER Electrocatalysts
As the most important half-reaction involved in metal–air battery and hybrid water electrolysis, the OER is also sluggish and its pathway is only the reverse process of ORR. Effective and robust electrocatalysts are also highly desired to accelerate OER process. Great efforts have been dedicated to developing OER electrocatalysts in various noble-metal-based materials,[96] transition-metal-based oxides,[97] hydroxides,[98] oxyhydroxides,[99] chalcogenides,[100] pnictides,[101] phosphides,[102] and nonmetal hybrids.[103] Several strategies have also been devised to fabricate the electrocatalysts with optimized micro/electronic structure from the aspects of surface reconstruction,[104] doping chemistry,[105] coordination tuning,[106] and defect engineering.[107] Herein, some of the recently developed OER electrocatalysts are summarized to discuss the possible structure–activity relationship.
4.1 Noble-Metal-Based Catalysts
In general, the noble metals Ru and Ir feature high OER activities in both acidic and alkaline solutions so that the initial studies of OER electrocatalysts are devoted to Ru- and Ir-based materials.[108] However, their performance are greatly influenced by the morphologies, crystal structures, and local electronic structures. To this end, 3D Ir superstructure composed of ultrathin nanosheets exhibited excellent OER activities with an onset overpotential of 200 mV in acidic solution, which was much better than that of small Ir nanoparticles.[109] Moreover, the IrNi alloy-based materials with porous structure and high surface area generally featured excellent OER durability, which was attributed to the leaching effects of less stable Ni species to form the Ir-rich surfaces.[110] Further in-depth investigations revealed the lattice vacancies could be produced with shortened IrO bonds during the Ni leaching, which induced the generation of d-band holes in the IrOx shells (Figure 5A).[111] In this case, the oxygen ligands (active metal oxides) that formed on the surface were regarded as the catalytic active sites.

Among the noble metal oxides, RuO2 features the excellent OER performance.[112] Meanwhile, the OER mechanism on RuO2 surface have been studied by in situ measurements and DFT calculations, in which rutile (100) orientation is the most active and no lattice oxygen exchange occurs on the crystalline RuO2 surfaces during the OER process.[108, 113] However, the major drawback of RuO2 is its poor stability under high anodic potential (>1.4 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). Whereas, RuO2 will transform into the dissolvable RuO4 and its activity is consequently deteriorated (Figure 5B).[114] Generally, IrO2 exhibits a slightly worse activity than RuO2, but it possesses a relatively superior OER stability. Therefore, combining Ru and Ir to form bimetallic oxides have been studied to realize a balance between activity and stability.[115] As expected, the RuIrOx nanonetcages with porous hollow structure exhibited remarkably improved activity relative to the pure RuOx catalyst, which was mainly due to the synergistic effect between Ir and Ru that decreased the energy barrier of the limiting step (O*–HOO*).[116] Also, the OER activity deterioration is significantly mitigated after the Ir doping (Figure 5C).[117] Moreover, following the architecture construction of IrO2 and RuO2, for instance, core–shell structure, the significant enhancement of both activity and stability can be realized.[118]
4.2 Transition-Metal-Based Catalysts
4.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides
Generally, transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts for alkaline OER can be classified as monometallic oxides, bimetallic spinel-type oxides, and perovskite oxides. As a typical monometallic oxide, Co3O4 has been widely investigated as a promising non-noble-metal electrocatalyst.[119] In recent years, researchers designed nanoscale Co3O4 from the aspects of engineering nanostructure and electronic structure for improving the OER activity.[120] Engineering the nanostructure could be achieved by optimizing the morphology to increase active sites, while the coordination tuning could realize the local electronic structure optimization. For instance, the ultrathin and porous Co3O4 sheets provided a large surface area and enriched coordinated-unsaturated surface atoms, which could accelerate the charge transfer and OER kinetics.[121] Similarly, mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes were also developed, in which the interconnected architecture endowed the mesoporous Co3O4 excellent mechanical robustness to withstand the impact from the generated O2 bubbles.[122] In addition, the incorporation of oxygen vacancies into Co3O4 structure could further achieve the improvement of electrocatalytic performance.[123] DFT calculations revealed that the oxygen vacancies could create defect states at the bandgap and the electrons could be easily excited, which would bring the improved conductivity of Co3O4 and finally result in the enhanced OER activity.[123]
Compared to monometallic spinel oxides, bimetallic spinel oxides present much better OER performance.[124] The electrocatalytic activity of these oxides can be reasonably optimized in terms of valence states and components. A systematic investigation on ZnCo2O4 and CoAl2O4 was performed to disclose the contribution of Co2+Td and Co3+Oh ions to the OER activity.[125] The electrochemical results showed the performance of CoAl2O4 for OER was superior to that of ZnCo2O4, suggesting that the Co2+Td dominated the OER activity (Figure 6A). Based on the operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results, a reasonable conjecture was proposed that the Co3+Oh was responsible for the double-layer capacitance due to its strong OH− affinity behavior, while the Co2+Td was responsible for OER. Interestingly, the high OER nature of Co2+Td was derived from its low oxidation state, which was favorable for the release of electrons during OER to form the CoOOH acting as the main active sites (Figure 6B). Moreover, the study of the ferrite system revealed that the OER activity followed the trend CoFe2O4 > CuFe2O4 > NiFe2O4 > MnFe2O4,[126] implying that the electronic structure and electrocatalytic performance of bimetallic spinel oxides could be optimized by tuning the components.

Perovskite oxides with ABO3 structure also show favorable electrocatalytic activity due to the modulated electronic structure and work function after transition metal substitution (Figure 6C).[112, 127] It has been proposed that the OER performance trend of different perovskite oxides could be theoretically described by the descriptors of free energies of OOH* and OH* species.[128] A novel activity descriptor for perovskites was further developed on the basis of eg electron occupancy principle.[24] In detail, when the eg electron occupancy of surface transition metal ions was close to unity, an optimal OER activity could be obtained (Figure 6D). In this case, the difference of OER activity between BaNiO3 and BaNi0.83O2.5 could be explained based on this descriptor.[129] The Ni vacancy enriched BaNi0.83O2.5 with the eg electron occupancy near unity exhibited a smaller overpotential and higher activity than BaNiO3 with a near zero eg occupancy (Figure 6E,F). Moreover, the free energy difference between OO* and OOH* of BaNi0.83O2.5 was lower than that of BaNiO3, further suggesting that the oxygen adsorption energies could be affected by electrons on both eg and t2g orbitals (Figure 6G).[129] Indeed, too weak (LaMnO3) or too strong (LaCuO3) adsorption energy is not suitable for OER, therefore, a moderate adsorption energy (LaCoO3 and LaNiO3) is beneficial to promote the OER performance.[130]
4.2.2 Transition Metal (Oxy)Hydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as a typical 2D material show great potential for electrochemical energy conversion systems.[131] Particularly, Ni or Co-containing LDHs attract extensive attention and exhibit extraordinary OER activity.[132] For example, the Co species in ZnCo-LDH contributed to the superior activity of OER.[133] With further Fe doping into Co(OH)2 to form the CoFe-LDH, the Fe doping could induce the increase of interlayer space of CoFe-LDH, which could serve as the “ion-buffering reservoirs” for electrolyte ions, thus leading to an enhanced mass transfer behavior.[134] In addition, the OER activity of CoMn-LDH could be further enhanced after the anodic conditioning treatment, which is mainly because the Mn ions could leach from the CoMn-LDH structure during treatment and more highly active Co(IV) species were formed in the LDH structure.[135]
To address the problems of the dimensional confinement and increase the active sites of LDHs, the bulk LDHs are usually exfoliated to form few layer nanosheets with increased active sites and optimized conductivity. The typical liquid-phase exfoliation strategy was employed to prepare single-layer LDHs and study their OER activities (Figure 7A).[136] As expected, the few/single-layer LDHs exhibited dramatically enhanced OER performance than the bulk counterparts, which was attributed to the increased active surface area and more exposed edge sites. In addition, the Ar plasma etching method was developed to exfoliate CoFe-LDH, and multiple kinds of vacancies were spontaneously produced in the ultrathin nanosheets.[137] Sequentially, a similar water-plasma-enabled exfoliation method was further developed to prepare ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets (Figure 7B), in which the exfoliated ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets significantly increase the active sites and vacancies (including O, Co, and Fe vacancies). Correspondingly, the coordinate numbers of transition metals were reduced and the surface electronic structure was modulated, thus leading to the improved intrinsic OER activity (Figure 7C).[137] Additionally, the electrochemical exfoliation is an effective strategy to exfoliate 2D materials such as graphite and black phosphorus. Therefore, the electrochemical exfoliation method shows great promise for the exfoliation of LDHs, which has yet not been demonstrated in this material field.

After the deduction of protons from hydroxide materials, the layer-structured metal oxyhydroxides will be generated, which also demonstrate the featured electrocatalytic OER activity. The systematic study demonstrated that the OER activities of transition-metal oxyhydroxides (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) followed the order Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, suggesting that NiOOH featured the superior OER activity, owing to the ideal bonding energy between Ni and OH.[138] However, the OER activity of NiOOH was sensitive to the impurities such as Fe ions, and the overpotential of Ni1−xFexOOH dropped by 200 mV when the Fe content reached 25% (Figure 7D,E).[139] The Fe ions from solution prefer to incorporate into NiOOH at surface/edge/defect sites and significantly affecting the Ni redox behavior.[140] However, two options existed regarding the real active site: one is that the incorporated Fe species possess more higher activity, while the other is that the activity of Ni sites can be enhanced after the substitution of Fe due to the modulated electronic property. The systematical DFT calculations unambiguously revealed the active ability of the surface Ni and Fe sites, demonstrating that the Fe species feature an optimal adsorption energy while Ni sites cannot provide sufficient activity for the reduced OER overpotential observed experimentally.[141] Therefore, in the Ni1−xFexOOH system, the Fe species are the real OER active sites, and the incorporation of Fe species led to a higher OER activity and a lower OER overpotential (Figure 7F). Moreover, the operando Mössbauer spectroscopy suggested the presence of Fe4+ on NiFe oxyhydroxide during OER, indicative of the facile oxidation of Fe3+ in NiOOH lattice.[142] In addition, the OER activity of NiFe oxyhydroxide could be further improved after the decoration of iron sulfide was constructed by microorganism corrosion, which was attributed to the synergistic effect between oxyhydroxides and sulfide species (Figure 7G,H).[143] The doping of Fe in CoOOH system also showed a similar effect in its OER activity improvement.[144] Moreover, Fe dopants could not only facilitate the OER process but also modulate the morphologic and electronic structure of CoOOH. The Fe sites featured much stronger adsorption ability toward HO*, HOO*, and O* species than the Co sites.[145] With the further introduction of Fe and W species into CoOOH, the as-made FeCoW oxyhydroxide featured the ideal energy state and showed excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm−2. The W with a lower oxidation state was expected to be produced during OER, while the Co was more readily oxidized to high valence. The favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure produced by the synergistic interplay of W, Fe, and Co contributed to the enhanced OER activity.[146] Since Fe species are the reactive sites in both CoFeOOH and NiFeOOH systems, the FeOOH would be a promising OER electrocatalyst. Nevertheless, the OER activity of pure FeOOH itself is poor at low overpotential, which can be attributed to its insulative characteristic and low conductivity.[147] Integrating FeOOH with Co or CeO2 to fabricate heterostructures on conductive substrate could overcome these drawbacks to some degree.[148] In addition, the electrochemically driven coordination tuning of FeOOH with unsaturated FeO6 coordination geometry could enhance the conductivity and activate the intrinsic OER activity.[106]
4.2.3 Transition Metal Pnictides and Chalcogenides
In recent years, transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides are emerging as attractive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Amazingly, they also show great promising for OER, which can serve as the bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, these materials are unstable under OER conditions and can be easily oxidized, of which the resulted oxides/hydroxides shell are considered to be the real OER electrocatalytic species.[149] When they were empolyed for OER electrocatalysis, the FeS nanosheets were transformed into amorphous FeOx film with porous structure.[150] Likewise, the deselenization process occurred on NiSe nanorods and the surface was oxidized during OER, thus resulting in the NiSe/NiOx core/shell structure.[151] Recent reports also demonstrated that the surface of Co2P would be oxidized to CoOx during OER reaction.[152] Furthermore, this transformation can entail the bulk structures. The full bulk-structure reconstruction could occurr on the cobalt–iron phosphide to form the highly active amorphorized cobalt–iron oxyhydroxide during OER.[153] The half-operando characterizations confirmed that the phosphorus species were oxidized and leached from the phosphide, further promoting the oxidation of residual cobalt–iron species for in-depth bulk structure reconstruction and amorphorization. Similar phenomena have also been observed on transition metal nitrides, which are mainly due to that the enthalpies of these materials are more positive than those of the oxide.[154] From this standpoint, transition metal chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides almost feature a high probability of transforming into oxides/(oxy)hydroxides during OER process. Nevertheless, these as-derived electrocatalysts generally exhibit superior OER performance than the corresponding oxides/(oxy)hydroxides that are directly prepared, which is mainly due to the high surface roughening and surface area as well as the increased amorphous surface state induced by the structure reconstruction during OER.[149] In this regard, transition metal pnictides and chalcogenides can serve as the precursors or precatalysts to the real active OER electrocatalysts.
4.3 Carbon-Based OER Catalysts
In addition to the metal-based electrocatalysts, nonmetal-based materials as OER electrocatalysts have emerged and developed rapidly. Most of currently available nonmetal OER electrocatalysts are carbon-based materials such as heteroatoms (N, O, P, and S) doped carbons (graphene[155] and CNTs[156]) and carbon-based hybrids (C3N4–CNT,[157] C3N4–graphene,[158] and graphene–CNT[159]). For example, carbon nanotubes with oxidized surface delivered a remarkable OER performance, which was even comparable to the metal-based electrocatalysts.[160] Furthermore, the OER performance of nanocarbons can be optimized by tuning morphologies structure with the increased surface area. Specifically, the unique 3D architecture with large surface area and enriched active sites was developed based on the N, O-codoped graphene and CNTs.[155] The doping of N in CNTs can facilitate the breaking of OH bonds of H2O and the formation of O2. However, the real active sites of the N doping carbon materials is still unclear. Similar to the element of N, P has the same valence electrons as N with a larger atomic size and lower electronegativity. In this case, doping P into carbons can modulate the local charge density and produce the defect-induced active surface for O* adsorption.[161] In addition, the doping of B can also increase the graphitization of CNTs, in which the resistivity can be significantly reduced.[162] The Fermi level of CNTs can shift to valence band after B doping, thus resulting in the enhanced OER activity.[163] Nevertheless, the oxidation or corrosion always occurs on the carbon-based materials at high OER potential, thus leading to the service failure and limited durability. Moreover, metal-free, or not, in the carbon catalyst is doubt for understanding the active sites in the OER, as the imuprities in the materials or test environment would promote the activity. With further developed observation techniques and theoretical analysis, these understandings would be helpful for the design of efficient carbon catalyst for OER.
5 Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts
As the reverse redox of OER and ORR, both reactions are featured with the consistent free energy diagram while different directions. For a given electrocatalyst, it might show apparently fast reaction rate, while the reaction process of the opposite direction might become hard to be realized. Getting favorable bifunctional activities in a single material structure is the main function and target for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, which is highly desired for the rechargeable metal–air battery and regenerated fuel cells.
5.1 Noble-Metal-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
Pt- and Ir-based noble metals are well-known benchmark electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. However, their widely practical application is seriously limited by the high cost. To address this problem, some strategies have been presented including alloying with low cost OER/ORR electrocatalysts and nanostructuring these noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Besides, alloying noble metals with other low-cost metals would be more attractive to stimulate the activity and meanwhile lower the cost. Typically, Ag–Cu alloy electrocatalyst with dendrite structure showed a good bifunctionatlity for both OER and ORR.[164] DFT calculations demonstrated that the oxygen adsorption energy of Ag–Cu alloy clusters was increased compared with pure Ag clusters. In addition, coating the carbon support with noble-metal-based electrocatalysts have been proposed in recent studies. For example, mesoporous carbon nanofiber with uniform RuO2 coating was employed as bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR.[165] However, it is hard to fabricate the atomically coupled interfaces between noble metals and non-noble materials. To this end, the magnetron sputtering technique was used to deposit Pt nanoparticles onto CoO surface.[166] DFT calculation results confirm an apparent electron transfer from CoO to Pt, leading to electron-rich area on Pt and electron-deficient area on CoO. Moreover, the electron donation from CoO to Pt effectively tunes the d-band structure of Pt, which results in downshifting the d-band center of Pt (111) surface. Benefiting from the strong interaction between Pt and CoO, significant electrocatalytic performance and durability enhancement have been demonstrated.
5.2 Transition-Metal-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
5.2.1 Transition Metal Oxides
Transition-metal elements have more than one valence, which can be built into various chemical compounds with different crystal structures.[167] Among them, transition metal oxides in the form of spinel oxides and mixed-metal perovskites are promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Hence, spinel oxides and perovskites are the core topics of this section.
For the spinel oxides, the active site and site activity are determined by their crystal structure, plane, and geometry. For example, Co3O4 with octahedral geometry featured much better activities than the cubic phase.[168] DFT calculations further demonstrated that Co3O4 octahedron featured a much lower O2 desorption activation barrier than cubic one, except much more active sites. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the Co3O4 enclosed by (112) facets exhibited higher bifunctional performance than that of (001) and (111) facets.[169] Bimetallic Co–Mn spinel oxides are another promising candidate as bifunctional electrocatalysts among all the transition metal oxides.[170] The spinel structure could be tuned by varying the Co/Mn ratio, in which the crystallographic structure showed cubic spinel phase at low Mn proportions, while the tetragonal spinel structure was presented at high Mn proportions (Figure 8A). The tetragonal spinel c-CoMn2 featured much higher OER and ORR activities and better stabilities, which were attributed to the abundant ionic defects, smaller particle sizes, and higher active surface area. Besides, CoxMn3−xO4 spinel oxides with controllable crystallographic phase showed two spinel oxides of CoMnO–P and CoMnO–B with cubic and tetragonal spinel phases (Figure 8B).[124] The cubic spinel phase exhibited better ORR activity than the tetragonal spinel phase, while the OER performance followed a different trend. In detail, the Co defect site featured stronger oxygen adsorption ability than manganese defect site, and the cubic (113) surface could generate more stable oxygen adducts than tetragonal (121) surface. Therefore, the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities (OER and ORR) of tetragonal and cubic CoMnO spinel phase were attributed to the disparate oxygen adsorption binding energies of Co and the defect sites of Mn. Additionally, the eg filling of octahedral-coordinated Mn could also be employed to describe the OER/ORR activities. When the eg < 1, the OH− is hard to be regenerated for ORR. Similarly, the lower eg filling limits the M–OO2− formation, while the higher eg filling hinders the M–OOH− regeneration (Figure 8C). The moderate eg filling (close to unity) leads to the optimized OER/ORR activities. To realize the eg unity filling, the Mn should be in the 3-valent state (Figure 8D). Hence, creating oxygen vacancy to improve the ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+ can continuously increase the ORR/OER performance. This hypothesis can be extended to apply for other spinels including XFe2O4 (X = Co, Ni, and Mn), XCo2O4 (X = Co, Ni, and Zn), and LixMn2O4 (Figure 8E).[171]

As discussed in the previous section, perovskite oxides (ABO3) feature good OER performance, while their ORR activity is relatively poor. The conductivity and electrocatalytic activity could be enhanced by substituting of A and B sites with other cations. For example, the ORR activity was greatly improved by optimizing Mn cations at the B sites in mesoporous LaMnO3 perovskite.[172] Several simulation studies suggested that the cations doping could modulate the electronic structure of perovskites and further result in the enhanced electrocatalytic activity.[127, 173] In addition, a wide range of cations can act as the dopants to modulate the structure of perovskites. Ca(II) or Co(II) ion-doped LaMnO3 exhibited an enhanced ORR activity, which was mainly due to the presence of oxygen vacancies facilitate the diffusion of O2 within the structure.[174] Moreover, the partial substitution of La(II) by Ca(II) in La1−xCaxCoO3 (0.2 < x < 0.4) electrocatalysts could also lead to an increased active area and bifunctional performance.[175] The above examples show that the modulated electronic structure and defect properties of transition metals oxides can make them exhibit bifunctional activities for OER and ORR. In addition, the eg filling hypothesis also plays an important role in governing the OER/ORR activities for perovskite oxides. With eg filling close to unity, perovskites were found to show the optimal electrocatalytic performance.[24, 127] However, the values of eg filling are usually estimated by ex situ bulk-sensitive measurements, which is hard to obtain the accurate value.[176] Hence, the advanced surface-sensitive techniques are highly desired for accurately measuring the eg filling of catalysts during electrocatalysis.
5.2.2 Transition Metal Hydroxides
Transition-metal-based LDH materials have demonstrated excellent OER activity. However, the weak ORR activity of most LDHs greatly limits their application as bifunctional electrocatalysts. Fortunately, some of the Ni-based LDHs such as NiFe,[177] NiCo,[178] NiMn,[179] and NiRu-LDHs[180] show promising ORR activity. With further introduction of oxygen defects, the ternary O–NiCoFe-LDH catalyst exhibited outstanding bifunctional performance compared with the pristine NiCoFe-LDH.[181] Indeed, the intrinsically poor conductivity and small surface area can be addressed by coupling the conductive supports. For example, a hybrid of NiCoFe-LDH onto N-doped graphene oxide displayed remarkable bifunctional performance due to the synergistic effect between LDH and N-doped.[182] In addition, Ag nanoparticles decorated NiRu-LDH nanosheets would interestingly induce the formation of multivacancy sites, together with the synergistic effect between NiRu-LDH and Ag nanoparticles, the formation of Ag/NiRu LDH heterojuction accounted for the superb bifunctional electrocatalytic performance.[183] Although some of the Ni-based LDHs mentioned above have demonstrated bifunctional activity, limited research works on the quantification of site populations are reported. Therefore, theoretical studies are particularly needed in the future to examine the reaction mechanisms and active sites on the LDH-based materials to establish more rigorous structure–activity relationships.
5.2.3 Transition Metal Chalcogenides
In recent years, the Ni- and Co-based sulfides exhibit promising OER and ORR activities due to their electrochemically stable nature. For example, Co9S8 anchored onto the N, S-codoped carbon tubes, exhibited enhanced bifunctional ORR and ORR performance.[184] Further DFT calculations revealed that the intimate contact between Co9S8 nanoparticles and porous carbon tubes brought cooperative effects, favorable to promote the bifunctional activity. Similarly, the electrocatalytic activity of homogeneous bimetallic NiCo2S4 grown on N-doped carbon nanotubes could be tuned by tailoring the crystal size of NiCo2S4 and the resulting electrocatalyst featured higher bifunctional activity and excellent battery performance.[185] Another hybrid of CuS/NiS2 electrocatalysts would bring abundant defects and nanointerfaces, these atomic level-coupled interfaces between CuS and NiS2 could provide numerous active sites for effective bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.[186]
5.3 Carbon-Based Bifunctional Catalysts
Carbon-based materials have been demonstrated to exhibit high bifunctional activity and good stability for ORR and OER. The electrocatalytic performance of carbon-based materials could be optimized by geometry modulation, heteroatom doping, and surface functionality.[187] Doping the heteroatoms (N, S, P, or B) into carbon structure could modulate the electronic structure and surface electronic states to increase their bifunctional activities.[188] For example, the N-doped graphene exhibited excellent bifunctional OER/ORR activity and stability, of which the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N moieties were responsible for OER, whereas the electron-donating quaternary N sites were responsible for ORR.[189] Further, the N, S-codoped carbon nanosheets exhibited excellent OER and ORR bifunctional performance, which was even better than that of the metal-based electrocatalysts (Figure 9A,B).[190] With the construction of porous structure, the N, B dual-doped highly porous carbon also exhibited a high bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both OER and ORR.[191] Moreover, N, P-codoped carbon foam with large surface area of 1663 m2 g−1 demonstrated a high bifunction performance for oxygen electrocatalysis (Figure 9C,D). DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatoms (N and P) and edge effects played critical role for the bifunctional activities.[188] In detail, the adsorption of chemical species and electrocatalytic activities were determined by the distance of doping sites from the carbon edge. The N–P sites are responsible for OER, while the N-doped sites are responsible for ORR. Revealing the OER and ORR mechanisms on heteroatom-doped carbon materials is essential to finely optimize the bifunctional performance. Recently, the relationship between the intrinsic activity and heteroatoms in carbon materials would afford some guidelines for the fabrication of heteroatom-doped carbon electrocatalysts with high OER and ORR bifunctional activities (Figure 9E–G).[192] Various material structures such as heteroatom single-doped/codoped graphene have been calculated to establish a descriptor. Based on these results, key descriptors were identified for both ORR and OER on the carbon materials, in which the free energy difference between OH* and OOH* exhibited linear relationship. Note that the edge sites of the graphitic structure but different sites feature the minimum overpotentials for ORR and OER.

6 Electrochemical Energy Technologies
The increasing energy demands and sustainable environment call the advanced electrochemical energy technologies for sustainable development of human society. Fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and rechargeable metal–air batteries have been widely studied with the merits of low pollution emissions and high energy density. Oxygen electrocatalysts act as the key component in these energy technologies. To meet the requirements for their commercial application, low-cost, high-efficiency, and robust oxygen electrocatalysts are indispensable.
6.1 Fuel Cells
Fuel cells with high energy density and low pollution emissions are regarded as promising clean energy for vehicles and power systems to meet future energy challenges. Their commercializations are still limited to the precious noble metal electrocatalysts, such as the high loading and thermodynamically unstable of Pt during the fuel cells operation. In this respect, alloying Pt with 3d transition metals can improve the activity and stability of Pt catalysts by the synergetic effect of induced strain and ligand, accompanied with overcoming the cost by reducing the Pt usage. For instance, PtCo nanoparticles over Co–Nx–Cy substrate was constructed with ultralow Pt loading of 0.043 mgPt cm−2 in fuel cells.[49] The synthesized catalyst demonstrated a high MA (1.77 A mgPt−1) and retained 64% of its initial MA after 30 000 cycles of durability test. Our group reported that the synthesis of bunched Pt–Ni alloy nanocages attained a superior power density of 0.92 W cm−2 and remained stable service over 180 h in H2–air fuel cell, which could be ascribed to highly strain Pt-rich surface and modified coordination environment with a weakened Pt–O binding strength after the appropriate incorporation of Ni (Figure 10A–C).[193] However, the leaching of transition metal occurred in acidic medium adversely affects the fuel cell durability. Therefore, to control the transition metal leaching and stabilize it in PtM alloy under acidic conditions, the hard-magnet L10-CoPt/Pt core-shell nanoparticles with the ligand effect of Co and the biaxial strain of Pt shell induced the lower binding of oxygenated species and contributed to boost ORR performance in fuel cells (Figure 10D,E).[194] Its initial MA (0.56 A mgPt−1) reduced by only 19% (0.45 A mgPt−1) after the durability test for 30 000 cycles, which surpassed the 2020 targets on Pt activity (0.44 A mgPt−1) and durability (<40% loss in the initial MA after 30 000 cycles) set by US Department of Energy (Figure 10F).

SACs with high ORR performance in fuel cell have attracted widely attention. Usually, the synergetic effect of N-coordinated local structure of Fe–N–C catalysts can induce lower adsorption energies for the oxygenated intermediates. For instance, a concave Fe–N–C SAC was reported with enhanced external surface area and mesoporosity, it demonstrated superior power density (1.18 W cm−2) and activity (0.047 A cm−2 at 0.8 ViR-free) in H2–O2 cell (Figure 10G,H).[195] Furthermore, atomic Fe-doped MOF-derived carbon polyhedrons with low loading of 1 mg cm−2 exhibited excellent power density (0.463 W cm−2) and good durability (32.2% voltage loss after 10 h) in a H2–O2 fuel cell.[196] Nevertheless, the Fe and peroxide are conducive to a free radicals generation that considerably degrades the organic ionomer and the membrane in the electrodes.[197] Therefore, ORR catalysts without Pt and Fe are urgently needed for inexpensive and durable fuel cell.[198] In this regard, nitrogen-coordinated atomically dispersed Co could inhibit the inactive metallic aggregation and expose highly dispersed CoN4 site into porous carbon, which significantly improved the catalyst durability in acidic media and thus enhanced the performance of fuel cell.[197] Due to the low active site density, the metal loadings of SACs need to be improved while maintaining the resolved and isolated active sites for their large-scale applications, thus there is a long way to realize their actual performance and stability.
6.2 Water Electrolyzer
Water electrolyzer is another conversion technology to transform solar energy into high-purity hydrogen. The electrolyzer consists of two main reactions including HER and OER (Figure 11A), and efficient electrocatalysts are indispensable to promote their sluggish kinetics.[199] For the overall water splitting, many noble-metal-free electrocatalysts have shown higher activity than the Pt/C–Ir/C couple in alkaline or neutral media. Recently, morphology, strain tuning, and interface engineering are effective strategies to design electrocatalysts with excellent activity. Among them, the 2D nanosheets with amorphous structure can induce the d-band center and binding strengths between the reaction intermediate reduce.[200] A novel amorphous FePO4 nanosheets grown on Ni foam presented superior catalytic performance,[201] and its assembled electrolyzer afforded the voltages of 1.54 V (10 mA cm−2) and 1.72 V (100 mA cm−2) in 1.0 m KOH (Figure 11B), accompanied with superior mechanical robustness and stability. A further example, ultrathin and amorphous NiFe oxyhydroxide with superior intrinsical activity, high surface areas, and reduced charge transfer resistance demonstrated excellent OER stability over 120 h at the high current densities of 1000 mA cm−2.[202] More importantly, the assembled electrolyzer (Ni nanowires as HER electrode) presented a low voltage of 1.76 V at the current density of 1000 mA cm−2 under alkaline media. The exciting find was the superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of CoMoSx chalcogel with abundant active sites/defects and the unique micro/nanostructure demonstrated excellent activity and stability toward overall water splitting (Figure 11C–E).[203] This synthesized catalyst needed low voltage (1.89 V) at 0.5 A cm−2 current density and maintained its activity for 100 h.

However, bifunctional electrocatalysts are gradually oxidized and usually dissolved into the acidic electrolyte. Based on synergistic effects occurring between HER and OER electrocatalysts, MoSe2 flakes with ball-like shaped Mo2C crystals supported by single-walled carbon nanotube were hybridized to improve the water-splitting performance in pH universal media.[204] The constructed tonanosized hollow RuIrOx nanonetcages by introduction of Ir induce the decreased energy barriers for both HER and OER, and the prevention of Ru from overoxidation under acidic OER environment (Figure 11F).[205] This nanonetcage catalyst presented superior activity and good stability toward overall water splitting at a broad pH range (Figure 11G).
6.3 Metal–Air Batteries
Metal–air batteries as important energy storage devices possess extremely high theoretical energy densities.[206] Among all metal–air batteries, Zn–air battery demonstrates the promising potential due to the abundant zinc source and high safety with comparable energy density.[207] Zn–air battery generates and stores electricity through the redox reaction of anodic Zn and cathodic oxygen. However, its commercialization on a large-scale application is locked by the sluggish ORR during discharging and OER during charging process.[208] Therefore, to advance toward the development of commercial of Zn–air battery, efficient and robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are indispensable and strongly desired.
In recent years, graphitic layers encapsulated transition-metal-based materials have reported for Zn–air battery.[209] The full encapsulated transition-metal nanoparticles with ultrafine and high metal-loading exhibited superb OER and ORR activities and stabilities (Figure 12A–C).[210] Using this material as air electrode, an unprecedented cycle stability was achieved for the rechargeable Zn–air battery. In addition, MOFs derived carbon encapsulated metal structures also feature excellent bifunctional activities and show great promising for Zn–air battery.[211] For example, MOFs derived N-doped carbon nanotube in the hollow frameworks form exhibited higher OER and ORR activities and stabilities than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, which were mainly attributed to the unique chemical compositions and robust architecture.[212] With the introduction graphene, the surface area of the N-doped carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrid was significantly increased, thus leading to the enriched active sites and superior Zn–air battery performance (Figure 12D–F).[213] Indeed, the large surface area and enriched accessible active sites are key factors for the electrocatalysts to deliver good battery performance, which can be addressed by creating porous structure. For example, using silica as template, the interconnected macroporous carbon matrix was developed with interconnected porous structure and enriched accessible Co–N–C active sites (Figure 12G,H), which delivered excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR (Figure 12I) and OER (Figure 12J).[214] The oxygen electrocatalytic activity and Zn–air battery performance could be further enhanced by constructing continuous nanocarbon network, in which the electrocatalyst with interconnected N-doped carbon nanotubes possessed abundant Co–N/C sites and robust architecture (Figure 12K–N).[215] The Co–N/C sites facilitated the adsorption of oxygen reaction intermediates, while the open and porous architecture ensured the efficient access and release of oxygen molecules. Benefiting from these features, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance in Zn–air battery (Figure 12O,P) and remarkable stability with a negligible voltage fading during the 1600 h of charge/discharge process (4800 cycles; Figure 12Q).

7 Perspective and Outlook
Exploring high efficient and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts is always significant for several energy conversion and storage technologies. Numerous strategies have been adopted to construct advanced oxygen electrocatalysts. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the fundamental aspects of oxygen electrochemistry, the structure–activity–performance relationship of oxygen electrocatalyst are discussed in the rational design approaches of the three types of catalysts including noble metal, transition metal, and carbon materials. Subsequently, oxygen electrocatalysts in related energy conversion and storage technologies are discussed in fuel cells, water electrolyzer, and metal–air batteries (Scheme 2). Numerous achievements have been realized on the efficient electrocatalyst for several electrochemical energy technologies, but more innovations are still required to meet the increasing energy demand and environment pressure. Particularly, some perspectives are proposed below for future development of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts toward energy conversion and storage technologies.

Perspectives related to oxygen electrocatalysts for their potential energy technologies.
The first is always developing novel efficient and robust oxygen electrocatalysts, sometimes with special functionality like pH universal, as it is the key to realize the efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. The significant lower oxygen adsorption binding energy in acidic than that in alkaline media illustrates that developing efficient ORR catalysts in acidic media is much more challenging. In addition, most transition-metal-based catalysts show competitive activity compared to noble-metal-based counterpart, nevertheless, they often suffer the serious dissolution in acidic environment. Therefore, developing efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysts are imperative for their practical applications. Exploring stable potential windows for OER/ORR electrocatalysts can be adopted to keep the electrocatalytic activity and simultaneously suppress deactivation pathways. In addition, the incorporation of heteroatoms or introduction of an appropriate carbon support material are useful strategies to stabilize the reaction termination in acidic media, which can apply the surface engineering to develop high active and stable transition-metal-based catalysts operated in acidic media.
The second insight would be improving the intrinsic activity beyond the scaling relation. Many non-noble-metal-based catalysts present more competitive catalytic activity than noble ones. Nevertheless, the inherent scaling relation of oxygen-containing intermediates still require them to have a minimum theoretical overpotential (0.3–0.4 V). Therefore, breaking the adsorption-energy scaling relations is an effective strategy to design superior ORR/OER catalysts. Some strategies including substitution with foreign elements and regulation of the vacancies and strain can be adopted to stabilize the reaction intermediate and optimize the adsorption energies of various intermediates. Furthermore, DFT calculation can be powerful to obtain the adsorption information. With the assistance of theoretical calculations and popular big data, understanding and beyond the scaling relation would be more hopeful.
Except the electrocatalysts, the third one would be developing practical synthetic and performance evaluation methods. In general, innovative synthetic pathways can create well-designed structures (such as hierarchical porous and ultrathin nanosheets) and expose more catalytically active sites (such as oxygen vacancy, edge sites, and intrinsic defects), which are significant for the boosted electrocatalytic activity with optimized adsorption properties. Therefore, high-precision synthetic methods should be developed to produce effective oxygen electrocatalysts with homogeneous and easily detected active sites. Meanwhile, these synthetic approaches of oxygen electrocatalysts, with environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and scale-up, should also be considered for the commercial application in sustainable energy conversion devices. Furthermore, the effective performance evaluation methods of oxygen electrocatalysts are essential for their practical application. It is generally known fuel cells consists the important component of membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is an effective performance evaluation indicator for practical fuel cell. Nevertheless, numerous works have devoted to evaluate the ORR activity at the rotating disk electrode level, and few results reported the ORR electrocatalysts on the MEA tests. In addition, the cost and durability especially in acidic media of ORR electrocatalysts are key issues for the commercial of fuel cell. Therefore, the superior ORR electrocatalysts with low cost and high durability at the MEA level are vital for the application of fuel cell in the marketplace. In the case of metal–air batteries, developing anode to match the advanced oxygen electrode is also of great importance for the stable operation in the full life cycle of whole battery system. For the industrial standard of water electrolyzer, developing bifunctional HER and OER catalysts is vital to the practical application of water-splitting electrolyzer, which can lower the manufacturing costs and simplify the overall water-splitting electrolyzer design. Furthermore, unstable and kinetically sluggish OER when the current density exceeds 0.5 A cm−2 are crucial issues limit the practical large-scale application of water-splitting electrolyzer. Therefore, developing water-splitting electrocatalysts with superior activity, good stability, and low cost at large current densities are essential for the commercial water electrolyzer. The rigorous requirement of electron and mass transfer efficiency can be improved by rationally designing the morphology and architecture of the whole catalytic electrode, which can optimize the reaction kinetics and keep mechanical stability.
The forth one would be developing advanced techniques for operando observations. Since the important descriptor of eg occupancy is closely correlated to the ORR/OER activity, the estimated methods are usually adopted by ex situ measurements or DFT calculations. Developing advanced operando techniques is vital to accurately measure the eg occupancy of ORR/OER electrocatalysts. In addition, the surface structure of oxygen electrocatalysts seems to change under oxygen catalytic process. However, the competition reaction mechanisms on the surface of metal and oxygen are not clear. Furthermore, the changed structure related to phase transformations, valence state, and morphological variations of oxygen electrocatalysts cannot be captured under OER/ORR conditions. In these regards, advanced characterization techniques including near-atmospheric X-ray photoelectron spectra, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform, and near-atmospheric scanning tunneling microscopy can be introduced to capture the catalyst evolution and reaction intermediates for better understanding the catalytic reaction mechanism during the process. Particularly, these operando techniques are also required at the device level as the oxygen electrochemical reactions happening in the energy technologies are more complicated due to more requirements in electrolyte, reagents, voltages, and catalysts themselves. Finally, advanced oxygen electrocatalysts determine their efficiency and cost for the energy storage and conversion technologies. With continuous innovations and deep understandings in the oxygen electrocatalysis, these sustainable energy technologies can power human society more close to a bright future.
