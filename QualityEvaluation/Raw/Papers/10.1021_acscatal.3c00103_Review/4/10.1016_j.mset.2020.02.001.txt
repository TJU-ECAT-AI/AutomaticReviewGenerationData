Abstract
Alumina nano-particles have wide usage in the adsorption and catalysis fields, because of its acid-base properties, high specific area, mechanical and thermal stability. The first part of the review interested on the various processes for the production of nano-particles alumina. The second part outlines the functionalization of nano-particles alumina with different function groups. Finally, the wide applications of nano-particles alumina in different fields are reported. Utilization of nano-particles alumina described in various industrial processes are evaluated from the standpoint of the importance of these reactions for technological applications, as reported in the literature.
