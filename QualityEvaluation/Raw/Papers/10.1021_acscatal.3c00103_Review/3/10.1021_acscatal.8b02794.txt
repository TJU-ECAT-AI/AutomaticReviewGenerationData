Abstract
The development of on-purpose 1,3-butadiene (BDE) technologies remains an active area in catalysis research, because of the importance of BDE in industrial polymer production. Here, we report on a nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalyst for the production of BDE prepared by atomically precise installation of platinum sites on a Zn-modified SiO2 support via atomic layer deposition (ALD). In situ reduction X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO chemisorption, and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging of activated PtZn/SiO2, revealed the formation of a uniform, well-distributed subnanometer- to nanometer-sized PtZn (1.2 ± 0.3 nm) alloy as the active catalytic species.

The accessibility of practical and efficient technologies for the direct conversion of n-butane to 1,3-butadiene (BDE) remains a grand challenge in catalysis science. (1) BDE, which is a primary building block of synthetic rubber (2) and a wide range of polymer products, (3) is mainly produced by cryogenic distillation of C4 fractions from naphtha cracking, (4) or catalytic dimerization of ethanol. (5) The recent emergence of lighter feedstocks (e.g., shale gas) has created a technology shift focused on upgrading lighter hydrocarbons, which negatively impacts yields of C4 fractions, ultimately raising barriers to the sustainable cracking-based BDE production. Catalytic dehydrogenation of C4 hydrocarbons (e.g., n-butane, butenes) to BDE, both oxidative (6,7) and nonoxidative, (8) have long been investigated as on-purpose BDE technologies. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons, which is an equilibrium-limited endothermic reaction, requires higher-temperature conditions (550–700 °C) to achieve practical conversions. (8) These elevated temperatures also promote a range of side reactions, which include (1) C–C bond scission via hydrogenolysis or cracking, giving C1–C3 products, (2) isomerization, forming branched hydrocarbons, and (3) over dehydrogenation that leads to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. (8)
Catalysts selective to BDE via nonoxidative dehydrogenation on n-butane remain inaccessible; (9−15) even the most extensively studied Pt catalysts (e.g., PtySnx/Al2O3), (8) are mainly selective to butenes. However, the breadth of fundamental knowledge on Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation provides insights into the ideal attributes of robust, high-performance catalysts for direct conversion of n-butane to BDE. It has been established that dehydrogenation is insensitive to the structure of Pt, (8) suggesting that all surface-accessible Pt atoms facilitate the reaction. On the other hand, cracking, isomerization and coke deposition are structure-sensitive reactions. (16,17) Acid sites and hydrogenolysis-active Pt sites in nanoparticles are proposed to be responsible for C–C bond scission, while highly coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites in bulk assemblies promote excessive dehydrogenation to coke deposits. Thus, effective engineering of catalysts by (1) ensuring high Pt dispersity and (2) enabling the suppression of surface sites responsible for C–C scission and coking are key to the development of on-purpose BDE catalyst technologies. The ability to tune the electronic properties of Pt is also critical for imparting high BDE selectivity. Optimal catalytic sites should (1) bind strong enough with C4 substrates, butane and butenes, to facilitate dehydrogenation to BDE, but (2) the Pt–BDE interaction should be labile enough to facilitate product desorption and prevent further reactivity.
In this report, we describe the development of atomically precise surface-supported Pt-alloy catalysts for deep dehydrogenation of n-butane to BDE under nonoxidative conditions. Specifically, high-surface-area silica (SiO2) was equipped with a submonolayer of Zn2+ anchoring sites via atomic layer deposition (ALD); these cationic zinc sites were shown to stabilize and influence the reactivity of Pt, giving rise to a subnanometer PtZn/SiO2 catalyst with unprecedented activity, BDE yields, and stability under practical conditions. The ability of PtZn alloys (18) or other catalytic PtZn phases (19) to selectively dehydrogenate hydrocarbons has been reported in the literature. (20) These include (i) stable PtZn spinels on oxide supports, (21) and (ii) PtZn nanoalloys on SiO2 (∼9 wt % Pt, 2.5 ± 0.6 nm). (22) It has been proposed that zinc increases the electron denstity at the platinum sites in PtZn alloys, (23) weakening Pt–olefin binding and facilitating olefin desorption and faster dehydrogenation rates. (24)
Highly dispersed organoplatinum sites were deposited onto high-surface-area Zn(II)-modified SiO2 (25,26) (10 wt % Zn) at 90 °C via one-cycle ALD, (27) employing [(MeCp)PtMe3] (28) as the metal precursor ((MeCp)PtMex/Zn/SiO2; Scheme 1). The sample was then reduced at 550 °C for 2 h under flowing hydrogen to yield the 0.5 wt % PtZn/SiO2 (1). (29) The same synthetic procedure was used for the deposition of platinum on SiO2 (2; 0.5 wt %). (30,31) In situ Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reduction experiments on the as-deposited organoplatinum precursor on Zn/SiO2 ((MeCp)PtMex/Zn/SiO2; Figure 1) shows the complete reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0 and the detection of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features attributable to Pt–Zn (2.57 ± 0.02 Å) and Pt–Pt (2.66 ± 0.02 Å) (see Table S1 for fitting and Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information), with a Pt–Zn vs Pt–Pt ratio of 15–85, suggesting the formation of a Pt-rich PtZn alloy. Note also a shift of ∼0.2 eV in the Pt-L3 edge (Figure S1) is observed from 1 to 2, supporting the possible formation of a PtZn alloy. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed a significant shift of ∼0.3 eV (1 = 71.3 eV) in the Pt 4f7/2 electron binding energy from 2 (71.0 eV), further corroborating the formation of an alloyed structure with zinc (see Figures S4–S6 in the Supporting Information). (32−34) Also note that the binding energy of nanocluster 1 (71.3 eV) is very similar to the binding energy of PtZn alloy nanocluster encapsulated in zeolites (71.4 eV). (32) The particle sizes of species 1 and 2 were investigated using the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging technique and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping. The STEM images of 1 showed homogeneously dispersed Pt particles (bright dots) with an averaged PtZn particle size of 1.2 ± 0.3 nm (see Figure 2).

Furthermore, EDS mapping confirmed that Pt and Zn are homogeneously dispersed in these particles (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Several studies have reported nanometer/subnanometer monometallic and bimetallic particles synthesized by ALD (29,35,36) and surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). (37,38)
CO adsorption (2100–1950 cm–1 region; linearly bonded CO on Pt atom) was used to determine the effect of zinc on the electronic structure of the platinum phase. The presence of Zn in 1 results in a red-shift of ∼9 cm–1 of the CO stretching frequency, compared to 2 (from 2072 cm–1 to 2063 cm–1; Figure S10), likely due to an increased electron density of surface Pt metal, which further suggests the formation of a PtZn alloy phase. (24)
Catalysts 1, 2, and PtSn/Al2O3 were tested for the nonoxidative n-butane dehydrogenation reaction, employing a 16-parallel-reactor Flowrence system. Initially, nonoxidative n-butane (1% n-butane/Ar feed) dehydrogenation was performed under differential conditions. Catalysts were investigated under varied reaction conditions, including temperature (from 450 °C to 600 °C; Figure S11 in the Supporting Information), time on stream (up to 90 h to monitor catalyst stability), and H2 cofeed (1:1 H2/n-butane; see Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Optimal catalytic performance was observed between 500 °C and 550 °C, while aggressive deactivation occurred at higher temperatures (≥600 °C). Co-feeding with H2 was detrimental to BDE selectivity, while catalyst preactivation with a 10% H2/Ar feed at 550 °C for 2 h resulted in higher activity (see Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). Optimal reaction parameters (preactivation with H2 at 550 °C, catalyst loading of 100 mg, dehydrogenation temperature at 500 °C, identified from the high-throughput screening; see Table 1) were employed in all individual fixed-bed microreactor experiments with a 5% n-butane/Ar feed, employing an average gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 2800 h–1. Catalyst 1 outperforms 2 and PtSn/Al2O3, with initial specific activities for C4 olefins of 1.8 × 10–1, 3.3 × 10–2, and 6.8 × 10–2 s–1, respectively. Note the calculated n-butane equilibrium conversion at 503 °C is 83.8% (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). (39) Under identical conditions, the Zn/SiO2 (26) support afforded significantly lower n-butane conversion to butenes (∼99% selectivity), confirming that the dehydrogenation activity of 1 is mainly due to Pt. Note also that PtZn nanoparticles on γ-Al2O3 exhibit negligible activity under these reaction conditions (Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). All three catalysts gave trace quantities (<1% selectivity) of C1–C3 hydrocarbons from cracking and C–C bond isomerization products (e.g., i-butane, i-butene), with a carbon balance of 96%–99% at 20 h (see Figure S15 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information; the remaining 1%–4% is attributed to coke deposition, vide infra). This suggests that the dispersed Lewis acidic zinc sites are partially suppressing the Brønsted acidic silanols, which are responsible for the C–C bond activation. In addition, the catalysts showed high total C4 olefin selectivity (butenes + BDE) over long periods (20 h): 1 (92.5%–99.0%), 2 (88.5%–77.4%), and PtSn/Al2O3 (96.4%–98.8%). It is noteworthy that, with great disparity in n-butane conversions (see Figure S14), direct comparison of BDE selectivities can be misleading. Hence, BDE yield was used as the main criterion for comparison of catalytic performance (see Figure 3).

BDE yields employing different Pt catalysts at 500 °C using 5% n-butane/Ar (20 mL/min; GHSVaverage = 2800 h–1). 1, (PtZn)[52]ALD; 2, PtALD; 3, (PtZn)[16]ALD; 4, (PtZn)[120]ALD; 5, (PtZn)[69]IWI; PtSn/Al2O3, (PtSn)IWI. The number given in the superscripted square brackets represents the [Zn]/[Pt] molar ratio.
Catalyst 1 gave the highest BDE yields at 9.7%–9.1%, while 2 afforded lower yields at 6.4%–2.4%. Furthermore, catalyst 1 also showed higher stability (deactivation constant, Kd8 = 0.06 h–1; see Figure S14), based on 20 h deactivation rates, than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst (Kd = 0.13 h–1; see Figure S14). Also note that, under the same conditions, the PtZn/SiO2 catalytst (5; 0.4 wt % Pt/8.8 wt % Zn), prepared using the conventional incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) methodology (particle size = 2.8 ± 2.0 nm; see Figure S9 in the Supporting Information), (40) exhibits catalytic performances inferior to 1. The superior performance and stability of 1 could be attributed to the subnanometer size of the PtZn alloy nanoclusters, which strongly bind 1-butene than larger PtZn nanoparticles (e.g., PtZn(111); see preliminary calculation in the Supporting Information), high Pt dispersion, and lower Pt surface mobility. (41) These ideal precatalyst features can be enforced using ALD (42,43) or SOMC and are challenging to achieve via traditional synthesis techniques (e.g., IWI) that result in a wider distribution of sites.
The long-term stability of the most active catalyst 1 was evaluated over 7 days (see Figure S18 in the Supporting Information). An ∼60% deactivation from the initial 80% conversion occurred, with BDE selectivity increasing over time (from 10% to 22%). Characterization of spent 1 via HAADF-STEM (Figure S19 in the Supporting Information) and UV-Raman spectroscopy revealed carbon deposition based on the vibration at 1600 cm–1 (Figure S20 in the Supporting Information), confirming that the deactivation is mostly due to coking. (44) Oxidation of spent catalyst 1 with a 1% O2/Ar feed at 500 °C for 2 h to remove coke deposits gives rise to a catalyst with a slight decrease in initial activity, compared to the as-prepared catalyst, likely due to particle sintering from 1.2 ± 0.3 nm to 1.9 ± 1.5 nm (see Figure S19b). (45)
The effect of Zn loading on the ALD-synthesized catalysts was also investigated (see Figure 3, as well as Figure S14). Lowering the Zn loading from 10% (1; [Zn]/[Pt] = 52) to 5% (3; [Zn]/[Pt] = 16) while keeping the Pt loading at 0.5%, resulted in comparable specific activity for BDE, 2.3 × 10–2 vs 2.1 × 10–2 s–1. Keeping the Zn loading at 2.5% but lowering the Pt loading by a factor of ∼10 (4: [Zn]/[Pt] = 120) resulted in comparable BDE yields (3 at 8%; 4 at 7%). Comparison of the specific activity for BDE of 3 and 4 revealed that higher [Zn]/[Pt] ratios favor dehydrogenation activity on a per Pt basis (3 at 2.1 × 10–2 s–1 vs 4 at 1.3 × 10–1 s–1), which is a benefit of high Pt dispersion. In addition, the higher [Zn]/[Pt] ratio is presumably responsible for the enhanced stability of 4 (Kd = 0.03 h–1) compared to 3 (Kd = 0.05 h–1). These observations are consistent with a report by Iglesia (46,47) on how transition-metal anchoring sites can stabilize Pt catalysts (e.g., Pt/Fe-ZSM-5) for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
In summary, we have successfully synthesized uniform, well-distributed subnanometer/nanometer PtZn alloy particles on mesoporous silica via atomic layer deposition. The smaller PtZn/SiO2 nanoparticles, along with the positive promoter effect of zinc, show better selectivity toward the bis-dehydrogenated product BDE and higher specific activity than PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and larger Pt and PtZn nanoparticles. DFT calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results. This catalyst preparation strategy represents a promising design principle for the rational development of new classes of multimetallic selective dehydrogenation catalysts. Further studies are ongoing to explore and demonstrate the generality of this catalyst design strategy and synthetic approach.
