Abstract
A series of 2–3 nm Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles with different Pt–Sn coordination numbers were synthesized by a stepwise approach including electrostatic adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction of metal precursors on the SiO2 support. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) demonstrated a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic shell on Pt nanoparticles. The turnover rates (TORs), propylene selectivity, and stability of these bimetallic catalysts significantly surpass those of the monometallic Pt catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. At the same time, TORs increase with increasing the Pt–Sn coordination number, whereas propylene selectivity is not significantly influenced by the Pt–Sn coordination number. Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, the high propylene selectivity of Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles is attributed to the geometric effects of Sn that reduce the Pt ensembles, and the high TORs are due to the electronic effects that weaken Pt–hydrocarbon chemisorption energies.

1. Introduction
Nanoalloys have attracted great attentions in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high ratio of surface atoms and potential for improving catalytic performance by modifying the geometric and electronic structure of active metals. (1−5) Typically, alloys are classified into two categories according to the atomic order: solid solutions and intermetallic compounds. (6) Solid solutions often contain metals of similar atomic size and electronic character identical to that of the parent metal with random atomic arrangements. By contrast, intermetallic compounds possess a uniform crystal structure and highly ordered atomic arrangements. In several cases, nanoparticles include two phases with an intermetallic shell on a pure phase noble metal core. (7−9) It is challenging to precisely identify the structure of nanoalloys with small particle sizes, especially under realistic reaction conditions. (10)
With the surge of shale gas, light alkane dehydrogenation becomes increasingly important to synthesize olefins. (11) Pt catalysts are the most widely applied materials for light alkane dehydrogenation. (12) Compared with monometallic Pt, bimetallic nanoalloys, such as Pt–Sn, Pt–Zn, Pt–In, Pt–Ga, Pt–Cu, and Pt–Sb, exhibit improved catalytic performance with Pt–Sn alloys being the most successful example. (13−20) Both geometric and electronic effects have been suggested to explain the improved catalytic performance. Geometric effects in Pt–Sn alloys, for example, reduce the Pt ensemble size, decrease the hydrogenolysis rate, and increase olefin selectivity. (21,22) Electronic effects are thought to weaken adsorbate bond energies, enhance desorption of surface-bounded olefin, and limit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in higher olefin selectivity, reaction rates, and improved lifetime. (12,23) However, due to the challenges of characterizing and controlling the catalytic surface structure, the intrinsic contribution of Sn on Pt for light alkane dehydrogenation is still under debate.
Herein, we synthesized a series of SiO2-supported Pt@Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles with a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic shell (structure type NiAs) on Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. The structure of the surface Pt1Sn1 is stable at 550 °C, and the Pt–Sn coordination number is controllable by varying Sn loadings. The turnover rates (TORs), propylene selectivity, and stability of these bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation significantly surpass those of the monometallic Pt. At the same time, TORs increase with increasing Pt–Sn coordination number, whereas propylene selectivity is not significantly influenced by the Pt–Sn coordination number. Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, we suggest that the high propylene selectivity of the Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles is attributed to the geometric effects of Sn that reduce the Pt ensembles, and the high TORs are due to the electronic effects that weaken Pt–hydrocarbon chemisorption energies.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Synthesis of Catalysts
The Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts of a target Pt loading of 2 wt % were synthesized with different Sn loadings. Various amounts of SnCl4 were dissolved in 4.0 mL of methanol and added dropwise to 5.3 g silica. The obtained Sn/SiO2 was dried overnight at 125 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 3 h. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (0.21 g) was dissolved in 3.5 mL of water, and ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the solution until the pH reached 11. The solution was added dropwise to the obtained Sn/SiO2. This catalyst was then dried overnight at 125 °C and calcined at 225 °C for 3 h. Finally, the catalyst was reduced in 5% H2/N2 (150 mL/min) at 150° for 10 min, 200° for 30 min, 250° for 10 min, and 550° for 30 min. The sample is named as xSnPt/SiO2, where x denotes the mass loading of Sn. For comparison, Sn/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts with 2 wt % Pt/Sn loading were also prepared using the same method.
2.2. Characterization
Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) experiments for determining particle size were conducted using the FEI Titan scanning transmission electron microscope (80–300 kV, 1 nm spatial resolution) with a high angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detector at 300 kV at Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University. The particle size distribution was determined by counting 200 particles for each sample using Nano Measurer 1.2. The in situ synchrotron XRD experiment was performed at the 11-ID-C beamline at the APS, Argonne National Lab. Diffraction data was acquired in the transmission mode with a PerkinElmer large area detector using X-rays at 105.715 keV (λ = 0.11730 Å). X-ray absorption measurements with a transmission mode were acquired on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Pt dispersion was determined by CO chemisorption using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 chemisorption equipment. Pt dispersion was calculated by assuming a stoichiometry of CO:Pt = 1.
2.3. Catalytic Testing
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor with an internal diameter of 9.5 mm. The reaction temperature was monitored by an internal thermocouple placed at the center of the catalyst bed. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). Before each test, the catalyst was reduced at 550 °C for 30 min with 5% H2/N2 (50 mL/min). The reaction temperature was 500 °C, and the reactants were 2% C3H8, 3% H2, and balanced N2. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was adjusted to determine the selectivity at certain conversions. The turnover rates (TORs) were calculated from the moles of propylene produced per surface Pt site determined by Pt dispersions. For the stability test, the weight of samples was fixed at 0.02 g, and the flow rates were 150 mL/min.
2.4. Theoretical Calculations
All calculations have been performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) implemented by the Dmol3 program package in Materials Studio; exchange–correlation effects are described with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid is used for the integrations of the Brillouin zone. The double-numerical basis set with a polarization d-function (DNP) is chosen to expand the valence electron functions. We used Pt(111) (the most stable low exponential surface) to imitate the Pt nanoparticle; Pt(111) was modeled by a p(3 × 3) super cell with four layers, and the top three layers containing an adsorbate are relaxed. Pt1Sn1(110) means Pt1Sn1 full-body intermetallic, and Pt1Sn1(110) was modeled by a p(2 × 2) super cell and contained three layers, in which the top two layers are allowed to relax. Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111) was considered a Pt1Sn1 shell on top of Pt with a single layer of Pt1Sn1. The vacuum region was set 15 Å to avoid interperiodic interaction. Surface energy is determined by γ = (Eslab – NEbulk)/2A, where Eslab and Ebulk are the total energies of the slab and one bulk unit cell, respectively, N is the number of bulk units in the slab, and A is the surface area of the slab. The adsorption energy of surface species is defined as Eads = Eadsorbate/slab – Eslab – Eadsorbate, where Eadsorbate/slab, Eadsorbate, and Eslab are the calculated total energies of a surface slab with the species, gaseous-phase molecule, and the clean surface, respectively.
3. Results and Discussion
The Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts with different Sn loadings were synthesized through a stepwise approach including electrostatic adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction of metal precursors on the SiO2 support. First, tin chloride and tetraamine platinum(II) nitrate were sequentially impregnated on SiO2. The tetraamine platinum(II) nitrate solution is sufficiently basified to adsorb [Pt(NH3)4]2+on the SiO2 surface, which induces strong electrostatic adsorption of positively charged [Pt(NH3)4]2+ to the deprotonated silica surface. (24) Then, the Pt–Sn/SiO2 precursors were reduced at around 200 °C to obtain metallic Pt, followed by reduction at a higher temperature to form a Pt–Sn bimetallic phase on the Pt surface. As shown in Figures 1 and S1, the average particle sizes of the Pt and Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts are around 2–3 nm. The uniform particle sizes of these samples result from the strong electrostatic adsorption of the Pt precursors to the support, which allows comparing their catalytic kinetics at the same particle sizes. In situ synchrotron XRD with a high energy (105.715 keV) was employed to determine the long-range-order structure of the catalysts. The synchrotron X-ray provides enough signal intensity and resolution to identify diffraction peaks of 2–3 nm nanoparticles, while the high energy leads to lower-angle diffraction peaks according to Bragg’s law (2d sin θ = nλ). (25) As displayed in Figure 2A, with background subtracted, the Pt/SiO2 catalyst shows four diffraction peaks at 2θ of 2.98, 3.43, 4.88, and 5.71°, corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) of face-centered cubic (FCC) Pt. At a low Sn loading, the diffraction spectrum of the 1SnPt/SiO2 sample is similar to that of Pt/SiO2. With increasing Sn loadings, new diffraction peaks at 2θ of 1.89 and 2.25° are observed in 4SnPt/SiO2 and 8SnPt/SiO2, respectively, which corresponds to a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic compound. XRD results confirm the formation of two phases of Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts, which are metallic Pt and Pt1Sn1 intermetallic compounds (structure type NiAs). Notably, even though the Sn loadings reach 8%, SnOx is not observed in XRD, which could be attributed to the well dispersion or lack of the long-range-order structure of SnOx.

In situ Pt L3 edge XAFS measurements were conducted to investigate the local structure of Pt. As shown in Figure 2B, the Pt L3 edge energy of Pt/SiO2 is 11 564 eV, which is identical to that of metallic Pt. The XANES energy shifts to a higher level with increasing Sn loadings, suggesting a higher energy level of unfilled Pt 5d states. The Fourier transform k2-weighted R-space EXAFS of a monometallic Pt catalyst shows three main peaks between 1.7 and 3.2 Å, and the peak positions and Fourier transform magnitudes continue to change with increasing Sn loading, indicating scattering from metallic Sn and changes in bond distance and coordination numbers (Figure 2C). Table 1 lists the R-space EXAFS fitting results (Figures S2 and S3 display the fitting spectra). The Pt–Pt coordination number of Pt/SiO2 is 9.4, indicating typical 2–3 nm Pt nanoparticles, which agrees with the STEM results. For 1SnPt/SiO2, the Pt–Sn coordination number is only 0.8, and there are excessive Pt–Pt bonds, suggesting a Pt-rich bimetallic nanoparticle, which leads to the similar XRD spectra between 1SnPt/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2. With increasing Sn loadings, the Pt–Sn coordination number continues to increase, suggesting a higher ratio of Pt1Sn1 in the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts. The Pt–Sn bond distance (2.73 Å) is close to the Pt–Pt bond distance (2.72 Å) in the typical Pt1Sn1 intermetallic (ISCD 42593). However, in our bimetallic samples, the Pt–Sn bond distance is significantly shorter than the Pt–Pt distance because the Pt–Pt bond distance results from the average distance of Pt–Pt in Pt1Sn1 and Pt–Pt in metallic Pt, while the Pt–Sn bond distance only results from Pt1Sn1. The Pt–Sn bond distance of our sample is shorter than that of bulk Pt1Sn1, which could be attributed to the microstrain between Pt and Pt1Sn1 that influences the Pt–Sn bond distance, as expected for a Pt@Pt1Sn1 core–shell structure.

aFittings were done using k2-weighted R-space EXAFS spectra with the k-range of 3.0–12.0 Å–1 and the R range of 1.7–3.2 Å. The amplitude reduction factor is 0.75 based on the fitting of Pt foil.
There are five Pt–Sn alloy phases in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) with different Pt–Sn compositions, including PtSn4, PtSn2, Pt2Sn3, Pt1Sn1, and Pt3Sn (as listed in Table S1). To exclude the possibility of other Pt–Sn phases in our samples, XRD simulations were conducted for these alloys. As shown in Figure S4, the XRD patterns of PtSn4, PtSn2, Pt2Sn3, and Pt1Sn1 do not match the diffraction peaks of the sample. Although the diffraction peaks of Pt3Sn are similar to those of Pt, the Pt–Sn bond distance of Pt3Sn (2.83 Å) is significantly longer than the Pt–Sn bond distance of the sample (2.67 Å from the EXAFS fitting results). Combined with the XRD and EXAFS results, it is concluded that the nanoparticles contain Pt1Sn1 and Pt phases. According to the phase diagram, we should obtain numerous types of Pt–Sn alloys by changing the Sn loadings if the structure of the nanoparticles is only controlled by thermodynamics. However, in our Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts, only the hexagonal Pt1Sn1 phase was identified in the nanoparticles, which means that the kinetic diffusion plays an important role to form the structure. (7) In the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts, PtOx on SiO2 was first reduced to metallic Pt nanoparticles, and then SnOx was reduced by hydrogen spilled over from Pt at a higher temperature to form surface hexagonal Pt1Sn1. The Pt–Sn coordination number increases with increasing Sn loadings, which means that the hexagonal Pt1Sn1 is not only one surface layer on Pt nanoparticles, instead, the shell thickness of Pt@Pt1Sn1 increases with increasing Sn loadings. Notably, the crystal structure of Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts can be transformed by different supports and preparing methods. (27,28) Vu et al. reported Al2O3-supported Pt–Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which suggested that both Pt3Sn1 and Pt1Sn1 phases were coexisted in the bimetallic catalysts. (27) Ramachandran et al. applied an atomic layer deposition method to synthesize Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles supported on SiO2, and their results suggested that the phase compositions of Pt3Sn, Pt1Sn1, and PtSn4 were controllable by changing the Pt/Sn atomic ratios. (28) To investigate the thermodynamic stability of the surface Pt1Sn1, XRD spectra of 550 °C and the room temperature of the samples were compared. As shown in Figure S5, aside from the peak shift caused by thermal-induced lattice expansion, the diffraction patterns of 550 °C were similar to those of the room temperature, indicating that the crystal structure was not destroyed at the high temperature, which plays a key role to determine the structure–function relationship.
These as-synthesized catalysts were further evaluated for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared with the Pt/SiO2 catalyst, the Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a negligible activity for propane dehydrogenation (Table S2). As shown in Figure 3A, the propylene selectivity of Pt/SiO2 is 64% at 8% propane conversion, but the selectivity decreases to 35% when the conversion increases to 27%. With the formation of surface Pt1Sn1, propylene selectivity is higher than 92% for all the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts at different Sn loadings even higher propane conversion, ca. 30%. Notably, the Pt–Sn coordination number of 1SnPt/SiO2 is only 0.8, and there are excessive Pt–Pt bonds, which means that there is only a small amount of Pt1Sn1 intermetallic in the 1SnPt/SiO2 sample. In this case, if 1SnPt/SiO2 is a simple mixture of Pt nanoparticles and Pt1Sn1 intermetallic, the propylene selectivity of 1SnPt/SiO2 should be very low. Due to the high propylene selectivity of 1SnPt/SiO2, we exclude the possibility of a simple mixture of Pt nanoparticles and Pt1Sn1 intermetallic, which further validates the proposed Pt@Pt1Sn1 core–shell structure. The Pt–Sn coordination number of Pt@Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles has a significant effect on the TORs. As shown in Figure 3B, the TOR of Pt/SiO2 is 0.4 s–1, and the TOR increases with increasing Pt–Sn coordination number. TOR reaches 1.7 s–1 for the 8Sn2Pt/SiO2 catalyst, which is 4.3 times higher than that of Pt/SiO2. We also investigated the stability of these catalysts. As displayed in Figure 3C, propane conversion drops very quickly for Pt/SiO2, which decreases from 16 to 8% within 80 min. By contrast, the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts exhibit a high stability for propane dehydrogenation. Notably, the Pt dispersion decreases at a higher Sn loading, which decreases from 31 to 4% when the Sn loading is 8% (Table S3). By oxidizing the surface of the reduced samples, the Fourier transform magnitudes of the Pt–O scattering path continue to decrease with increasing Sn loadings, which may result from the unalloyed Sn species that cover the surface Pt and reduce the Pt dispersion (Figure S6). Thus, it is of critical importance to balance TORs and Pt dispersion in the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts.

From the precisely identified structure of the catalysts, DFT calculations were used to study the adsorption energies of the hydrocarbon species involved in propane dehydrogenation over the Pt and Pt–Sn catalysts. The (111) facet of Pt and the (110) facet of Pt1Sn1 were selected for calculations due to their lowest surface energy. Due to the difference in Pt–Sn coordination number/shell thickness, a Pt1Sn1 shell on the top of Pt was considered as the core–shell nanoparticle has only one surface layer (Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111)), and a Pt1Sn1 full-body intermetallic was considered as the nanoparticle has more than one Pt1Sn1 surface layer (Tables S4, S5, Figures S7, S8). It has been suggested that CH3CH2CH2, CH3CHCH3, CH3CHCH2, and CH3CCH2 are key intermediates in propane dehydrogenation and the adsorption energies of these intermediates on Pt have a significant effect on the catalytic performance. (23,29) As shown in Figure 4A, compared with Pt(111), Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111) decreases the adsorption energies by 7.8, 7.8, 11.8, 2.9, and 35.2 for CH3CH2CH3, CH3CH2CH2, CH3CHCH3, CH3CHCH2, and CH3CCH2, respectively, whereas the adsorption energies are reduced by 7.8, 50.3, 67, 79.2, and 127.7 for CH3CH2CH3, CH3CH2CH2, CH3CHCH3, CH3CHCH2, and CH3CCH2, respectively, on Pt1Sn1(110). The adsorption energies of all of the investigated adsorbates on Pt1Sn1(110) are weaker than those on Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111), confirming that the Pt–Sn coordination number has an important impact on intermediate adsorption. The electronegativity of Pt is 2.28, while that of Sn is 1.96, which means Sn donates electrons to Pt in Pt1Sn1 intermetallic. In the Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111) model, each surface Pt bonds with three subsurface Pt, which deceases the electronic effects of surface Sn, while surface Pt atoms do not bond with subsurface Pt in the Pt1Sn1(110) model. Thus, in our DFT results, the differences in the adsorption energies between Pt(111) and Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111) are much smaller than those between Pt1Sn1(110)/Pt(111) and Pt1Sn1(110).

These experiments and theoretical calculations lead to an in-depth understanding of the structure–function relationship. The surface geometric structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles is almost the same (hexagonal Pt1Sn1), but the surface electronic structure of these nanoparticles is different, which leads to similar propylene selectivity and different TORs for propane dehydrogenation. The Pt1Sn1 phase reduces the Pt–Pt coordination number and Pt ensembles compared with the monometallic Pt catalyst. It has been suggested that Pt threefold hollow sites resulted from large Pt ensembles lead to the formation of alkylidyne species, which is responsible for hydrogenolysis. (30,31) The high propylene selectivity of these Pt–Sn catalysts results from the geometric effects of Sn on Pt that isolate the surface Pt atoms. As shown in Figure 4B, the electronic effects of Sn on Pt lead to a higher level of XANES energy, suggesting a higher level of unfilled Pt 5d states, which reduces the adsorption energies of hydrocarbons on Pt according to the DFT calculations. Since the reaction rates of light alkane dehydrogenation are desorption-limited, lower adsorption energies result in higher TORs of the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts. (12) Similar results have been reported in the Pt1Zn1 alloys. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and DFT results suggest that high TORs of the Pt1Zn1 alloys are due to the weakened bonds between Pt and alkenes resulted from the lower energy level of the occupied Pt 5d states and higher energy level of the unoccupied Pt 5d states. (32) Thus, in the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts, the high propylene selectivity is due to the geometric effects of Sn on Pt, and the high TORs result from the electronic effects of Sn on Pt.
Solid-supported Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts are one of the most important catalytic materials for light alkane dehydrogenation. Although Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation have been studied widely, the intrinsic contribution of Sn on Pt is still under debate. Precisely characterizing and controlling the structure are of critical importance to identify the structure–function relationship. Using regular XRD to determine the structure, many supports, such as Al2O3, SAPO-34, ZSM-5, and SBA-15, often produce strong diffraction peaks that cover the potential diffraction peaks of Pt or Pt–Sn alloys with small particle sizes. (33−36) For example, Liu et al. investigated the indium-modified Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation. (33) In the XRD patterns, only diffraction peaks of Al2O3 were observed, while the diffraction peaks of Pt, Sn, and In species were not detected. In this case, the atomic arrangement of the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts is still unknown. Another challenge for determining the structure of Pt–Sn alloys is that the structure of Pt3Sn intermetallic is similar to that of metallic Pt. Deng et al. synthesized a series of Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on amorphous SiO2 by a direct reduction method. They proposed that Pt3Sn was formed at a low Sn loading, while Pt1Sn1 was formed when the molar ratio of Sn to Pt reaches 3. (37) Vu et al. reported a Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst (3% Pt loading 3%, 3% Sn loading) for propane dehydrogenation, which achieved ∼48% propane conversion and ∼90% propylene selectivity at a reaction temperature of 600 °C. (27) They suggested both Pt3Sn and Pt1Sn1 were coexisted in the bimetallic catalysts. In our Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts, the surface Pt–Sn alloys maintain a hexagonal Pt1Sn1 structure with changing Sn loadings. Even though the XRD pattern of Pt3Sn is very similar to that of 1SnPt/SiO2, we exclude the possibility of Pt3Sn in our bimetallic samples by comparing the Pt–Sn bond distance of our samples and Pt3Sn intermetallic. Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, we reveal the geometric and electronic effects of Sn on Pt for propane dehydrogenations. This work highlights the importance of precisely characterizing and the controlling catalytic surface structure of small nanoalloys in heterogeneous catalysis.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of 2–3 nm Pt@Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles with a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic shell on Pt nanoparticles were identified by in situ synchrotron XRD and XAFS. Compared with the monometallic Pt catalyst, Pt–Sn bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher TORs, propylene selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation. At the same time, TORs increase with increasing Pt–Sn coordination number, whereas propylene selectivity is not significantly influenced by the Pt–Sn coordination number. The high propylene selectivity of the Pt–Sn alloys is attributed to the geometric effects of Sn that reduce the Pt ensembles, and the high TORs are due to the electronic effects that weaken Pt–hydrocarbon chemisorption energies. This work highlights the importance of precisely characterizing and controlling the catalytic surface structure of small nanoalloys in heterogeneous catalysis.
