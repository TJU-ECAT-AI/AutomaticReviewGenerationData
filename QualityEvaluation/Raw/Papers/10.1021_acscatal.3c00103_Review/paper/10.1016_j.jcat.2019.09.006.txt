Abstract
Zn-modified zeolites exhibit high activity for the aromatization of C2+ alkanes. To understand the effect of Zn-species of different nature on propane molecules activation and transformation, the H/D hydrogen exchange of zeolite Brønsted acid sites (BAS) with deuterated propane-d8 has been investigated. Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied. Zn-species of either type work jointly with BAS and may provide the synergy effect for propane CH bond activation resulting in dramatic acceleration of the H/D exchange between propane and BAS. The accelerating effect of isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced compared to zinc oxide clusters. Moreover, the H/D exchange occurs regioselectively into the methyl groups of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. For ZnO/H-BEA, the methylene group becomes also involved in the exchange after some induction period. Various mechanisms providing the regioselective H/D exchange on Zn2+/H-BEA as well as the involvement of the methylene group after the induction period on ZnO/H-BEA are discussed.

1. Introduction
The conversion of C2C4 alkanes represents a promising way to produce highly valuable aromatic hydrocarbons
[1]

[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
. Currently, Zn-modified zeolites are among the most effective catalysts to perform propane aromatization
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. Indeed, the catalysts, which are traditionally prepared by the ion exchange or impregnation of ZSM-5 zeolite (ammonia- or acid-form) with aqueous solution of zinc salts, have demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for aromatics as compared to the catalysts based on pure acid-form ZSM-5 zeolite
[5]
,
[10]
. On the other hand, the samples obtained by the mechanical mixing of zinc oxide and the acid-form zeolite were also found to exhibit satisfactory activity in the alkane conversion similar to that demonstrated by the ion exchanged or impregnated zeolites
[5]
,
[7]
.
The studies of the composition and the state of zinc introduced into the zeolites by the ion exchange methods have shown the presence of different Zn-species: isolated Zn2+ cations and zinc oxide particles of various dimensions and localization. The latter species were found in the form of small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores and large ZnO particles on outer surface of zeolite crystals

.
The method of Zn loading in the zeolites by the solid-state exchange reaction of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) with metallic zinc vapor was also proposed
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. Such approach leads to isolated Zn2+ cations to be the main state of zinc inside the zeolite pores
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
. ZSM-5 zeolite containing only Zn2+ cations and BAS was shown to activate small alkanes, including methane
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
. Zn-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing only zinc oxide ZnmOn clusters and BAS also showed an enhanced catalytic activity in propane conversion towards the aromatics
[33]
.
The studies of C1C3 alkane activation and conversion on acid-form BEA and ZSM-5 zeolites, loaded with both zinc oxide species and isolated Zn2+ cations, assumed the importance of the former Zn-sites, however, possible influence of latter ones cannot be excluded
[19]
,
[20]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
. Recent examination of ZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc using different approaches (ion exchange, impregnation, solid-state exchange with zinc vapor, and chemical vapor deposition of dimethylzinc) demonstrated that the samples having heterogeneous distribution of extra-framework zinc species (zinc oxide clusters and oxygenated cationic Zn-complexes) were more active than the samples with isolated Zn2+ sites
[39]
. Hence, these studies evidence that Zn-species of various structure and composition can provide efficient aromatization of C2C4 alkanes.
Numerous investigations have been focused on establishing the mechanism of propane activation and transformations on Zn- and Ga-modified zeolite catalysts with the aim of finding the ways to enhance aromatization efficiency on these catalysts
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[10]
,
[12]
. Generally accepted reaction network of propane conversion includes the stages of initial propane dehydrogenation to form the olefin, the olefin dehydro-oligomerization and the cyclization to produce aromatic hydrocarbons
[4]
,
[6]
,
[12]
. Regioselectivity of H/D hydrogen exchange of propane with BAS and remarkable acceleration of hydrogen exchange were observed for Zn/H-ZSM-5
[34]
and Zn/H-BEA
[35]
zeolites as compared to pure acid-form zeolites
[40]
,
[41]
. That was an evidence for the synergy of Zn-sites and BAS for the activation of CH bonds of the methyl groups of propane molecule on these catalysts. The formation of propylene, coordinating to Zn-species, as the intermediate of propane aromatization was detected with NMR spectroscopy
[36]
,
[38]
. However, it is still unclear which particular species, either Zn2+ or ZnO, provides the synergy of Zn species and BAS for propane CH bond activation resulting to the regioselectivity of the exchange and initial propane dehydrogenation.
In this paper, two samples of H-BEA zeolite, containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA sample) or small ZnO clusters (ZnO/H-BEA sample), were prepared and examined in the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange of propane-d8 with BAS. Analysis of the kinetics, monitored with 1H MAS NMR in situ, has allowed us to clarify the role of Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters in propane activation on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Zeolite sample preparation
Parent BEA zeolite (Na-BEA) was synthesized according to previously described approach
[42]
. The acid form of the zeolite (H-BEA) was further obtained by Na-BEA sample treatment with ammonium nitrate aqueous solution followed by calcination at 823 K in air flow for 6 h. For H-BEA zeolite, Si/Al ratio and aluminum content were determined to be 23 and 1.57 wt%, respectively, according to chemical analysis data. Si/Al ratio of 22 was confirmed with 29Si MAS NMR method for this sample (
Fig. S1
). Approximately 6% of extra-framework aluminum was observed with 27Al MAS NMR method (
Fig. S1
).
2.2. Synthesis of Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite
Zinc was loaded into H-BEA zeolite in the form of isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) by the solid-state reaction as was described earlier
[43]
. Briefly, the procedure of Zn2+ sites formation included vacuum activation of H-BEA zeolite at 673 K (residual pressure <10–3 Pa) followed by the reaction with zinc vapor at 773 K. Amount of zinc was adjusted to obtain ∼30% substitution of bridged SiOHAl groups for Zn2+ cations (
Table 1
).
Table 1. Concentration of BAS in H-BEA, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolite samples.

ZnO/H-BEA 690 740 (ZnO)0.55 Al0.17oct H2.88 Al2.88 Si61.12 O128
Zn2+/H-BEA 700 530 Zn2+0.42 Al0.17oct H2.05 Al2.88 Si61.12 O128
2.3. Synthesis of ZnO/H-BEA zeolite
Parent Na-BEA zeolite was used to prepare ZnO-modified zeolite (ZnO/H-BEA). The approach of ZnO species loading inside the zeolite pores was described previously
[44]
. It is based on the adsorption inside the pores of dimethylzinc (DMZ) and its further hydrolysis which is followed by drying and calcination of the zeolite sample. Chemical analysis showed that zinc content in ZnO/H-BEA zeolite sample was 0.94 wt%. This procedure leads to the formation of small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores with the quantity of BAS being intact (
Table 1
). The latter means that no cationic species, Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+, are present in ZnO/H-BEA zeolite.
2.4. Materials used
Dimethylzinc (1.0 M heptane solution), propane-d8 (99% D), propane-1-13C (99% 13C) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company Inc. and used without further purification.
2.5. Zeolite samples characterization
The procedures to prepare Zn-modified zeolites Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA were similar to those ones previously utilized
[44]
, though the parent BEA zeolite was from a different batch. Compared to samples studied previously
[44]
, the parent zeolite had larger contents of non-framework aluminum, while similar characteristics in terms of the BAS concentration, the state of zinc, and distribution of zinc species were obtained. According to HRTEM (High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy) no large ZnO clusters or aggregates and bulk phase were formed suggesting that Zn-species are mostly located inside the zeolite pores for both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolite samples. EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) elemental mapping demonstrated that zinc atoms are uniformly distributed over the intracrystalline void for both zeolite samples (
Fig. S2
). EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) data confirmed isolated Zn2+ cations for Zn2+/H-BEA; no peaks from neighboring atoms typical for metallic zinc or zinc oxide
[44]
were present in the radial distribution function. 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to assess BAS quantity for H-BEA, Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites by using methane as internal standard
[45]
,
[46]
. It was estimated that ∼30% of SiOHAl groups were substituted for zinc cations during the solid-state reaction of BAS with zinc vapor. On the contrary, the 1H MAS NMR showed nearly the same content of SiOHAl groups as in unmodified zeolite for ZnO/H-BEA sample.
Table 1
gives BAS concentration and unit cell composition for the zeolites.
2.6. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy for in situ kinetic measurements and sample characterization
The method of in situ NMR spectroscopy is based on the use of sealed ampoules (3 or 5.5 mm diameter) made of axially high-symmetrical borosilicate (Pyrex) glass tubes. The tube perfectly fits into MAS NMR zirconia rotor of 4 or 7 mm diameter. For each experiment, an ampoule is filled with a zeolite sample (30 or 80 mg, depending on the diameter of the tube) and then connected to a vacuum line. Further, the activation of the zeolite sample at 673 K for 24 h under vacuum with a residual pressure of less than 10−3 Pa is performed. Propane (propane-d8 or propane-1-13C) is adsorbed on the zeolite (300 μmol g−1) under vacuum at the temperature of liquid nitrogen after the sample activation. At the final stage, the glass tube with the sample is sealed by mircotorch flame while keeping the ampoule in liquid nitrogen to prevent its heating.
A Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (9.4 T) equipped with broad-band double-resonance MAS probe was used to record NMR spectra. The glass ampoules inserted into zirconia rotors were spun at 3–5 kHz by dry compressed air.
The Hahn-echo pulse sequence π/2–τ–π–τ–acquisition, where τ is equal to one rotor period, was used for 1H MAS NMR spectra acquisition. The length of π/2 pulse was 5.0 μs and 24 or 32 scans were accumulated for a spectrum with a 4 or 60 s repetition delay. Prior to kinetic measurements, the NMR probe with the sample inside was preheated for 20 min at the temperature (usually, 373 K), which is not high enough to launch the H/D exchange of propane-d8 with BAS. Following the preheating, the temperature of the probe was raised within few minutes up to a target value, and, after the equilibration for 4–5 min, NMR spectra acquisition for kinetics measurements was started.
13C MAS NMR spectra with high-power proton decoupling and 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra with a combination of high-power proton decoupling and cross-polarization (CP) technique were recorded at room temperature. For the spectra recorded with CP technique, field strength of the proton high-power decoupling was 11.7 G (5.0 μs length of 90° 1H pulse), the contact time was 2 ms at Hartmann–Hahn matching condition of 50 kHz, the delay between scans was 2 s, and the total number of scans was 30000. 13C MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 1000 scans using a 10 s delay.
27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained with a short π/12 radio frequency pulse (0.6 μs), and about 10,000 scans were accumulated with a 0.5 s recycle delay. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a π/2 excitation pulse of 5.0 μs duration and 60 s repetition time, and 1000 scans were acquired for signal accumulation. Both 27Al and 29Si NMR spectra were recorded with the use of 4 mm rotors and a spinning rate of 10–15 kHz.
The chemical shift was referenced to TMS for 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectra and 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 solution for 27Al NMR spectra with an accuracy of ±0.5 ppm. The temperature of sample was controlled by a Bruker BVT-1000 variable-temperature unit. The temperature calibration of the sample in the probe was performed with an accuracy of ±1 K by using lead nitrate, located inside the rotor, as a 207Pb MAS NMR chemical shift thermometer
[47]
.
2.7. Kinetic modeling
Rate constants k for H/D hydrogen exchange reaction were determined according to the first order kinetic law by the least-squares one-exponential fit of the experimental kinetics. Additionally, the semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method
[48]
was applied for kinetic modeling of the experimental curves to estimate the rate constants on the basis of a suggested kinetic scheme.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Peculiarities of the H/D hydrogen exchange of propane with BAS on ZnO/H-BEA and Zn2+/H-BEA zeolites
H/D hydrogen exchange is an excellent test reaction to study the activation of alkane CH bonds by BAS of zeolites. Propane adsorbed on a zeolite exhibits two signals in 1H MAS NMR spectrum: at 1.0 ppm from the methyl (CH3) groups and at 1.5 ppm from the methylene (CH2) group
[49]
. Hence, it is possible to monitor the exchange reaction selectively for either the CH3 or CH2 groups by NMR in situ
[41]
. As the result, an important information on the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange of propane on a zeolite can be obtained and, therefore, the conclusions on the peculiarities of propane molecule activation by particular zeolite catalyst can be inferred

Here, the H/D exchange reaction was used to compare the performance of two Zn-modified zeolite samples in the activation of propane CH bonds. In this regard, the H/D exchange reaction between propane-d8 (CD3CD2CD3) and BAS of both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites was monitored by 1H MAS NMR in situ. We intend to clarify which Zn-species, either Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters, are involved in synergistic action with the zeolite BAS for propane molecule activation. The kinetics of the H/D exchange was analyzed at 413–483 K for both Zn-modified zeolite samples, while the temperature range of 548–563 K was used to study the exchange for pure acid-form H-BEA zeolite. It should be emphasized here that the H/D exchange represents the dominant route for propane transformation on Zn-modified zeolites within the temperature range used. 13C MAS NMR analysis of propane-1-13C conversion at 420–470 K has shown some products formed by dehydrogenation (propylene, Zn-allyl species) and cracking (ethane, methane). However, total propane conversion by these pathways was less than 5% at T < 470 K. (vide infra,
Fig. 5
).
Fig. 1
shows the stack plots of the 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded in situ at 423 K for propane-d8 adsorbed on ZnO/H-BEA and Zn2+/H-BEA zeolites. It could be seen for Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite that the intensity of the signal of the CH3 groups increases while that of the CH2 group does not remarkably change with the reaction time (
Fig. 1
a). This observation indicates a transfer of protium from BAS to the CD3 groups of propane, whereas the CD2 group seems to be not involved in the reaction. As opposed to Zn2+/H-BEA, the ZnO/H-BEA sample provides the H/D exchange for both groups in propane-d8 (
Fig. 1
b). Note however, that the growth of the intensity of the CH2 group is preceded by noticeable induction period (ca. 200 min in
Fig. 1
b). The kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange of propane-d8 with BAS for both zeolite samples, derived from the obtained 1H NMR data, are shown in
Fig. 2
,
Fig. 3
. Effective rate constants for hydrogen exchange were obtained on the basis of the first-order kinetic law. Note however, that the induction period for the estimation of the rate constant of the CH2 group (
) observed for ZnO/H-BEA zeolite was not taken into account. Only experimental points marked in red squares in
Fig. 3
was used for the rate constants estimation.

3.2. Preliminary analysis of the kinetics
Analysis of the experimental kinetics, assuming the first order kinetics law, shows that the apparent rate constant
is 26.1 × 10–4 min−1 and
is 1.5 × 10–4 min−1 (423 K) for Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. For ZnO/H-BEA zeolite,
= 9.5 × 10–4 min−1 (423 K) and, following 200 min of the induction period, the CH2 group becomes involved in the exchange with the rate constant
≈
. These data show the exchange is one order of magnitude faster for the CH3 groups than that for the CH2 group on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, i.e., the reaction occurs regioselectively into the methyl groups of propane-d8. Importantly, the rate constant of the exchange with the CH2 group is similar to that for pure acid-form zeolite
[40]
,
[41]
,
[49]
, which performs the exchange into both CH3 and CH2 propane groups with similar rate constants (see
Fig. 4
).

Arrhenius plot (
Fig. 4
) demonstrates the apparent activation energies of the exchange to be 85 kJ mol−1 for the CH3 groups and 104 kJ mol−1 for the CH2 group for Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. Notable difference in the activation energies and essentially higher values of the rate constant for the methyl groups point to a mechanism of the exchange for propane CH3 groups on Zn2+/H-BEA which should be distinct from that proposed for pure acid-form zeolites (H-BEA, H-ZSM-5). For H-from zeolites, the exchange occurs by the synchronous mechanism involving formation of carbonium ion transition state (pentacoordinated carbon atom) with hydrogen atoms exchanging at a halfway position between the carbon of the methyl or methylene group and the zeolitic oxygen atoms
[41]
,
[53]
.
For ZnO/H-BEA zeolite, only the methyl groups are involved in the exchange for the first 15–200 min of the reaction. This time interval represents an induction period on the kinetics curve of the CH2 group. Following the induction period, the CH2 group becomes involved in the exchange with the rate constant similar to that for the CH3 groups. However, the values of both rate constants are remarkably lower as compared to the constant measured for the CH3 groups on Zn2+/H-BEA. Apparent activation energies (94–98 kJ mol−1) are similar for both CH3 and CH2 groups, but higher than that for the exchange of the CH3 group with BAS on Zn2+/H-BEA (
Fig. 4
). All these findings can be accounted for by some specific mechanism of the H/D exchange of propane on ZnO/H-BEA, different from that on Zn2+/H-BEA.
3.3. Possible mechanisms of the H/D exchange of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite
The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange, accompanied by essentially higher rate compared to that for pure acid-form zeolite
[40]
,
[41]
,
[49]
, was earlier reported for propane on Zn/H-ZSM-5
[34]
and Zn/H-BEA
[35]
zeolites. Those zeolite samples contained both Zn2+ cations and ZnO species inside the zeolite void
[20]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. Therefore, it was impossible to infer which of two different Zn-species provided the regioselectivity of H/D hydrogen exchange reaction.
The described parameters of the exchange reaction for Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, containing Zn exclusively in the form of isolated Zn2+ cations, support the conclusion that Zn2+ cations are certainly responsible for the regioselectivity as well as the reaction acceleration. The peculiarities of the H/D exchange of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA could be further rationalized in terms of three possible mechanisms.
Mechanism I. The regioselectivity of the exchange could be accounted for by the involvement of propylene and isopropyl cation intermediates in the exchange as it was suggested earlier by Sommer and coworkers
[54]
,
[55]
for propane exchange reaction on Al2O3-promoted sulfated zirconia (
Scheme 1
, pathway a). In this scheme, propylene formed by propane-d8 dehydrogenation on Zn2+ cations is further protonated by SiOHAl group, in accordance to Markovnikov’s rule, offering the isopropyl cation with the protium label in the methyl group
[54]
,
[55]
. The cation abstracts deuterium from propane-d8 and gives deuterated propane selectively labeled with protium in the methyl group, regenerating isopropyl cation. This mechanism is initialized by the propylene followed by its protonation and isopropyl cation formation. For the realization of this mechanism, propylene formation and its protonation by BAS should occur at the temperature of the H/D exchange reaction performance, i.e., already at 413 K. The identification of propylene, formed from propane at 413–437 K, by 13C CP/MAS NMR (very low intensity signals at 20 ppm (CH3) and 110 ppm (=CH), see
Fig. 5
a) is in favor of this mechanism. However, the stage of propylene protonation to form isopropoxy intermediate (isopropyl cation stabilized by oxygen of the zeolite framework) has not been confirmed by our results. The formation of isopropoxy species (the signal at 87 ppm) has been detected only for ZnO/H-BEA zeolite (but not for Zn2+/H-BEA) at 473 K (vide infra,
Fig. 5
d).

Protium transfer from BAS of the zeolite to methylene group of propane-d8 via 1,2-hydride shift in isopropyl cation occurs by pathway b. The pathway b can be realized on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite.

Mechanism II. Another hypothesis, which can rationalize the observed regioselectivity of the H/D exchange, is based on the involvement of n-propylzinc species in the reaction. This surface intermediate was suggested to be formed at initial stage of propane conversion over Zn/H-ZSM-5 zeolite, which contained both Zn2+ cations and subnanomeric ZnO clusters
[19]
. The first step of this mechanism is reversible dissociative adsorption of propane by breaking CH bond of the methyl group on Zn2+ cation to give n-propylzinc species (Zn–CD2CD2CD3) and BAS (SiODAl). Further, reversible interaction of the other neighboring SiOHAl group with Zn–CD2CD2CD3 affords propane (CD2HCD2CD3) with protium label in the methyl group
[34]
,
[35]
(
Scheme 2
). This mechanism was earlier suggested for Zn/H-ZSM-5, containing both Zn2+ cations and subnanometric ZnO clusters
[34]
. However, which particular Zn species provided the regioselectivity was not clear. Obviously, the findings demonstrated in this work point out that Zn2+ cations certainly provide the regioselectivity.

Scheme 2. Regioselective H/D exchange between propane-d8 and BAS on Zn2+/H-BEA with the involvement of Zn-propyl species (mechanism II).
Similarly to mechanism I, mechanism II could provide the kinetic parameters of the exchange significantly different from those for pure acid-form zeolite
[40]
,
[41]
and also accounts for the involvement of only the methyl groups of propane in the exchange. Note however that Zn-propyl species, as intermediate providing the exchange by mechanism II on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, has not been detected in our experiments (
Fig. 5
), although its formation was claimed by Ivanova and coworkers
[19]
. Note also, that
Scheme 2
represents only a possible mechanism, accounting for regioselectivity of exchange with n-propyl species involvement, rather than strictly theoretically justified mechanism. The detailed analysis of Zn2+ cation stabilization by zeolite oxygens and disposition of Al atoms in the zeolite framework to provide regioselective H/D exchange of propane methyl groups with BAS may be a subject of further theoretical investigations.
Mechanism III. Mechanism II of the H/D exchange with the involvement of Zn-methyl species as intermediate was earlier proposed for methane-d4 on Zn/H-BEA
[20]
. In the case of mechanism II, the formation of Zn-methyl species is considered as a limiting stage for the H/D exchange reaction. However, the comparative analysis of the kinetics parameters for methane dissociative adsorption and methane-d4 H/D exchange on Zn2+/H-ZSM-5 zeolite has revealed that the latter process occurs one order of magnitude faster than the former one
[56]
. This means that Zn-methyl could not be the intermediate providing the H/D exchange reaction of methane on the zeolite. Therefore, the H/D exchange mechanism for methane was further rationalized
[44]
in terms of methane adsorption complex formation on Zn2+ cations at the first stage of the reaction
[30]
followed by the involvement of this transient complex in the exchange with BAS.
Presumably, similar mechanism (mechanism III), providing the regioselectivity of the exchange, can be realized for propane-d8 on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite. It includes the formation of an adsorption complex of propane methyl group with Zn2+ cation and subsequent exchange of this complex with BAS (
Scheme 3
). However, if such mechanism takes place, it is not clear why Zn2+ cations form the complex with the methyl group of propane but not with the methylene group. In the latter case, fast exchange of methylene group with BAS would be also observed. In this regard, further studies focusing on the possibility of specific adsorption of propane on Zn2+ cations via either CH3 or CH2 groups to give the corresponding molecular complexes are needed. Such research, however, is beyond the scope of current paper.

Scheme 3. Regioselective H/D exchange between propane-d8 and BAS on Zn2+/H-BEA with the involvement of transient molecular complex of Zn2+ cations and the methyl group of propane-d8 (mechanism III).
Currently, it is not possible to unambiguously conclude by which of the mechanisms, referred to as I, II or III, propane regioselectively exchanges on Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite with the rate essentially higher than that for pure acid-form zeolite. Nevertheless, we claim, based on our findings, that Zn2+ cations are definitely responsible for the acceleration of H/D exchange and its regioselectivity. These Zn2+ cations, being loaded into the zeolite, possibly form either some stable surface species, for instance n-propylzinc, or transient intermediate, plausibly some molecular complexes with propane. Both these options could potentially explain the regioselectivity and acceleration of the H/D hydrogen exchange.
3.4. Mechanism of the H/D exchange of propane on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. The role of ZnO species in the exchange
The analysis of the H/D exchange kinetics for propane-d8 on ZnO/H-BEA shows that the apparent rate constant
is slightly lower but of the same order of magnitude as
for Zn2+/H-BEA. This means that ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange reaction similar to Zn2+ cations. Interestingly, propane methylene group is not involved in the exchange for the first 15–200 min (the induction period) of the reaction, but only methyl groups are observed to exchange deuterons with BAS. Hence, the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA is also regioselective into propane methyl groups in the beginning of the kinetics. Similar values of the rate constants and the regioselectivity imply that the mechanism of the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA might be similar to that on Zn2+/H-BEA during the induction period. If this is the case, small ZnO cluster is also capable to provide the regioselectivity by the formation of the intermediates that could be formed from propane and Zn2+ cations on Zn2+/H-BEA.
Following the induction period, the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange with the apparent rate constant similar to that for the methyl groups,
≈
. This can be rationalized by the appearance of an additional stage in the reaction mechanism. This stage can be represented by fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the CH3 and the CH2 groups in propane (intramolecular H/D exchange). Interestingly, this process becomes initiated after some induction time.
Previously, an intramolecular H/D scrambling between methyl deuterons and methylene protons was detected for propane on Al2O3-promoted sulfated zirconia (SZA) catalyst at 300–370 K
[54]
,
[55]
and on H-ZSM-5 at T > 523 K
[40]
,
[41]
. The intramolecular H/D scrambling was accounted for by both vicinal hydride migration in the propyl cation formed from propane and skeletal rearrangement of protonated cyclopropane formed from the propyl cation. In order to realize same pathway on ZnO/H-BEA, the propyl cation should be formed under the conditions of the H/D exchange performance.
We have observed that the dehydrogenation of propane occurs to a small extent within the temperature range of the H/D exchange reaction
[36]
.
Fig. 5
shows 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-1-13C adsorbed on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites and heated for 1 h at 473–573 K. It is seen that the weak signals from the 13C-labeled groups at 20 ppm (CH3) and 110 ppm (CH2) of propylene coordinated to Zn-species are detected in the spectra (
Fig. 5
a,b)
[36]
,
[38]
. Also, the signals from Zn-allyl species are present at 93 ppm (ZnCH2) and 27 ppm (CH3)
[57]
. Further, prolong evacuation of the samples at room temperature results in the observation of only the signals of the coordinated propylene and Zn-allyl species for Zn2+/H-BEA (
Fig. 5
c). On the other hand, these signals are not detected for ZnO/H-BEA. Instead, the signals at 29 ppm (CH3) and 87 ppm (OCH) of isopropoxy intermediate
[58]
are clearly observed (
Fig. 5
d). The disappearance of the signal from BAS at 4.2 ppm in 1H MAS NMR spectrum of ZnO/H-BEA (
Fig. 5
h) and the retaining of this signal for Zn2+/H-BEA (
Fig. 5
g) under evacuation is also in favor of the propylene protonation by BAS and the formation of isopropoxy species on ZnO/H-BEA catalyst.
Based on these results, we conclude that the formation and accumulation of propylene occurs for both zeolite samples. For Zn2+/H-BEA, propylene is strongly held by Zn2+ cations and survives long time evacuation. For ZnO/H-BEA, the complex of propylene with zinc on ZnO cluster is presumably less stable under similar conditions of evacuation. The complex is destroyed and propylene migrates from ZnO cluster to BAS. Thus, propylene is protonated by BAS that results in a persistent isopropoxy intermediate.
We believe that the isopropoxy intermediate is in equilibrium with transient isopropyl cation
[58]
,
[59]
,
[60]
, the latter provides fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer via 1,2-hydride shift reaction or protium/deuterium scrambling in protonated cyclopropane
[55]
formed from isopropyl cation. Further, intermolecular hydride shift reaction of isopropyl cation with deuterated propane
[61]
leads to protium label transfer into the methylene group of propane. In this way, methylene CH2 group becomes involved in the H/D exchange following some induction period.
Note, there are two competing mechanisms for the intramolecular proton interchange: (1) the reversible 1,2-hydride shift in the isomeric adsorbed propylium ions (
Scheme 1
, pathway b); (2) via protonated cyclopropane (PCP) intermediate
[55]
. In the latter case, 13C-label scrambling, i.e. 13C atom transfer between the CH3 and CH2 groups, in propane should be observed at the temperature of the H/D exchange reaction
[40]
,
[41]
,
[55]
,
[62]
. However, notable 13C-label scrambling in propane-1-13C was detected only at the temperature as high as 473 K, when the signal at 16.5 ppm from propane-2-13C appeared in the spectrum. On the other hand, the H/D exchange was monitored already at 423–483 K. This evidently supports that fast intramolecular H/D exchange (H-scrambling) occurs mainly via 1,2-hydride (deuteride) shift reaction in the intermediate isopropyl cation on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite.
It is worth noting again that the formation of isopropyl cation is the essential step of mechanism I to provide the regioselective exchange into methyl groups on both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites. However, we have observed isopropoxy intermediate, which is the product of propylene protonation, only on ZnO/H-BEA. Moreover, for mechanism I, the rate determining stage of the H/D exchange should be the isopropyl cation formation, and, therefore, the apparent activation energies of the exchange have to be similar for both Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites. In fact, they are different. This presumes that mechanism I is not realized for both zeolite samples. Hence, the regioselective exchange on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite can occur via mechanism II or III.
Thus, the H/D exchange of propane-d8 on ZnO/H-BEA can be realized by the following manner. On the first stage, the regioselective H/D exchange into methyl group occurs by mechanisms II or III. During the induction period, the accumulation of propylene by propane dehydrogenation on ZnO species occurs. Further protonation of propylene gives isopropyl cations in a quantity sufficient to provide fast intramolecular H-scrambling by 1,2-hydride shift reaction. Following intermolecular hydride shift reaction of isopropyl cation with deuterated propane
[61]
leads to protium label transfer into the methylene group of propane (
Scheme 1
, pathway b). This results in the disappearance of the regioselectivity of the exchange after the induction period and the involvement of both methyl and methylene groups in the reaction with similar apparent rate constants.
3.5. Kinetics modeling of the H/D exchange of propane on ZnO/H-BEA
To support our conclusions on the possible mechanism of the H/D exchange, we have further performed modeling of the experimental kinetics. This helps us to find out whether our view on the mechanism allows decent description of the experimental kinetics for both the CH3 and CH2 groups of propane including the observed induction period. The stages used for kinetics modeling are shown in

Reactions (1) and (2) represent direct H/D exchange of either the CH3 or CH2 groups with BAS with the rate constants ka and kb. Reactions (3) and (4) describe propylene formation via the dehydrogenation of propane molecules with different deuterium isotope contents (the rate constant kH2). Stage (5) with the rate constant kpr takes into account equilibration of protium between propylene and BAS with the performance of intramolecular hydrogen scrambling in protonated propylene. Finally, the steps (6) and (7) correspond to the transformation of the protonated olefin to propane (the rate constant kHtr) via hydride transfer reaction (
Scheme 1
).
Fig. 6
shows that experimental kinetics are well described, including the induction period, on the basis of reactions (1)–(7) (
Table 2
). The direct H/D exchange of BAS with the methyl groups is notably faster than with methylene group (ka ≫ kb). The dehydrogenation step (kH2) is much slower and the hydride transfer step (kHtr) is significantly faster compared to the direct exchange of methyl groups with BAS (kH2 ≪ ka ≪ kHtr). Both the rate constants kH2 and kHtr depend on the quantity of propylene produced at the end of the reaction. We assume that similar quantity (ca. 10 µmol g−1) of propylene is formed independently of the reaction temperature. The amount of propylene formed was estimated based on the analysis of the signal intensities in 13C MAS NMR spectra.

Table 2
were obtained by semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method with an accuracy of ca. 10–40%.
We have found that activation barriers for ka and kb (
Fig. 7
) are close to the values derived from the first order kinetics law (
Fig. 4
). The step with the highest energy barrier is the equilibration of protium between propylene and BAS (kpr, Ea = 146 ± 23 kJ mol−1). This can be explained by the necessity to perform propylene protonation and further formation of energetically unfavorable primary cation at 1,2-hydride shift reaction in the intermediate isopropyl cation. On the contrary, the step of intermolecular hydride transfer between propane and isopropyl cation (kHtr) occurs easily and requires activation barrier of ∼12 kJ mol−1, which is similar to the activation barrier for hydride transfer between tert-butyl cation and isobutane in superacids (Ea = 15 kJ mol−1)

3.6. The effect of Zn-species nature on the H/D hydrogen exchange reaction. Which species, either ZnO clusters or Zn2+cations, are involved in the synergistic action of Zn and BAS for propane CH bonds activation?
The analysis of the kinetics allows us to clarify the peculiarities of the H/D exchange and activation of propane on Zn-modified zeolite, which could contain Zn-species of different state and composition. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher. The influence of Zn on the rate of the H/D exchange reaction supports the involvement of the Zn-species in the key step of hydrogen exchange thus making the mechanisms of this reaction to be different for pure acid-form zeolites. The Zn-species effect confirms earlier suggested synergy of BAS and the metal species for the activation of propane CH bonds on Zn- and Ga-modified zeolites
[4]
,
[65]
,
[66]
. It should be emphasized here that both Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters are responsible for the synergistic action with BAS for propane CH bonds activation.
Interestingly, both Zn2+ cations and ZnO species demonstrate the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane. This stage is initiated after the accumulation of sufficient amount of propylene during the induction period. The scrambling occurs via propylene protonation resulting in isopropyl cation formation. Since ZnO clusters retain propylene weakly, its protonation by BAS is possible on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite. Contrary, propylene is more strongly coordinated to Zn2+ cations on Zn2+/H-BEA and, therefore, is not undergone protonation by BAS. This maintains the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange for propane on Zn2+/H-BEA, occurring by either mechanism II or III, during whole course of the reaction.
4. Conclusion
Two Zn-modified BEA zeolites, loaded with different Zn-species, have been examined with respect to their ability to activate CH bonds in propane molecule. This has been done by monitoring the kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between propane-d8 and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the zeolites with 1H MAS NMR in situ. One of the Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA sample) contained zinc exclusively in the form of isolated Zn2+ cations which partially substituted BAS. The other one (ZnO/H-BEA sample) contained only zinc oxide ZnnOn (n = 2–5) clusters of small dimension located inside the zeolite intracrystalline void with the concentration of BAS being intact as in parent H-BEA zeolite.
The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite. The effect of the H/D exchange acceleration provided by the presence of Zn2+ cations in zeolite is higher than the effect of ZnO clusters. These data support that both isolated Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters are responsible for the synergistic action with BAS for CH bond activation in propane.
For Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, the exchange is regioselective into the methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is observed only for the beginning of the reaction. Further, the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange with the apparent rate constant similar to that for the methyl groups.
The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane.
Propylene is presumably held by Zn2+ cations more strongly than by ZnO species. This does not allow the formation of isopropyl cation in the quantity sufficient to perform the regioselectivity of the exchange by mechanism I (pathway a in
Scheme 1
) on Zn2+/H-BEA. Also, the involvement of isopropyl cation in the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA only at the stage of intramolecular H/D-scrambling supports the conclusion that authentic regioselectivity of the H/D exchange in propane on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites could be realized by mechanisms II or III, but not by mechanism I. Moreover, considering the data on the apparent rate constants of the H/D exchange and ZnCH3 species formation on Zn2+/H-ZSM-5
[44]
,
[56]
, we conclude that mechanism III is most probable for the regioselective H/D exchange of propane with BAS on Zn-modified zeolites.
